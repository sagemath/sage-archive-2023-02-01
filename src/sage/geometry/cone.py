Convex rational polyhedral cones

This module was designed as a part of framework for toric varieties
(:mod:`~sage.schemes.toric.variety`,
:mod:`~sage.schemes.toric.fano_variety`). While the emphasis is on
strictly convex cones, non-strictly convex cones are supported as well. Work
with distinct lattices (in the sense of discrete subgroups spanning vector
spaces) is supported. The default lattice is :class:`ToricLattice
<sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>` `N` of the appropriate
dimension. The only case when you must specify lattice explicitly is creation
of a 0-dimensional cone, where dimension of the ambient space cannot be
guessed.

EXAMPLES:

Use :func:`Cone` to construct cones::

    sage: octant = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)])
    sage: halfspace = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,-1,0), (0,0,1)])
    sage: positive_xy = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0)])
    sage: four_rays = Cone([(1,1,1), (1,-1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,1)])

For all of the cones above we have provided primitive generating rays, but in
fact this is not necessary - a cone can be constructed from any collection of
rays (from the same space, of course). If there are non-primitive (or even
non-integral) rays, they will be replaced with primitive ones. If there are
extra rays, they will be discarded. Of course, this means that :func:`Cone`
has to do some work before actually constructing the cone and sometimes it is
not desirable, if you know for sure that your input is already "good". In this
case you can use options ``check=False`` to force :func:`Cone` to use
exactly the directions that you have specified and ``normalize=False`` to
force it to use exactly the rays that you have specified. However, it is
better not to use these possibilities without necessity, since cones are
assumed to be represented by a minimal set of primitive generating rays.
See :func:`Cone` for further documentation on construction.

Once you have a cone, you can perform numerous operations on it. The most
important ones are, probably, ray accessing methods::

    sage: rays = halfspace.rays()
    sage: rays
    N( 0,  0, 1),
    N( 0,  1, 0),
    N( 0, -1, 0),
    N( 1,  0, 0),
    N(-1,  0, 0)
    in 3-d lattice N
    sage: rays.set()
    frozenset([N(1, 0, 0), N(-1, 0, 0), N(0, 1, 0), N(0, 0, 1), N(0, -1, 0)])
    sage: rays.matrix()
    [ 0  0  1]
    [ 0  1  0]
    [ 0 -1  0]
    [ 1  0  0]
    [-1  0  0]
    sage: rays.column_matrix()
    [ 0  0  0  1 -1]
    [ 0  1 -1  0  0]
    [ 1  0  0  0  0]
    sage: rays(3)
    N(1, 0, 0)
    in 3-d lattice N
    sage: rays[3]
    N(1, 0, 0)
    sage: halfspace.ray(3)
    N(1, 0, 0)

The method :meth:`~IntegralRayCollection.rays` returns a
:class:`~sage.geometry.point_collection.PointCollection` with the
`i`-th element being the primitive integral generator of the `i`-th
ray. It is possible to convert this collection to a matrix with either
rows or columns corresponding to these generators. You may also change
the default
:meth:`~sage.geometry.point_collection.PointCollection.output_format`
of all point collections to be such a matrix.

If you want to do something with each ray of a cone, you can write ::

    sage: for ray in positive_xy: print ray
    N(1, 0, 0)
    N(0, 1, 0)

There are two dimensions associated to each cone - the dimension of the
subspace spanned by the cone and the dimension of the space where it lives::

    sage: positive_xy.dim()
    2
    sage: positive_xy.lattice_dim()
    3

You also may be interested in this dimension::

    sage: dim(positive_xy.linear_subspace())
    0
    sage: dim(halfspace.linear_subspace())
    2

Or, perhaps, all you care about is whether it is zero or not::

    sage: positive_xy.is_strictly_convex()
    True
    sage: halfspace.is_strictly_convex()
    False

You can also perform these checks::

    sage: positive_xy.is_simplicial()
    True
    sage: four_rays.is_simplicial()
    False
    sage: positive_xy.is_smooth()
    True

You can work with subcones that form faces of other cones::

    sage: face = four_rays.faces(dim=2)[0]
    sage: face
    2-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N
    sage: face.rays()
    N(1,  1, 1),
    N(1, -1, 1)
    in 3-d lattice N
    sage: face.ambient_ray_indices()
    (0, 1)
    sage: four_rays.rays(face.ambient_ray_indices())
    N(1,  1, 1),
    N(1, -1, 1)
    in 3-d lattice N

If you need to know inclusion relations between faces, you can use ::

    sage: L = four_rays.face_lattice()
    sage: map(len, L.level_sets())
    [1, 4, 4, 1]
    sage: face = L.level_sets()[2][0]
    sage: face.rays()
    N(1,  1, 1),
    N(1, -1, 1)
    in 3-d lattice N
    sage: L.hasse_diagram().neighbors_in(face)
    [1-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N,
     1-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N]

.. WARNING::

    The order of faces in level sets of
    the face lattice may differ from the order of faces returned by
    :meth:`~ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.faces`. While the first order is
    random, the latter one ensures that one-dimensional faces are listed in
    the same order as generating rays.

When all the functionality provided by cones is not enough, you may want to
check if you can do necessary things using lattice polytopes and polyhedra
corresponding to cones::

    sage: four_rays.lattice_polytope()
    A lattice polytope: 3-dimensional, 5 vertices.
    sage: four_rays.polyhedron()
    A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as
    the convex hull of 1 vertex and 4 rays

And of course you are always welcome to suggest new features that should be
added to cones!

def Cone(rays, lattice=None, check=True, normalize=True):
    r"""
    Construct a (not necessarily strictly) convex rational polyhedral cone.

    INPUT:

    - ``rays`` -- a list of rays. Each ray should be given as a list
      or a vector convertible to the rational extension of the given
      ``lattice``. May also be specified by a
      :class:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base` object;

    - ``lattice`` -- :class:`ToricLattice
      <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, `\ZZ^n`, or any
      other object that behaves like these. If not specified, an attempt will
      be made to determine an appropriate toric lattice automatically;

    - ``check`` -- by default the input data will be checked for
      correctness (e.g. that all rays have the same number of
      components) and generating rays will be constructed from
      ``rays``. If you know that the input is a minimal set of
      generators of a valid cone, you may significantly decrease
      construction time using ``check=False`` option;

    - ``normalize`` -- you can further speed up construction using
      ``normalize=False`` option. In this case ``rays`` must be a list of
      immutable primitive rays in ``lattice``. In general, you should not use
      this option, it is designed for code optimization and does not give as
      drastic improvement in speed as the previous one.

    OUTPUT:

    - convex rational polyhedral cone determined by ``rays``.

    EXAMPLES:

    Let's define a cone corresponding to the first quadrant of the plane
    (note, you can even mix objects of different types to represent rays, as
    long as you let this function to perform all the checks and necessary
    conversions!)::

        sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), [0,1]])
        sage: quadrant
        2-d cone in 2-d lattice N
        sage: quadrant.rays()
        N(1, 0),
        N(0, 1)
        in 2-d lattice N

    If you give more rays than necessary, the extra ones will be discarded::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,1)]).rays()
        N(0, 1),
        N(1, 0)
        in 2-d lattice N

    However, this work is not done with ``check=False`` option, so use it
    carefully! ::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,1)], check=False).rays()
        N(1, 0),
        N(0, 1),
        N(1, 1),
        N(0, 1)
        in 2-d lattice N

    Even worse things can happen with ``normalize=False`` option::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1)], check=False, normalize=False)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'parent'

    You can construct different "not" cones: not full-dimensional, not
    strictly convex, not containing any rays::

        sage: one_dimensional_cone = Cone([(1,0)])
        sage: one_dimensional_cone.dim()
        1
        sage: half_plane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
        sage: half_plane.rays()
        N( 0, 1),
        N( 1, 0),
        N(-1, 0)
        in 2-d lattice N
        sage: half_plane.is_strictly_convex()
        False
        sage: origin = Cone([(0,0)])
        sage: origin.rays()
        Empty collection
        in 2-d lattice N
        sage: origin.dim()
        0
        sage: origin.lattice_dim()
        2

    You may construct the cone above without giving any rays, but in this case
    you must provide ``lattice`` explicitly::

        sage: origin = Cone([])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: lattice must be given explicitly if there are no rays!
        sage: origin = Cone([], lattice=ToricLattice(2))
        sage: origin.dim()
        0
        sage: origin.lattice_dim()
        2
        sage: origin.lattice()
        2-d lattice N

    Of course, you can also provide ``lattice`` in other cases::

        sage: L = ToricLattice(3, "L")
        sage: c1 = Cone([(1,0,0),(1,1,1)], lattice=L)
        sage: c1.rays()
        L(1, 0, 0),
        L(1, 1, 1)
        in 3-d lattice L

    Or you can construct cones from rays of a particular lattice::

        sage: ray1 = L(1,0,0)
        sage: ray2 = L(1,1,1)
        sage: c2 = Cone([ray1, ray2])
        sage: c2.rays()
        L(1, 0, 0),
        L(1, 1, 1)
        in 3-d lattice L
        sage: c1 == c2
        True

    When the cone in question is not strictly convex, the standard form for
    the "generating rays" of the linear subspace is "basis vectors and their
    negatives", as in the following example::

        sage: plane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1)])
        sage: plane.rays()
        N( 0,  1),
        N( 0, -1),
        N( 1,  0),
        N(-1,  0)
        in 2-d lattice N

    The cone can also be specified by a
    :class:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base`::

        sage: p = plane.polyhedron()
        sage: Cone(p)
        2-d cone in 2-d lattice N
        sage: Cone(p) == plane
        True

    TESTS::

        sage: N = ToricLattice(2)

        sage: Cone(Nsub.basis())

    Create a collection of integral rays.

    .. WARNING::

        No correctness check or normalization is performed on the input data.
        This class is designed for internal operations and you probably should
        not use it directly.

    This is a base class for :class:`convex rational polyhedral cones
    <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>` and :class:`fans
    <sage.geometry.fan.RationalPolyhedralFan>`.

    Ray collections are immutable, but they cache most of the returned values.

    INPUT:

    - ``rays`` -- list of immutable vectors in ``lattice``;

    - ``lattice`` -- :class:`ToricLattice
      <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, `\ZZ^n`, or any
      other object that behaves like these. If ``None``, it will be determined
      as :func:`parent` of the first ray. Of course, this cannot be done if
      there are no rays, so in this case you must give an appropriate
      ``lattice`` directly. Note that ``None`` is *not* the default value -
      you always *must* give this argument explicitly, even if it is ``None``.

    - collection of given integral rays.

    Create a convex rational polyhedral cone.

    .. WARNING::

        This class does not perform any checks of correctness of input nor
        does it convert input into the standard representation. Use
        :func:`Cone` to construct cones.

    Cones are immutable, but they cache most of the returned values.

    INPUT:

    The input can be either:

    - ``rays`` -- list of immutable primitive vectors in ``lattice``;

    - ``lattice`` -- :class:`ToricLattice
      <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, `\ZZ^n`, or any
      other object that behaves like these. If ``None``, it will be determined
      as :func:`parent` of the first ray. Of course, this cannot be done if
      there are no rays, so in this case you must give an appropriate
      ``lattice`` directly.

    or (these parameters must be given as keywords):

    - ``ambient`` -- ambient structure of this cone, a bigger :class:`cone
      <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>` or a :class:`fan
      <sage.geometry.fan.RationalPolyhedralFan>`, this cone *must be a face
      of* ``ambient``;

    - ``ambient_ray_indices`` -- increasing list or tuple of integers, indices
      of rays of ``ambient`` generating this cone.

    In both cases, the following keyword parameter may be specified in addition:

    - ``PPL`` -- either ``None`` (default) or a
      :class:`~sage.libs.ppl.C_Polyhedron` representing the cone. This
      serves only to cache the polyhedral data if you know it
      already. The polyhedron will be set immutable.

    OUTPUT:

    - convex rational polyhedral cone.

    .. NOTE::

        Every cone has its ambient structure. If it was not specified, it is
        this cone itself.

            1-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N

        Things are a little bit subtle with fans, as we illustrate below.

        First, we create a fan from two cones in the plane::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            1

        The second generating cone is adjacent to this one. Now we create the
        same fan, but embedded into the 3-dimensional space::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,0,0)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            1

        The result is as before, since we still have::

            sage: fan.dim()
            2

        Now we add another cone to make the fan 3-dimensional::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2), (3,)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,0,0), (0,0,1)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            0

        Since now ``cone`` has smaller dimension than ``fan``, it and its
        adjacent cones must be facets of a bigger one, but since ``cone``
        in this example is generating, it is not contained in any other.

        Return the cone equivalent to the given one, but sitting in ``self`` as

        You may need to use this method before calling methods of ``cone`` that

        :meth:`~sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.ambient_ray_indices`
        or
        :meth:`~sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.facet_of`. The
        cone returned by this method will have ``self`` as ambient. If ``cone``
        does not represent a valid cone of ``self``, ``ValueError`` exception
        is raised.

        .. NOTE::

            This method is very quick if ``self`` is already the ambient
            structure of ``cone``, so you can use without extra checks and
            performance hit even if ``cone`` is likely to sit in ``self`` but
            in principle may not.

        - a :class:`cone <sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>`,

            sage: c = Cone([(1,0,1), (0,1,1), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1)])

        Then any ray generates a 1-d face of this cone, but if you construct
        such a face directly, it will not "sit" inside the cone::

        Return the face lattice of ``self``.

        This lattice will have the origin as the bottom (we do not include the
        empty set as a face) and this cone itself as the top.

        OUTPUT:

        - :class:`finite poset <sage.combinat.posets.posets.FinitePoset>` of
          :class:`cones <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Let's take a look at the face lattice of the first quadrant::

            sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
            sage: L = quadrant.face_lattice()
            sage: L
            Finite poset containing 4 elements

        To see all faces arranged by dimension, you can do this::

            sage: for level in L.level_sets(): print level
            [0-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N]
            [1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,
             1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N]
            [2-d cone in 2-d lattice N]

        For a particular face you can look at its actual rays... ::

            sage: face = L.level_sets()[1][0]
            sage: face.rays()
            N(1, 0)
            in 2-d lattice N

        ... or you can see the index of the ray of the original cone that
        corresponds to the above one::

            sage: face.ambient_ray_indices()
            (0,)
            sage: quadrant.ray(0)
            N(1, 0)

        An alternative to extracting faces from the face lattice is to use
        :meth:`faces` method::

            sage: face is quadrant.faces(dim=1)[0]
            True

        The advantage of working with the face lattice directly is that you
        can (relatively easily) get faces that are related to the given one::

            sage: face = L.level_sets()[1][0]
            sage: D = L.hasse_diagram()
            sage: D.neighbors(face)
            [2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,
             0-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N]

        However, you can achieve some of this functionality using
        :meth:`facets`, :meth:`facet_of`, and :meth:`adjacent` methods::

            sage: face = quadrant.faces(1)[0]
            sage: face
            1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N
            sage: face.rays()
            N(1, 0)
            in 2-d lattice N
            sage: face.facets()
            (0-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,)
            sage: face.facet_of()
            (2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,)
            sage: face.adjacent()
            (1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,)
            sage: face.adjacent()[0].rays()
            N(0, 1)
            in 2-d lattice N

        Note that if ``cone`` is a face of ``supercone``, then the face
        lattice of ``cone`` consists of (appropriate) faces of ``supercone``::

            sage: supercone = Cone([(1,2,3,4), (5,6,7,8),
            ...                     (1,2,4,8), (1,3,9,7)])
            sage: supercone.face_lattice()
            Finite poset containing 16 elements
            sage: supercone.face_lattice().top()
            4-d cone in 4-d lattice N
            sage: cone = supercone.facets()[0]
            sage: cone
            3-d face of 4-d cone in 4-d lattice N
            sage: cone.face_lattice()
            Finite poset containing 8 elements
            sage: cone.face_lattice().bottom()
            0-d face of 4-d cone in 4-d lattice N
            sage: cone.face_lattice().top()
            3-d face of 4-d cone in 4-d lattice N
            sage: cone.face_lattice().top() == cone
            True

            sage: C1 = Cone([(0,1)])

        Return faces of ``self`` of specified (co)dimension.

        INPUT:

        - ``dim`` -- integer, dimension of the requested faces;

        - ``codim`` -- integer, codimension of the requested faces.

        .. NOTE::

            You can specify at most one parameter. If you don't give any, then
            all faces will be returned.

        OUTPUT:

        - if either ``dim`` or ``codim`` is given, the output will be a
          :class:`tuple` of :class:`cones <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>`;

        - if neither ``dim`` nor ``codim`` is given, the output will be the
          :class:`tuple` of tuples as above, giving faces of all existing
          dimensions. If you care about inclusion relations between faces,
          consider using :meth:`face_lattice` or :meth:`adjacent`,
          :meth:`facet_of`, and :meth:`facets`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Let's take a look at the faces of the first quadrant::

            sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
            sage: quadrant.faces()
            ((0-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,),
             (1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,
              1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N),
             (2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,))
            sage: quadrant.faces(dim=1)
            (1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,
             1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N)
            sage: face = quadrant.faces(dim=1)[0]

        Now you can look at the actual rays of this face... ::

            sage: face.rays()
            N(1, 0)
            in 2-d lattice N

        ... or you can see indices of the rays of the orginal cone that
        correspond to the above ray::

            sage: face.ambient_ray_indices()
            (0,)
            sage: quadrant.ray(0)
            N(1, 0)

        Note that it is OK to ask for faces of too small or high dimension::

            sage: quadrant.faces(-1)
            ()
            sage: quadrant.faces(3)
            ()

        In the case of non-strictly convex cones even faces of small
        non-negative dimension may be missing::

            sage: halfplane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
            sage: halfplane.faces(0)
            ()
            sage: halfplane.faces()
            ((1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,),
             (2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,))
            sage: plane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1)])
            sage: plane.faces(1)
            ()
            sage: plane.faces()
            ((2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,),)

        TESTS:

        Now we check that "general" cones whose dimension is smaller than the
        dimension of the ambient space work as expected (see Trac #9188)::

            sage: c = Cone([(1,1,1,3),(1,-1,1,3),(-1,-1,1,3)])
            sage: c.faces()
            ((0-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,),
             (1-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,
              1-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,
              1-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N),
             (2-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,
              2-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,
              2-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N),
             (3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,))

        We also ensure that a call to this function does not break
        :meth:`facets` method (see :trac:`9780`)::

            sage: cone = toric_varieties.dP8().fan().generating_cone(0)

        ``ZZ^n``) that does not have a ``dual()`` method, the facet normals
        will be returned as integral vectors.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: cone = Cone([(1,0), (-1,3)])
            sage: cone.facet_normals()
            M(3, 1),
            M(0, 1)
            in 2-d lattice M

        Now let's look at a more complicated case::

            sage: cone = Cone([(-2,-1,2), (4,1,0), (-4,-1,-5), (4,1,5)])
            sage: cone.is_strictly_convex()

            sage: cone.linear_subspace().dimension()
            1
            sage: lsg = (QQ^3)(cone.linear_subspace().gen(0)); lsg
            (1, 1/4, 5/4)
            sage: cone.facet_normals()
            M(7, -18, -2),
            M(1,  -4,  0)
            in 3-d lattice M
            sage: [lsg*normal for normal in cone.facet_normals()]
            [0, 0]

        A lattice that does not have a ``dual()`` method::

            sage: Cone([(1,1),(0,1)], lattice=ZZ^2).facet_normals()
            ( 1, 0),
            (-1, 1)
            in Ambient free module of rank 2
            over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring

        We correctly handle the degenerate cases::

        If the cone is not simplicial, it is first triangulated. Each
        simplicial subcone has the integral points of the spaned
        parallelotope as generators. This is the first step of the
        primal Normaliz algorithm, see [Normaliz]_. For each
        simplicial cone (of dimension `d`), the integral points of the
        open parallelotope

            \right\}

        Return the Hilbert basis of the cone.

        Given a strictly convex cone `C\subset \RR^d`, the Hilbert
        basis of `C` is the set of all irreducible elements in the
        semigroup `C\cap \ZZ^d`. It is the unique minimal generating
        set over `\ZZ` for the integral points `C\cap \ZZ^d`.

        If the cone `C` is not strictly convex, this method finds the
        (unique) minimial set of lattice points that need to be added
        to the defining rays of the cone to generate the whole
        semigroup `C\cap \ZZ^d`. But because the rays of the cone are
        not unique nor necessarily minimal in this case, neither is
        the returned generating set (consisting of the rays plus
        additional generators).

        Not a strictly convex cone::

            sage: wedge = Cone([ (1,0,0), (1,2,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,-1) ])
            sage: wedge.semigroup_generators()

            sage: wedge.Hilbert_basis()
            N(1, 2,  0),
            N(1, 0,  0),
            N(0, 0,  1),
            N(0, 0, -1),
            N(1, 1,  0)
            in 3-d lattice N

        Not full-dimensional cones are ok, too (see
        http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11312)::

            sage: Cone([(1,1,0), (-1,1,0)]).Hilbert_basis()
            N( 1, 1, 0),
            N(-1, 1, 0),
            N( 0, 1, 0)

        Return the expansion coefficients of ``point`` with respect to
        :meth:`Hilbert_basis`.

        INPUT:

        - ``point`` -- a :meth:`~IntegralRayCollection.lattice` point
          in the cone, or something that can be converted to a
          point. For example, a list or tuple of integers.

        OUTPUT:

        A `\ZZ`-vector of length ``len(self.Hilbert_basis())`` with nonnegative
        components.

        .. note::

            Since the Hilbert basis elements are not necessarily linearly
            independent, the expansion coefficients are not unique. However,
            this method will always return the same expansion coefficients when
            invoked with the same argument.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: cone = Cone([(1,0),(0,1)])
            sage: cone.rays()

            sage: cone = Cone([N(1,0),N(1,2)])

            sage: cone.Hilbert_coefficients( N(1,1) )
