# William Stein, 2005-12-20 -- removed "m" option from tar,
# which was seriously confusing the build process on some
# (too fast?) machines, especially for mpfr.

#######################################################
#  Install a SAGE package.  This script is
#  typically invoked by giving the command
#      sage -i <package name>
#
#  A package may assume that the following environment
#  variables are defined:
#
#      SAGE_ROOT   -- root directory of sage install
#      SAGE_LOCAL  -- $SAGE_ROOT/local
#      SAGE_DATA   -- $SAGE_ROOT/data
#      LIBRARY_PATH, PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
#      CC, CXX, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS, MAKE
#
#  Your package script should try to build using the giving CC, CXX,
#  CFLAGS, MAKE, etc, via a file spkg-install in your script.
#
#  This script does the following:
#
#      1. Set environment variables (by calling sage-env)
#      2. Decompress package into a build directory
#      3. Run the script in the package called spkg-install
#      4. Return error 1 if anything goes wrong.
