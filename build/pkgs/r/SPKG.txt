== Description ==
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment
which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent
Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a
different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but
much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

=== Patches ===
 * configure.patch: Use -### instead of -v to detect linker options.
   See Sage ticket #12787 and upstream ticket
   https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14865
   The corresponding patch to m4/clibs.m4 is not included, as
   autoconf-2.68 gives errors, even on the clean upstream sources.
 * R.sh.in: Set R_HOME_DIR to "${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/R/" when running R.
 * scripts.Makefile.in.patch: the file src/src/scripts/R.sh.in
   defines R_SHARE_DIR, R_INCLUDE_DIR, and R_DOC_DIR relative to
   R_HOME_DIR, but scripts/Makefile.in hardcodes these
   locations. This patch removes this hardcoding. See Sage trac
   #9668.
 * libintl-visibility.patch: fix visibility of symbols for optional
   libintl library.

=== r-2.15.2.p2 (John H. Palmieri, 17 March 2013) ===
 * #9668: fix hardcoding of paths in R by defining R_SHARE_DIR,
   R_INCLUDE_DIR, and R_DOC_DIR relative to R_HOME_DIR, or rather, by

   paths.

   about a "reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!".

   (ticket #14008).

=== r-2.14.0.p6 (Jeroen Demeyer, 10 September 2012) ===
 * #13443: some clean up of spkg-install.
 * Compile R with optimization (at -O2 level).
 * No longer pass -I and -L options to gcc (see #13348).
 * No longer use sage_fortran (see #13349).
 * Re-enable parallel make install, which works now (see #13428).

=== r-2.14.0.p5 (Jeroen Demeyer, 4 September 2012) ===

 * #12787: use -### instead of -v to detect linker options
 * Don't export OSXFW in spkg-install
 * Remove "export MAKE=make" and "export MAKEFLAGS=".  Instead, install
   with -j1.
 * Removed the fix_hardcode Python script, found simpler work-around
   using environment variable SAGE_BUILDING_R set in spkg-install.
 * Use `patch` for patching.

=== r-2.14.0.p2 (John H. Palmieri, 17 Dec 2011) ===
 * #12172: unconditionally disable X11 support on Darwin

=== r-2.14.0.p1 (Simon King, 10 Dec 2011) ===
 * #12131: use --libdir, to make the package work on openSUSE

=== r-2.14.0.p0 (Volker Braun, 19th November 2011) ===
 * #12057: upgrade to new upstream version

=== r-2.10.1.p4 (Leif Leonhardy, September 25th 2010) ===
 * #10016: Don't call "sage -f" on the included Rpy spkg, instead call
   "sage-spkg -f" directly, since only this is guaranteed to be present.
   This is just a temporary solution, until the Rpy spkg is removed
   from this one.

=== r-2.10.1.p3 (Mariah Lenox, 30 Jun 2010) ===
 * added "--with-ICU=no" to configure line of spkg-install (#9396)

=== r-2.10.1.p2 (Mitesh Patel, June 8th 2010) ===
 * #9186: Set an empty MAKEFLAGS variable before "make install".  On
   OS X, at least, this fixes building multiple spkgs in parallel (cf.
   #8306).

=== r-2.10.1.p1 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, April 12th 2010) ===
 * Re-enable Aqua support on OSX

=== r-2.10.1.p0 (David Kirkby, February 16th 2010) ===
 * Several items all covered by #8285
 * Added the undocumented option "--without-ICU" on Solaris,
   as that allows R to build - otherwise it fails. I suspect the
   ideal solution would be to add the ICU library from
   http://site.icu-project.org/
   but this option does allow R to build.
 * Ensure SAGE64 will add the -m64 option on any platform,
   not just OS X as before.
 * Removed all references to the option --with-iconv=no,
   as R needs iconv now - it is no longer optional - see
   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/8191
 * Implement a test for X on Solaris, as the previous test in
   spkg-install would always fail on Solaris, as Solaris
   lacks the header file checked for, despite the fact X
   support works fine. So now I check for a library on Solaris.
