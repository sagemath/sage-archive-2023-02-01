Hypergraph generators

At the moment this module only implement one method, which calls Brendan McKay's
Nauty (`<http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/>`_) to enumerate hypergraphs up to
isomorphism.

        Enumerates hypergraphs up to isomorphism using Nauty.

        INPUT:

        - ``number_of_sets``, ``number_of_vertices`` (integers)

        - ``multiple_sets`` (boolean) -- whether to allow several sets
          of the hypergraph to be equal (set to ``False`` by default).

        - ``vertex_min_degree``, ``vertex_max_degree`` (integers) -- define the
          maximum and minimum degree of an element from the ground set (i.e. the
          number of sets which contain it). Set to ``None`` by default.

        - ``set_min_size``, ``set_max_size`` (integers) -- define the maximum
          and minimum size of a set. Set to ``None`` by default.

        - ``regular`` (integer) -- if set to an integer value `k`, requires the
          hypergraphs to be `k`-regular. It is actually a shortcut for the
          corresponing min/max values.

        - ``uniform`` (integer) -- if set to an integer value `k`, requires the
          hypergraphs to be `k`-uniform. It is actually a shortcut for the
          corresponing min/max values.

        - ``max_intersection`` (integer) -- constraints the maximum cardinality
          of the intersection of two sets fro the hypergraphs. Set to ``None``
          by default.

        - ``connected`` (boolean) -- whether to require the hypergraphs to be
          connected. Set to ``False`` by default.

        - ``debug`` (boolean) -- if ``True`` the first line of genbg's output to
          standard error is captured and the first call to the generator's
          ``next()`` function will return this line as a string.  A line leading
          with ">A" indicates a successful initiation of the program with some
          information on the arguments, while a line beginning with ">E"
          indicates an error with the input.

        - ``options`` (string) -- anything else that should be forwarded as
          input to Nauty's genbg. See its documentation for more information :
          `<http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/>`_.

          .. NOTE::

              For genbg the *first class* elements are vertices, and *second
              class* elements are the hypergraph's sets.

        OUTPUT:

        A tuple of tuples.
