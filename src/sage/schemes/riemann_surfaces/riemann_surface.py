Riemann matrices and endomorphism rings of algebraic Riemann surfaces

This module provides a class, :class:`RiemannSurface`, to model the
Riemann surface determined by a plane algebraic curve over a subfield
of the complex numbers.

A homology basis is derived from the edges of a Voronoi cell decomposition based
on the branch locus. The pull-back of these edges to the Riemann surface
provides a graph on it that contains a homology basis.

The class provides methods for computing the Riemann period matrix of the
surface numerically, using a certified homotopy continuation method due to
[Kr2016]_.

The class also provides facilities for computing the endomorphism ring of the
period lattice numerically, by determining integer (near) solutions to the
relevant approximate linear equations.

EXAMPLES:

We compute the Riemann matrix of a genus 3 curve::

    sage: from sage.schemes.riemann_surfaces.riemann_surface import RiemannSurface
    sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
    sage: f = x^4-x^3*y+2*x^3+2*x^2*y+2*x^2-2*x*y^2+4*x*y-y^3+3*y^2+2*y+1
    sage: S = RiemannSurface(f,prec=100)
    sage: M = S.riemann_matrix()

We test the usual properties, i.e., that the period matrix is symmetric and that
the imaginary part is positive definite::

    sage: all(abs(a) < 1e-20 for a in (M-M.T).list())
    True
    sage: iM = Matrix(RDF,3,3,[a.imag_part() for a in M.list()])
    sage: iM.is_positive_definite()
    True

We compute the endomorphism ring and check it has `\ZZ`-rank 6::

    sage: A = S.endomorphism_basis(80,8)
    sage: len(A) == 6
    True

In fact it is an order in a number field::

    sage: T.<t> = QQ[]
    sage: K.<a> = NumberField(t^6 - t^5 + 2*t^4 + 8*t^3 - t^2 - 5*t + 7)
    sage: all(len(a.minpoly().roots(K)) == a.minpoly().degree() for a in A)
    True

def voronoi_ghost(cpoints, n=6, CC=CDF):
    r"""
    Convert a set of complex points to a list of real tuples `(x,y)`, and
    appends n points in a big circle around them.

    The effect is that, with n >= 3, a Voronoi decomposition will have only
    finite cells around the original points. Furthermore, because the extra
    points are placed on a circle centered on the average of the given points,
    with a radius 3/2 times the largest distance between the center and the
    given points, these finite cells form a simply connected region.

    INPUT:

    A list of real tuples `(x,y)` consisting of the original points and a set of
    points which surround them.

def differential_basis_baker(f):
    r"""
    Compute a differential bases for a curve that is nonsingular outside (1:0:0),(0:1:0),(0:0:1)

    Baker's theorem tells us that if a curve has its singularities at the coordinate vertices and meets
    some further easily tested genericity criteria,
    then we can read off a basis for the regular differentials from the interior of the
    Newton polygon spanned by the monomials. While this theorem only applies to special plane curves
    it is worth implementing because the analysis is relatively cheap and it applies to a lot of
    commonly encountered curves (e.g., curves given by a hyperelliptic model). Other advantages include
    that we can do the computation over any exact base ring (the alternative Singular based method for
    computing the adjoint ideal requires the rationals), and that we can avoid being affected by subtle bugs
    in the Singular code.

    ``None`` is returned when ``f`` does not describe a curve of the relevant type. If ``f`` is of the relevant
    type, but is of genus `0` then ``[]`` is returned (which are both False values, but they are not equal).

class RiemannSurface(object):
    r"""
    Construct a Riemann Surface. This is specified by the zeroes of a bivariate
    polynomial with rational coefficients `f(z,w) = 0`.

    INPUT:

    - ``f`` -- a bivariate polynomial with rational coefficients. The surface is
      interpreted as the covering space of the coordinate plane in the first
      variable.

    - ``prec`` -- the desired precision of computations on the surface in bits
      (default: 53)

    - ``certification`` -- a boolean (default: True) value indicating whether
      homotopy continuation is certified or not. Uncertified homotopy
      continuation can be faster.

    - ``differentials`` -- (default: None). If specified, provides a list of
      polynomials `h` such that `h/(df/dw) dz` is a regular differential on the
      Riemann surface. This is taken as a basis of the regular differentials, so
      the genus is assumed to be equal to the length of this list. The results
      from the homology basis computation are checked against this value.
      Providing this parameter makes the computation independent from Singular.
      For a nonsingular plane curve of degree `d`, an appropriate set is given
      by the monomials of degree up to `d-3`.

    - ``integration_method`` -- (default: ``'heuristic'``). String specifying the 
      integration method to use when calculating the integrals of differentials. 
      The options are ``'heuristic'`` and ``'rigorous'``, the latter of
      which is often the most efficient. 

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.schemes.riemann_surfaces.riemann_surface import RiemannSurface
        sage: R.<z,w> = QQ[]
        sage: f = w^2 - z^3 + 1
        sage: RiemannSurface(f)
        Riemann surface defined by polynomial f = -z^3 + w^2 + 1 = 0, with 53 bits of precision

    Another Riemann surface with 100 bits of precision::

        sage: S = RiemannSurface(f, prec=100); S
        Riemann surface defined by polynomial f = -z^3 + w^2 + 1 = 0, with 100 bits of precision
        sage: S.riemann_matrix()^6 #abs tol 0.00000001

    We can also work with Riemann surfaces that are defined over fields with a
    complex embedding, but since the current interface for computing genus and
    regular differentials in Singular presently does not support extensions of
    QQ, we need to specify a description of the differentials ourselves. We give
    an example of a CM elliptic curve::

        sage: Qt.<t> = QQ[]
        sage: K.<a> = NumberField(t^2-t+3,embedding=CC(0.5+1.6*I))
        sage: R.<x,y> = K[]
        sage: f = y^2+y-(x^3+(1-a)*x^2-(2+a)*x-2)
        sage: S = RiemannSurface(f,prec=100,differentials=[1])
        sage: A = S.endomorphism_basis()
        sage: len(A)
        2
        sage: all( len(T.minpoly().roots(K)) > 0 for T in A)
        True

    The ``'heuristic'`` integration method uses the method ``integrate_vector`` 
    defined in ``sage.numerical.gauss_legendre`` to compute integrals of differentials. 
    As mentioned there, this works by iteratively doubling the number of nodes 
    used in the quadrature, and uses a heuristic based on the rate at which the
    result is seemingly converging to estimate the error. The ``'rigorous'``
    method uses results from [Neu2018]_, and bounds the algebraic integrands on 
    circular domains using Cauchy's form of the remainder in Taylor approximation
    coupled to Fujiwara's bound on polynomial roots (see Bruin-DisneyHogg-Gao,
    in preparation). Note this method of bounding on circular domains is also 
    implemented in :meth:`_compute_delta`. The net result of this bounding is 
    that one can know (an upper bound on) the number of nodes required to achieve
    a certain error. This means that for any given integral, assuming that the 
    same number of nodes is required by both methods in order to achieve the 
    desired error (not necessarily true in practice), approximately half
    the number of integrand evaluations are required. When the required number
    of nodes is high, e.g. when the precision required is high, this can make
    the ``'rigorous'`` method much faster. However, the ``'rigorous'`` method does
    not benefit as much from the caching of the ``nodes`` method over multiple
    integrals. The result of this is that, for calls of :meth:`matrix_of_integral_values`
    if the computation is 'fast', the heuristic method may outperform the
    rigorous method, but for slower computations the rigorous method can be much
    faster::
        
        sage: f = z*w^3+z^3+w
        sage: p = 53
        sage: Sh = RiemannSurface(f, prec=p, integration_method='heuristic')

        sage: ct = time.time()
        sage: Rh = Sh.riemann_matrix()  
        sage: ct1 = time.time()-ct
        sage: nodes.cache.clear()
        sage: ct = time.time()

        sage: ct2/ct1  # random
        0.6627716056083879

    This disparity in timings can get increasingly worse, and testing has shown
    that even for random quadrics the heuristic method can be as bad as 30 times
    slower. 

    TESTS:

    This elliptic curve has a relatively poorly conditioned set of branch
    points, so it challenges the path choice a bit. The code just verifies that
    the period is quadratic, because the curve has CM, but really the test is
    that the computation completes at all.::

          the w-values above ``z0``.

        - ``epsilon`` -- the minimum distance between the w-values divided by 3.

        OUTPUT:

        A complex number, which should be a w-value above ``z0``.

        However, if the Newton iteration exceeds the allotted attempts,
        or exits the ``epsilon`` ball, raises a convergence error.

        EXAMPLES:

        First, a trivial example where we guess exactly what the root is::

            sage: from sage.schemes.riemann_surfaces.riemann_surface import RiemannSurface
            sage: R.<z,w> = QQ[]
            sage: f = w^2 - z^4 + 1
            sage: S = RiemannSurface(f)
            sage: z0 = S._vertices[0]
            sage: epsilon = 0.1
            sage: oldw = S.w_values(z0)[0]
            sage: neww = S._newton_iteration(z0,oldw,epsilon); neww  # abs tol 0.00000001
            -0.934613146929672 + 2.01088055918363*I

        Which should be exactly the same as the w-value we started with::

            sage: oldw - neww  # abs tol 0.00000001
            0.000000000000000

        Here is an example where we exit the epsilon bound. This approach is
        based on the homotopy continuation procedure which traverses along a
        path and attempts Newton iteration::

        Using the error bounds for Gauss-Legendre integration found in [Neu2018]_
        and a method for bounding an algebraic integrand on a circular domains 
        using Cauchy's form of the remainder in Taylor approximation coupled to 
        Fujiwara's bound on polynomial roots (see Bruin-DisneyHogg-Gao, in 
        preparation), this method calculates (semi-)rigorously the integral of a 
        list of differentials along an edge of the upstairs graph.

        INPUT:

        - ``upstairs_edge`` -- a pair of integer tuples corresponding to an edge
          of the upstairs graph.

        - ``differentials`` -- a list of polynomials; a polynomial `g`
          represents the differential `g(z,w)/(df/dw) dz` where `f(z,w)=0` is
          the equation defining the Riemann surface.

        - ``bounding_data`` -- tuple containing the data required for bounding
          the integrands. This should be in the form of the output from 
          :meth:`_bounding_data`.

        OUTPUT:

        A complex number, the value of the line integral.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: from sage.schemes.riemann_surfaces.riemann_surface import RiemannSurface
            sage: R.<z,w> = QQ[]
            sage: f = w^2 - z^4 + 1
            sage: S = RiemannSurface(f); S
            Riemann surface defined by polynomial f = -z^4 + w^2 + 1 = 0, with 53 bits of precision

        Since we make use of data from homotopy continuation, we need to compute
        the necessary data::

            sage: _ = S.homology_basis()
            sage: differentials = S.cohomology_basis()
            sage: bounding_data = S._bounding_data(differentials)
            sage: S.rigorous_line_integral([(0,0), (1,0)], differentials, bounding_data)  # abs tol 1e-10
            (1.80277751848459e-16 - 0.352971844594760*I)

        .. NOTE::

            Uses data that ``homology_basis`` initializes. 

            Note also that the  data of the differentials is contained within
            ``bounding_data``. It is, however, still advantageous to have this 
            be a separate argument, as it lets the user supply a fast-callable
            version of the differentials, to significantly speed up execution 
            of the integrand calls, and not have to re-calculate these 
            fast-callables for every run of the function. This is also the benefit
            of representing the  differentials as a polynomial over a known 
            common denominator. 

        .. TODO::

            Note that bounding_data contains the information of the integrands,
            so one may want to check for consistency between ``bounding_data``
            and ``differentials``. If so one would not want to do so at the 
            expense of speed. 

            Moreover, the current implementation bounds along a line by 
            splitting it up into segments, each of which can be covered entirely
            by a single circle, and then placing inside that the ellipse 
            required to bound as per [Neu2018]_. This is reliably more efficient
            than the heuristic method, especially in poorly-conditioned cases 
            where discriminant points are close together around the edges, but
            in the case where the branch locus is well separated, it can require
            slightly more nodes than necessary. One may want to include a method
            here to transition in this regime to an algorithm that covers the 
            entire line with one ellipse, then bounds along that ellipse with 
            multiple circles.

        equations `MA + C = (MB + D)M` where `A, B, C, D` are `g\times g`
        integer matrices.  We determine small integer (near) solutions using LLL

    Determine integer relations between complex matrices.

    Given two square matrices with complex entries of size g, h respectively,
    numerically determine an (approximate) ZZ-basis for the 2g x 2h matrices
    with integer entries of the shape (D, B; C, A) such that B+M1*A=(D+M1*C)*M2.
    By considering real and imaginary parts separately we obtain `2gh` equations
    with real coefficients in `4gh` variables. We scale the coefficients by a
    constant `2^b` and round them to integers, in order to obtain an integer
    system of equations. Standard application of LLL allows us to determine near
    solutions.

    The user can specify the parameter `b`, but by default the system will
    choose a `b` based on the size of the coefficients and the precision with
    which they are given.

    INPUT:

    - ``M1`` -- square complex valued matrix

    - ``M2`` -- square complex valued matrix of same size as M1

    - ``b`` -- integer (default provided). The equation coefficients are scaled
      by `2^b` before rounding to integers.

    - ``r`` -- integer (default: ``b/4``). The vectors found by LLL that satisfy
      the scaled equations to within `2^r` are reported as solutions.

class RiemannSurfaceSum(RiemannSurface):

    Represent the disjoint union of finitely many Riemann surfaces.

    Rudimentary class to represent disjoint unions of Riemann surfaces. Exists
    mainly (and this is the only functionality actually implemented) to
    represents direct products of the complex tori that arise as analytic
    Jacobians of Riemann surfaces.

    INPUT:

    - L -- list of RiemannSurface objects
