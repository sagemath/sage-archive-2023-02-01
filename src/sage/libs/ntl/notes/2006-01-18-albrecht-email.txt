From Martin Albrecht:

I've added some methods to move between FiniteFields and ntl.GF2E, added
documentation and examples, added some wrappers around some more NTL
functions, introduced inheritance, added proper credits, and fixed that
NoModulus bug. However I didn't touch any other classes yet, so their coerce
methods don't know anything about ntl.(mat_)GF2(X|E) (yet). But
ntl.GF2X,ntl.GF2E, and ntl.mat_GF2E now have a method called sage() which
returns a matching SAGE polynomial, finite field element or matrix
respectively. Furthermore the constructors accept those classes as input now,
so you can switch between native SAGE and NTL quite nice. This is however not
extraordinary fast, the profiler blames the FiniteField and FiniteFieldElement
classes for this. So I added a dictionary to the sage() method for mat_GF2E
which speeds up everything quite a bit.
