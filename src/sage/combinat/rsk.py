EXAMPLES:

We can perform RSK and the inverse on a variety of objects::

    sage: p = Tableau([[1,2,2],[2]]); q = Tableau([[1,3,3],[2]])
    sage: gp = RSK_inverse(p, q); gp
    [[1, 2, 3, 3], [2, 1, 2, 2]]
    sage: RSK(*gp)
    [[[1, 2, 2], [2]], [[1, 3, 3], [2]]]
    sage: m = RSK_inverse(p, q, 'matrix'); m
    [0 1]
    [1 0]
    [0 2]
    sage: RSK(m)
    [[[1, 2, 2], [2]], [[1, 3, 3], [2]]]

the input is preserved::

    sage: t1 = Tableau([[1, 2, 5], [3], [4]])
    sage: t2 = Tableau([[1, 2, 3], [4], [5]])
    sage: gp = RSK_inverse(t1, t2); gp

    r"""
    Perform the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence.

    The Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence (also known
    as the RSK algorithm) is most naturally stated as a bijection
    between generalized permutations (also known as two-line arrays,
    biwords, ...) and pairs of semi-standard Young tableaux `(P, Q)`
    of identical shape. The tableau `P` is known as the insertion
    tableau, and `Q` is known as the recording tableau.

    The basic operation is known as row insertion `P \leftarrow k`
    (where `P` is a given semi-standard Young tableau, and `k` is an
    integer). Row insertion is a recursive algorithm which starts by
    setting `k_0 = k`, and in its `i`-th step inserts the number `k_i`
    into the `i`-th row of `P` (we start counting the rows at `0`) by
    replacing the first integer greater than `k_i` in the row by `k_i`
    and defines `k_{i+1}` as the integer that has been replaced. If no
    integer greater than `k_i` exists in the `i`-th row, then `k_i` is
    simply appended to the row and the algorithm terminates at this
    point.

    Now the RSK algorithm, applied to a generalized permutation
    `p = ((j_0, k_0), (j_1, k_1), \ldots, (j_{\ell-1}, k_{\ell-1}))`
    (encoded as a lexicographically sorted list of pairs) starts by
    initializing two semi-standard tableaux `P_0` and `Q_0` as empty
    tableaux. For each nonnegative integer `t` starting at `0`, take
    the pair `(j_t, k_t)` from `p` and set
    `P_{t+1} = P_t \leftarrow k_t`, and define `Q_{t+1}` by adding a
    new box filled with `j_t` to the tableau `Q_t` at the same
    location the row insertion on `P_t` ended (that is to say, adding
    a new box with entry `j_t` such that `P_{t+1}` and `Q_{t+1}` have
    the same shape). The iterative process stops when `t` reaches the
    size of `p`, and the pair `(P_t, Q_t)` at this point is the image
    of `p` under the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.

    This correspondence has been introduced in [Knu1970]_, where it has
    been referred to as "Construction A".

    For more information, see Chapter 7 in [Sta-EC2]_.

    We also note that integer matrices are in bijection with generalized
    permutations. Furthermore, we can convert any word `w` (and, in
    particular, any permutation) to a generalized permutation by
    considering the top line to be `(1, 2, \ldots, n)` where `n` is the
    length of `w`.

    The optional argument ``insertion`` allows to specify an alternative
    insertion procedure to be used instead of the standard
    Robinson-Schensted-Knuth insertion. If the input is a reduced word of
    a permutation (i.e., an element of a type-`A` Coxeter group), one can
    set ``insertion`` to ``'EG'``, which gives Edelman-Greene insertion,
    an algorithm defined in [EG1987]_ Definition 6.20 (where it is
    referred to as Coxeter-Knuth insertion). The Edelman-Greene insertion
    is similar to the standard row insertion except that if `k_i` and
    `k_i + 1` both exist in row `i`, we *only* set `k_{i+1} = k_i + 1` and
    continue.

    One can also perform a "Hecke RSK algorithm", defined using the
    Hecke insertion studied in [BKSTY06]_ (but using rows instead of
    columns). The algorithm proceeds similarly to the classical RSK
    algorithm. However, it is not clear in what generality it works;
    thus, following [BKSTY06]_, we shall assume that our biword `p`
    has top line `(1, 2, \ldots, n)` (or, at least, has its top line
    strictly increasing). The Hecke RSK algorithm returns a pair of
    an increasing tableau and a set-valued standard tableau. If
    `p = ((j_0, k_0), (j_1, k_1), \ldots, (j_{\ell-1}, k_{\ell-1}))`,
    then the algorithm recursively constructs pairs
    `(P_0, Q_0), (P_1, Q_1), \ldots, (P_\ell, Q_\ell)` of tableaux.
    The construction of `P_{t+1}` and `Q_{t+1}` from `P_t`, `Q_t`,
    `j_t` and `k_t` proceeds as follows: Set `i = j_t`, `x = k_t`,
    `P = P_t` and `Q = Q_t`. We are going to insert `x` into the
    increasing tableau `P` and update the set-valued "recording
    tableau" `Q` accordingly. As in the classical RSK algorithm, we
    first insert `x` into row `1` of `P`, then into row `2` of the
    resulting tableau, and so on, until the construction terminates.
    The details are different: Suppose we are inserting `x` into
    row `R` of `P`. If (Case 1) there exists an entry `y` in row `R`
    such that `x < y`, then let `y` be the minimal such entry. We
    replace this entry `y` with `x` if the result is still an
    increasing tableau; in either subcase, we then continue
    recursively, inserting `y` into the next row of `P`.
    If, on the other hand, (Case 2) no such `y` exists, then we
    append `x` to the end of `R` if the result is an increasing
    tableau (Subcase 2.1), and otherwise (Subcase 2.2) do nothing.
    Furthermore, in Subcase 2.1, we add the box that we have just
    filled with `x` in `P` to the shape of `Q`, and fill it with
    the one-element set `\{i\}`. In Subcase 2.2, we find the
    bottommost box of the column containing the rightmost box of
    row `R`, and add `i` to the entry of `Q` in this box (this
    entry is a set, since `Q` is a set-valued). In either
    subcase, we terminate the recursion, and set
    `P_{t+1} = P` and `Q_{t+1} = Q`.

    Notice that set-valued tableaux are encoded as tableaux whose
    entries are tuples of positive integers; each such tuple is strictly
    increasing and encodes a set (namely, the set of its entries).

    INPUT:

    - ``obj1, obj2`` -- Can be one of the following:

      - A word in an ordered alphabet
      - An integer matrix
      - Two lists of equal length representing a generalized permutation
      - Any object which has a method ``_rsk_iter()`` which returns an
        iterator over the object represented as generalized permutation or
        a pair of lists.

    - ``insertion`` -- (Default: ``'RSK'``) The following types of insertion
      are currently supported:

      - ``'RSK'`` -- Robinson-Schensted-Knuth
      - ``'EG'`` -- Edelman-Greene (only for reduced words of
        permutations/elements of a type-`A` Coxeter group)
      - ``'hecke'`` -- Hecke insertion (only guaranteed for
        generalized permutations whose top row is strictly increasing)

    - ``check_standard`` -- (Default: ``False``) Check if either of the
      resulting tableaux is a standard tableau, and if so, typecast it
      as such

    EXAMPLES:

    If we only give one line, we treat the top line as being
    `(1, 2, \ldots, n)`::

        sage: RSK([3,3,2,4,1])
        [[[1, 3, 4], [2], [3]], [[1, 2, 4], [3], [5]]]
        sage: RSK(Word([3,3,2,4,1]))
        [[[1, 3, 4], [2], [3]], [[1, 2, 4], [3], [5]]]
        sage: RSK(Word([2,3,3,2,1,3,2,3]))
        [[[1, 2, 2, 3, 3], [2, 3], [3]], [[1, 2, 3, 6, 8], [4, 7], [5]]]

    With a generalized permutation::

        sage: RSK([1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 2])
        [[[1, 1, 2], [2]], [[1, 2, 2], [2]]]
        sage: RSK(Word([1,1,3,4,4]), [1,4,2,1,3])
        [[[1, 1, 3], [2], [4]], [[1, 1, 4], [3], [4]]]
        sage: RSK([1,3,3,4,4], Word([6,2,2,1,7]))
        [[[1, 2, 7], [2], [6]], [[1, 3, 4], [3], [4]]]

    If we give it a matrix::

        sage: RSK(matrix([[0,1],[2,1]]))
        [[[1, 1, 2], [2]], [[1, 2, 2], [2]]]

    We can also give it something looking like a matrix::

        sage: RSK([[0,1],[2,1]])
        [[[1, 1, 2], [2]], [[1, 2, 2], [2]]]

    There are also variations of the insertion algorithm in RSK.
    Here we consider Edelman-Greene insertion::

        sage: RSK([2,1,2,3,2], insertion='EG')
        [[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3]], [[1, 3, 4], [2, 5]]]

    We reproduce figure 6.4 in [EG1987]_::

        sage: RSK([2,3,2,1,2,3], insertion='EG')
        [[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3], [3]], [[1, 2, 6], [3, 5], [4]]]

    Hecke insertion is also supported. We construct Example 2.1
    in :arxiv:`0801.1319v2`::

        sage: w = [5, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4]
        sage: RSK(w, insertion='hecke')
        [[[1, 2, 4, 5], [2, 4, 5], [3, 5], [4], [5]],
         [[(1,), (4,), (5,), (7,)],
          [(2,), (9,), (11, 13)],
          [(3,), (12,)],
          [(6,)],
          [(8, 10)]]]

    There is also :func:`~sage.combinat.rsk.RSK_inverse` which performs
    the inverse of the bijection on a pair of semistandard tableaux. We
    note that the inverse function takes 2 separate tableaux as inputs, so
    to compose with :func:`~sage.combinat.rsk.RSK`, we need to use the
    python ``*`` on the output::

        sage: RSK_inverse(*RSK([1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 2]))
        [[1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 2]]
        sage: P,Q = RSK([1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 2])
        sage: RSK_inverse(P, Q)
        [[1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 2]]

    Using Edelman-Greene insertion::

        sage: pq = RSK([2,1,2,3,2], insertion='EG'); pq
        [[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3]], [[1, 3, 4], [2, 5]]]
        sage: RSK_inverse(*pq, insertion='EG')

        sage: pq = RSK(w, insertion='hecke')

        [5, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4]

    .. NOTE::

        The constructor of ``Tableau`` accepts not only semistandard
        tableaux, but also arbitrary lists that are fillings of a
        partition diagram. (And such lists are used, e.g., for the
        set-valued tableau ``q`` that is passed to
        ``RSK_inverse(p, q, insertion='hecke')``.)
        The user is responsible for ensuring that the tableaux passed to
        ``RSK_inverse`` are of the right types (semistandard, standard,
        increasing, set-valued as needed).

    TESTS:

    From empty tableaux::

        sage: RSK_inverse(Tableau([]), Tableau([]))
        [[], []]

    Check that :func:`RSK_inverse` is the inverse of :func:`RSK` on the
    different types of inputs/outputs::

        sage: f = lambda p: RSK_inverse(*RSK(p), output='permutation')
        sage: all(p == f(p) for n in range(7) for p in Permutations(n))
        True
        sage: all(RSK_inverse(*RSK(w), output='word') == w for n in range(4) for w in Words(5, n))
        True
        sage: from sage.combinat.integer_matrices import IntegerMatrices
        sage: M = IntegerMatrices([1,2,2,1], [3,1,1,1])
        sage: all(RSK_inverse(*RSK(m), output='matrix') == m for m in M)
        True

        sage: n = ZZ.random_element(200)
        sage: p = Permutations(n).random_element()
        sage: is_fine = True if p == f(p) else p ; is_fine
        True

    Same for Edelman-Greene (but we are checking only the reduced words that
    can be obtained using the ``reduced_word()`` method from permutations)::

        sage: g = lambda w: RSK_inverse(*RSK(w, insertion='EG'), insertion='EG', output='permutation')
        sage: all(p.reduced_word() == g(p.reduced_word()) for n in range(7) for p in Permutations(n))
        True

        sage: n = ZZ.random_element(200)
        sage: p = Permutations(n).random_element()
        sage: is_fine = True if p == f(p) else p ; is_fine
        True

    Both tableaux must be of the same shape::
