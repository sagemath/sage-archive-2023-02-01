    The abstract algebra of non-commutative symmetric functions.

    We construct the abstract algebra of non-commutative symmetric
    functions over the rational numbers::

        sage: NCSF = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
        sage: NCSF
        Non-Commutative Symmetric Functions over the Rational Field
        sage: S = NCSF.complete()
        sage: R = NCSF.ribbon()
        sage: S[2,1]*R[1,2]
        S[2, 1, 1, 2] - S[2, 1, 3]

    NCSF is the unique free (non-commutative!) graded connected algebra with
    one generator in each degree::

        sage: NCSF.category()
        Join of Category of graded hopf algebras over Rational Field and Category of monoids with realizations and Category of coalgebras over Rational Field with realizations
        sage: [S[i].degree() for i in range(10)]
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    We use the Sage standard renaming idiom to get shorter outputs::

        sage: NCSF.rename("NCSF")
        sage: NCSF
        NCSF

    NCSF has many representations as a concrete algebra. Each of them
    has a distinguished basis, and its elements are expanded in this
    basis. Here is the Psi representation::

        sage: Psi = NCSF.Psi()
        sage: Psi
        NCSF in the Psi basis

    Elements of ``Psi`` are linear combinations of basis elements indexed
    by compositions::

      sage: Psi.an_element()
      2*Psi[] + 2*Psi[1] + 3*Psi[1, 1]

    The basis itself is accessible through::

        sage: Psi.basis()
        Lazy family (Term map from Compositions of non-negative integers...
        sage: Psi.basis().keys()
        Compositions of non-negative integers

    To construct an element one can therefore do::

        sage: Psi.basis()[Composition([2,1,3])]
        Psi[2, 1, 3]

    As this is rather cumbersome, the following abuses of notation are
    allowed::

        sage: Psi[Composition([2, 1, 3])]
        Psi[2, 1, 3]
        sage: Psi[[2, 1, 3]]
        Psi[2, 1, 3]
        sage: Psi[2, 1, 3]
        Psi[2, 1, 3]

    or even::

        sage: Psi[(i for i in [2, 1, 3])]
        Psi[2, 1, 3]

    Unfortunately, due to a limitation in Python syntax, one cannot use::

        sage: Psi[]       # not implemented

    Instead, you can use::

        sage: Psi[[]]
        Psi[]

    Now, we can construct linear combinations of basis elements::

        sage: Psi[2,1,3] + 2 * (Psi[4] + Psi[2,1])
        2*Psi[2, 1] + Psi[2, 1, 3] + 2*Psi[4]

    .. rubric:: Algebra structure

    To start with, ``Psi`` is a graded algebra, the grading being induced by
    the size of compositions. The one is the basis element indexed by the empty
    composition::

        sage: Psi.one()
        Psi[]
        sage: S.one()
        S[]
        sage: R.one()
        R[]

    As we have seen above, the ``Psi`` basis is multiplicative; that is
    multiplication is induced by linearity from the concatenation of
    compositions::

        sage: Psi[1,3] * Psi[2,1]
        Psi[1, 3, 2, 1]
        sage: (Psi.one() + 2 * Psi[1,3]) * Psi[2, 4]
        2*Psi[1, 3, 2, 4] + Psi[2, 4]

    .. rubric:: Hopf algebra structure

    ``Psi`` is further endowed with a coalgebra structure. The coproduct
    is an algebra morphism, and therefore determined by its values on
    the generators; those are primitive::

        sage: Psi[1].coproduct()
        Psi[] # Psi[1] + Psi[1] # Psi[]
        sage: Psi[2].coproduct()
        Psi[] # Psi[2] + Psi[2] # Psi[]

    The coproduct, being cocommutative on the generators, is
    cocommutative everywhere::

        sage: Psi[1,2].coproduct()
        Psi[] # Psi[1, 2] + Psi[1] # Psi[2] + Psi[1, 2] # Psi[] + Psi[2] # Psi[1]

    The algebra and coalgebra structures on ``Psi`` combine to form a
    bialgebra structure, which cooperates with the grading to form a
    connected graded bialgebra. Thus, as any connected graded bialgebra,
    ``Psi`` is a Hopf algebra. Over ``QQ`` (or any other `\QQ`-algebra),
    this Hopf algebra ``Psi`` is isomorphic to the tensor algebra of
    its space of primitive elements.

    The antipode is an anti-algebra morphism; in the ``Psi`` basis, it
    sends the generators to their opposites and changes their sign if
    they are of odd degree::

        sage: Psi[3].antipode()
        -Psi[3]
        sage: Psi[1,3,2].antipode()
        -Psi[2, 3, 1]
        sage: Psi[1,3,2].coproduct().apply_multilinear_morphism(lambda be,ga: Psi(be)*Psi(ga).antipode())
        0

    The counit is defined by sending all elements of positive degree to
    zero::

        sage: S[3].degree(), S[3,1,2].degree(), S.one().degree()
        (3, 6, 0)
        sage: S[3].counit()
        0
        sage: S[3,1,2].counit()
        0
        sage: S.one().counit()
        1
        sage: (S[3] - 2*S[3,1,2] + 7).counit()
        7
        sage: (R[3] - 2*R[3,1,2] + 7).counit()
        7

    .. rubric:: Other concrete representations

    .. TODO:: demonstrate how to customize the basis names

    NCSF admits many other concrete realizations::

        sage: Phi        = NCSF.Phi()
        sage: ribbon     = NCSF.ribbon()
        sage: complete   = NCSF.complete()
        sage: elementary = NCSF.elementary()
        sage: monomial   = NCSF.monomial()

    To change from one basis to another, one simply does::

        sage: Phi(Psi[1])
        Phi[1]
        sage: Phi(Psi[3])
        -1/4*Phi[1, 2] + 1/4*Phi[2, 1] + Phi[3]

    In general, one can mix up different bases in computations::

        sage: Phi[1] * Psi[1]
        Phi[1, 1]

    Some of the changes of basis are easy to guess::

        sage: ribbon(complete[1,3,2])
        R[1, 3, 2] + R[1, 5] + R[4, 2] + R[6]

    This is the sum of all fatter compositions. Using the usual
    Moebius function for the boolean lattice, the inverse change of
    basis is given by the alternating sum of all fatter compositions::

        sage: complete(ribbon[1,3,2])
        S[1, 3, 2] - S[1, 5] - S[4, 2] + S[6]

    The analogue of the elementary basis is the sum over
    all finer compositions than the 'complement' of the composition
    in the ribbon basis::

        sage: Composition([1,3,2]).complement()
        [2, 1, 2, 1]
        sage: ribbon(elementary([1,3,2]))
        R[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + R[1, 1, 1, 2, 1] + R[2, 1, 1, 1, 1] + R[2, 1, 2, 1]

    By Moebius inversion on the composition poset, the ribbon
    basis element corresponding to a composition `I` is then the
    alternating sum over all compositions fatter than the
    complement composition of `I` in the elementary basis::

        sage: elementary(ribbon[2,1,2,1])
        L[1, 3, 2] - L[1, 5] - L[4, 2] + L[6]

    .. TODO:: explain the other changes of bases!

    Here is how to fetch the conversion morphisms::

        sage: f = complete.coerce_map_from(elementary); f
        Generic morphism:
          From: NCSF in the Elementary basis
          To:   NCSF in the Complete basis
        sage: g = elementary.coerce_map_from(complete); g
        Generic morphism:
          From: NCSF in the Complete basis
          To:   NCSF in the Elementary basis
        sage: f.category()
        Category of hom sets in Category of modules with basis over Rational Field
        sage: f(elementary[1,2,2])
        S[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - S[1, 1, 1, 2] - S[1, 2, 1, 1] + S[1, 2, 2]
        sage: g(complete[1,2,2])
        L[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - L[1, 1, 1, 2] - L[1, 2, 1, 1] + L[1, 2, 2]
        sage: h = f*g; h
        Composite map:
          From: NCSF in the Complete basis
          To:   NCSF in the Complete basis
          Defn:   Generic morphism:
                  From: NCSF in the Complete basis
                  To:   NCSF in the Elementary basis
                then
                  Generic morphism:
                  From: NCSF in the Elementary basis
                  To:   NCSF in the Complete basis
        sage: h(complete[1,3,2])

                Return the image of the noncommutative symmetric function
                ``self`` under the `n`-th Verschiebung operator.

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is defined
                to be the map from the `\mathbf{k}`-algebra of noncommutative
                symmetric functions to itself that sends the complete function
                `S^I` indexed by a composition `I = (i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k)`

                `i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k` are divisible by `n`, and to `0`
                otherwise. This operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is a Hopf algebra
                endomorphism. For every positive integer `r` with `n \mid r`,
                it satisfies

                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Phi_r) = n \Phi_{r/n}

                (where `S_r` denotes the `r`-th complete non-commutative
                symmetric function, `\Lambda_r` denotes the `r`-th elementary
                non-commutative symmetric function, `\Psi_r` denotes the `r`-th
                power-sum non-commutative symmetric function of the first kind,
                and `\Phi_r` denotes the `r`-th power-sum non-commutative
                symmetric function of the second kind). For every positive
                integer `r` with `n \nmid r`, it satisfes

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator is also called the `n`-th
                Verschiebung endomorphism.

                It is a lift of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator on the ring
                of symmetric functions (
                :meth:`sage.combinat.sf.sfa.SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic_Element.verschiebung`
                ) to the ring of noncommutative symmetric functions.

                The action of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator can also be
                described on the ribbon Schur functions. Namely, every
                composition `I` of size `n \ell` satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n ( R_I )
                    = (-1)^{\ell(I) - \ell(J)} \cdot R_{J / n},

                where `J` denotes the meet of the compositions `I` and
                `(\underbrace{n, n, \ldots, n}_{|I|/n \mbox{ times}})`,
                where `\ell(I)` is the length of `I`, and
                where `J / n` denotes the composition obtained by dividing
                every entry of `J` by `n`.
                For a composition `I` of size not divisible by `n`, we have
                `\mathbf{V}_n( R_I ) = 0`.

                Return the image of the noncommutative symmetric function
                ``self`` under the star involution.

                The star involution is defined as the algebra antihomomorphism
                `NCSF \to NCSF` which, for every positive integer `n`, sends
                the `n`-th complete non-commutative symmetric function `S_n` to
                `S_n`. Denoting by `f^{\ast}` the image of an element
                `f \in NCSF` under this star involution, it can be shown that
                every composition `I` satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    (S^I)^{\ast} = S^{I^r}, \quad
                    (\Lambda^I)^{\ast} = \Lambda^{I^r}, \quad

                    (\Phi^I)^{\ast} = \Phi^{I^r},

                where `I^r` denotes the reversed composition of `I`, and
                standard notations for classical bases of `NCSF` are being used
                (`S` for the complete basis, `\Lambda` for the elementary basis,
                `R` for the ribbon basis, and `\Phi` for that of the power-sums
                of the second kind). The star involution is an involution and a
                coalgebra automorphism of `NCSF`. It is an automorphism of the
                graded vector space `NCSF`. Under the canonical isomorphism
                between the `n`-th graded component of `NCSF` and the descent
                algebra of the symmetric group `S_n` (see
                :meth:`to_descent_algebra`), the star involution (restricted to
                the `n`-th graded component) corresponds to the automorphism
                of the descent algebra given by
                `x \mapsto \omega_n x \omega_n`, where `\omega_n` is the
                permutation `(n, n-1, \ldots, 1) \in S_n` (written here in
                one-line notation). If `\pi` denotes the projection from `NCSF`
                to the ring of symmetric functions
                (:meth:`to_symmetric_function`), then `\pi(f^{\ast}) = \pi(f)`
                for every `f \in NCSF`.

                The star involution on `NCSF` is adjoint to the star involution
                on `QSym` by the standard adjunction between `NCSF` and `QSym`.

                The star involution has been denoted by `\rho` in [LMvW13]_,

                The involution `\psi` of `NCSF` is adjoint to the involution
                `\psi` of `QSym` by the standard adjunction between `NCSF` and

                Return the left-padded Kronecker product of ``self`` and
                ``x`` in the basis of ``self``.

                The left-padded Kronecker product is a bilinear map
                mapping two non-commutative symmetric functions to
                another, not necessarily preserving degree.
                It can be defined as follows: Let `*` denote the internal
                product (:meth:`internal_product`) on the space of
                non-commutative symmetric functions. For any composition
                `I`, let `S^I` denote the complete homogeneous symmetric
                function indexed by `I`. For any compositions
                `\alpha`, `\beta`, `\gamma`, let
                `g^{\gamma}_{\alpha, \beta}` denote the coefficient of
                `S^{\gamma}` in the internal product
                `S^{\alpha} * S^{\beta}`.
                For every composition `I = (i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)`
                and every integer `n > \left\lvert I \right\rvert`, define the
                *`n`-completion of `I`* to be the composition
                `(n - \left\lvert I \right\rvert, i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)`;
                this `n`-completion is denoted by `I[n]`.
                Then, for any compositions `\alpha` and `\beta` and every
                integer `n > \left\lvert \alpha \right\rvert
                + \left\lvert\beta\right\rvert`, we can write the
                internal product `S^{\alpha[n]} * S^{\beta[n]}` in the form

                .. MATH::

                    S^{\alpha[n]} * S^{\beta[n]} =
                    \sum_{\gamma} g^{\gamma[n]}_{\alpha[n], \beta[n]}
                    S^{\gamma[n]}

                with `\gamma` ranging over all compositions. The
                coefficients `g^{\gamma[n]}_{\alpha[n], \beta[n]}`
                are independent on `n`. These coefficients
                `g^{\gamma[n]}_{\alpha[n], \beta[n]}` are denoted by
                `\widetilde{g}^{\gamma}_{\alpha, \beta}`, and the
                non-commutative symmetric function

                .. MATH::

                    \sum_{\gamma} \widetilde{g}^{\gamma}_{\alpha, \beta}
                    S^{\gamma}

                is said to be the *left-padded Kronecker product* of
                `S^{\alpha}` and `S^{\beta}`. By bilinearity, this
                extends to a definition of a left-padded Kronecker product
                of any two non-commutative symmetric functions.

                The left-padded Kronecker product on the non-commutative
                symmetric functions lifts the left-padded Kronecker
                product on the symmetric functions. More precisely: Let
                `\pi` denote the canonical projection
                (:meth:`to_symmetric_function`) from the non-commutative
                symmetric functions to the symmetric functions. Then, any
                two non-commutative symmetric functions `f` and `g`
                satisfy

                .. MATH::

                    \pi(f \overline{*} g) = \pi(f) \overline{*} \pi(g),

                where the `\overline{*}` on the left-hand side denotes the
                left-padded Kronecker product on the non-commutative
                symmetric functions, and the `\overline{*}` on the
                right-hand side denotes the left-padded Kronecker product
                on the symmetric functions.

                INPUT:

                - ``x`` -- element of the ring of non-commutative
                  symmetric functions over the same base ring as ``self``

                - the left-padded Kronecker product of ``self`` with ``x``
                  (an element of the ring of non-commutative symmetric
                  functions in the same basis as ``self``)

                Taking the left-padded Kronecker product with
                `1 = S^{\empty}` is the identity map on the ring of

                    ....:      for lam in Compositions(i) )
                    True

                Here is a rule for the left-padded Kronecker product of
                `S_1` (this is the same as `S^{(1)}`) with any complete
                homogeneous function: Let `I` be a composition.
                Then, the left-padded Kronecker product of `S_1` and
                `S^I` is `\sum_K a_K S^K`, where the sum runs
                over all compositions `K`, and the coefficient `a_K` is
                defined as the number of ways to obtain `K` from `I` by
                one of the following two operations:

                - Insert a `1` at the end of `I`.
                - Subtract `1` from one of the entries of `I` (and remove
                  the entry if it thus becomes `0`), and insert a `1` at
                  the end of `I`.

                We check this for compositions of size `\leq 4`::

                    ....:     # Left left-padded Kronecker multiplication by S[1].

                    True

                A similar rule can be made for the left-padded Kronecker
                product of any complete homogeneous function with `S_1`:
                Let `I` be a composition. Then, the left-padded Kronecker
                product of `S^I` and `S_1` is `\sum_K b_K S^K`, where the
                sum runs over all compositions `K`, and the coefficient
                `b_K` is defined as the number of ways to obtain `K` from
                `I` by one of the following two operations:

                - Insert a `1` at the front of `I`.
                - Subtract `1` from one of the entries of `I` (and remove
                  the entry if it thus becomes `0`), and insert a `1`
                  right after this entry.

                ``self`` under the `n`-th Verschiebung operator.

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is defined
                to be the map from the `\mathbf{k}`-algebra of noncommutative
                symmetric functions to itself that sends the complete function
                `S^I` indexed by a composition `I = (i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k)`

                `i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k` are divisible by `n`, and to `0`
                otherwise. This operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is a Hopf algebra
                endomorphism. For every positive integer `r` with `n \mid r`,
                it satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n(S_r) = S_{r/n},

                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Phi_r) = n \Phi_{r/n}

                (where `S_r` denotes the `r`-th complete non-commutative
                symmetric function, `\Lambda_r` denotes the `r`-th elementary
                non-commutative symmetric function, `\Psi_r` denotes the `r`-th
                power-sum non-commutative symmetric function of the first kind,
                and `\Phi_r` denotes the `r`-th power-sum non-commutative
                symmetric function of the second kind). For every positive
                integer `r` with `n \nmid r`, it satisfes

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator is also called the `n`-th
                Verschiebung endomorphism.

                It is a lift of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator on the ring
                of symmetric functions (
                :meth:`sage.combinat.sf.sfa.SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic_Element.verschiebung`
                ) to the ring of noncommutative symmetric functions.

                The action of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator can also be
                described on the ribbon Schur functions. Namely, every
                composition `I` of size `n \ell` satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n ( R_I )
                    = (-1)^{\ell(I) - \ell(J)} \cdot R_{J / n},

                where `J` denotes the meet of the compositions `I` and
                `(\underbrace{n, n, \ldots, n}_{|I|/n \mbox{ times}})`,
                where `\ell(I)` is the length of `I`, and
                where `J / n` denotes the composition obtained by
                dividing every entry of `J` by `n`.
                For a composition `I` of size not divisible by `n`, we
                have `\mathbf{V}_n ( R_I ) = 0`.

                `NCSF \to NCSF` which, for every positive integer `n`, sends
                the `n`-th complete non-commutative symmetric function `S_n` to

                every composition `I` satisfies

                where `I^r` denotes the reversed composition of `I`, and

                `R` for the ribbon basis, and `\Phi` for that of the power-sums
                of the second kind). The star involution is an involution and a
                coalgebra automorphism of `NCSF`. It is an automorphism of the
                graded vector space `NCSF`. Under the canonical isomorphism
                between the `n`-th graded component of `NCSF` and the descent
                algebra of the symmetric group `S_n` (see
                :meth:`to_descent_algebra`), the star involution (restricted to
                the `n`-th graded component) corresponds to the automorphism
                of the descent algebra given by
                `x \mapsto \omega_n x \omega_n`, where `\omega_n` is the
                permutation `(n, n-1, \ldots, 1) \in S_n` (written here in
                one-line notation). If `\pi` denotes the projection from `NCSF`
                to the ring of symmetric functions

                The star involution on `NCSF` is adjoint to the star involution
                on `QSym` by the standard adjunction between `NCSF` and `QSym`.

                The star involution has been denoted by `\rho` in [LMvW13]_,

                Return the image of the noncommutative symmetric function
                ``self`` under the `n`-th Verschiebung operator.

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is defined
                to be the map from the `\mathbf{k}`-algebra of noncommutative
                symmetric functions to itself that sends the complete function
                `S^I` indexed by a composition `I = (i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k)`
                to `S^{(i_1/n, i_2/n, \ldots , i_k/n)}` if all of the numbers
                `i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k` are divisible by `n`, and to `0`
                otherwise. This operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is a Hopf algebra
                endomorphism. For every positive integer `r` with `n \mid r`,
                it satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n(S_r) = S_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Lambda_r) = (-1)^{r - r/n} \Lambda_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Psi_r) = n \Psi_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Phi_r) = n \Phi_{r/n}

                (where `S_r` denotes the `r`-th complete non-commutative
                symmetric function, `\Lambda_r` denotes the `r`-th elementary
                non-commutative symmetric function, `\Psi_r` denotes the `r`-th
                power-sum non-commutative symmetric function of the first kind,
                and `\Phi_r` denotes the `r`-th power-sum non-commutative
                symmetric function of the second kind). For every positive
                integer `r` with `n \nmid r`, it satisfes

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator is also called the `n`-th
                Verschiebung endomorphism.

                It is a lift of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator on the ring
                of symmetric functions (
                :meth:`sage.combinat.sf.sfa.SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic_Element.verschiebung`
                ) to the ring of noncommutative symmetric functions.

                The action of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator can also be
                described on the ribbon Schur functions. Namely, every
                composition `I` of size `n \ell` satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n ( R_I )
                    = (-1)^{\ell(I) - \ell(J)} \cdot R_{J / n},

                where `J` denotes the meet of the compositions `I` and
                `(\underbrace{n, n, \ldots, n}_{|I|/n \mbox{ times}})`,
                where `\ell(I)` is the length of `I`, and
                where `J / n` denotes the composition obtained by
                dividing every entry of `J` by `n`.
                For a composition `I` of size not divisible by `n`, we
                have `\mathbf{V}_n ( R_I ) = 0`.

                `NCSF \to NCSF` which, for every positive integer `n`, sends

                every composition `I` satisfies

                `R` for the ribbon basis, and `\Phi` for that of the power-sums
                of the second kind). The star involution is an involution and a
                coalgebra automorphism of `NCSF`. It is an automorphism of the

                between the `n`-th graded component of `NCSF` and the descent
                algebra of the symmetric group `S_n` (see

                the `n`-th graded component) corresponds to the automorphism
                of the descent algebra given by
                `x \mapsto \omega_n x \omega_n`, where `\omega_n` is the
                permutation `(n, n-1, \ldots, 1) \in S_n` (written here in

                on `QSym` by the standard adjunction between `NCSF` and `QSym`.

        r"""
        The Hopf algebra of non-commutative symmetric functions in the
        Psi basis.

        The Psi basis is defined in Definition 3.4 of [NCSF1]_, where
        it is denoted by `(\Psi^I)_I`. It is a multiplicative basis, and
        is connected to the elementary generators `\Lambda_i` of the ring
        of non-commutative symmetric functions by the following relation:
        Define a non-commutative symmetric function `\Psi_n` for every
        positive integer `n` by the power series identity

        .. MATH::

            \frac{d}{dt} \sigma(t)
            = \sigma(t) \cdot \left( \sum_{k \geq 1} t^{k-1} \Psi_k \right),

        where

        .. MATH::

            \sigma(t) = \left( \sum_{k \geq 0} (-t)^k \Lambda_k \right)^{-1}

        and where `\Lambda_0` denotes `1`. For every composition
        `(i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)`, we have
        `\Psi^{(i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)}
        = \Psi_{i_1} \Psi_{i_2} \cdots \Psi_{i_k}`.

        The `\Psi`-basis is a basis only when the base ring is a
        `\QQ`-algebra (although the `\Psi^I` can be defined over any base
        ring). The elements of the `\Psi`-basis are known as the
        "power-sum non-commutative symmetric functions of the first kind".
        The generators `\Psi_n` correspond to the Dynkin
        (quasi-)idempotents in the descent algebras of the symmetric
        groups (see [NCSF1]_, 5.2 for details).

        Another (equivalent) definition of `\Psi_n` is

        .. MATH::

            \Psi_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (-1)^i R_{1^i, n-i},

        where `R` denotes the ribbon basis of `NCSF`, and where `1^i`
        stands for `i` repetitions of the integer `1`.

                Return the image of the noncommutative symmetric function
                ``self`` under the `n`-th Verschiebung operator.

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is defined
                to be the map from the `\mathbf{k}`-algebra of noncommutative
                symmetric functions to itself that sends the complete function
                `S^I` indexed by a composition `I = (i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k)`
                to `S^{(i_1/n, i_2/n, \ldots , i_k/n)}` if all of the numbers
                `i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k` are divisible by `n`, and to `0`
                otherwise. This operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is a Hopf algebra
                endomorphism. For every positive integer `r` with `n \mid r`,
                it satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n(S_r) = S_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Lambda_r) = (-1)^{r - r/n} \Lambda_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Psi_r) = n \Psi_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Phi_r) = n \Phi_{r/n}

                (where `S_r` denotes the `r`-th complete non-commutative
                symmetric function, `\Lambda_r` denotes the `r`-th elementary
                non-commutative symmetric function, `\Psi_r` denotes the `r`-th
                power-sum non-commutative symmetric function of the first kind,
                and `\Phi_r` denotes the `r`-th power-sum non-commutative
                symmetric function of the second kind). For every positive
                integer `r` with `n \nmid r`, it satisfes

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n(S_r) = \mathbf{V}_n(\Lambda_r)
                    = \mathbf{V}_n(\Psi_r) = \mathbf{V}_n(\Phi_r) = 0.

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator is also called the `n`-th
                Verschiebung endomorphism.

                It is a lift of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator on the ring
                of symmetric functions (
                :meth:`sage.combinat.sf.sfa.SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic_Element.verschiebung`
                ) to the ring of noncommutative symmetric functions.

                The action of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator can also be
                described on the ribbon Schur functions. Namely, every
                composition `I` of size `n \ell` satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n ( R_I )
                    = (-1)^{\ell(I) - \ell(J)} \cdot R_{J / n},

                where `J` denotes the meet of the compositions `I` and
                `(\underbrace{n, n, \ldots, n}_{|I|/n \mbox{ times}})`,
                where `\ell(I)` is the length of `I`, and
                where `J / n` denotes the composition obtained by
                dividing every entry of `J` by `n`.
                For a composition `I` of size not divisible by `n`, we
                have `\mathbf{V}_n ( R_I ) = 0`.

        The Hopf algebra of non-commutative symmetric functions in the
        Phi basis.

        The Phi basis is defined in Definition 3.4 of [NCSF1]_, where
        it is denoted by `(\Phi^I)_I`. It is a multiplicative basis, and
        is connected to the elementary generators `\Lambda_i` of the ring
        of non-commutative symmetric functions by the following relation:
        Define a non-commutative symmetric function `\Phi_n` for every
        positive integer `n` by the power series identity

        .. MATH::

            \sum_{k\geq 1} t^k \frac{1}{k} \Phi_k
            = -\log \left( \sum_{k \geq 0} (-t)^k \Lambda_k \right),

        with `\Lambda_0` denoting `1`. For every composition
        `(i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)`, we have
        `\Phi^{(i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)}
        = \Phi_{i_1} \Phi_{i_2} \cdots \Phi_{i_k}`.

        The `\Phi`-basis is well-defined only when the base ring is a
        `\QQ`-algebra. The elements of the `\Phi`-basis are known as the
        "power-sum non-commutative symmetric functions of the second
        kind".

        The generators `\Phi_n` are related to the (first) Eulerian
        idempotents in the descent algebras of the symmetric groups (see
        [NCSF1]_, 5.4 for details).

                Return the image of the noncommutative symmetric function
                ``self`` under the `n`-th Verschiebung operator.

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is defined
                to be the map from the `\mathbf{k}`-algebra of noncommutative
                symmetric functions to itself that sends the complete function
                `S^I` indexed by a composition `I = (i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_k)`
                to `S^{(i_1/n, i_2/n, \ldots , i_k/n)}` if all of the numbers
                `i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k` are divisible by `n`, and to `0`
                otherwise. This operator `\mathbf{V}_n` is a Hopf algebra
                endomorphism. For every positive integer `r` with `n \mid r`,
                it satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n(S_r) = S_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Lambda_r) = (-1)^{r - r/n} \Lambda_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Psi_r) = n \Psi_{r/n},
                    \quad \mathbf{V}_n(\Phi_r) = n \Phi_{r/n}

                (where `S_r` denotes the `r`-th complete non-commutative
                symmetric function, `\Lambda_r` denotes the `r`-th elementary
                non-commutative symmetric function, `\Psi_r` denotes the `r`-th
                power-sum non-commutative symmetric function of the first kind,
                and `\Phi_r` denotes the `r`-th power-sum non-commutative
                symmetric function of the second kind). For every positive
                integer `r` with `n \nmid r`, it satisfes

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n(S_r) = \mathbf{V}_n(\Lambda_r)
                    = \mathbf{V}_n(\Psi_r) = \mathbf{V}_n(\Phi_r) = 0.

                The `n`-th Verschiebung operator is also called the `n`-th
                Verschiebung endomorphism.

                It is a lift of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator on the ring
                of symmetric functions (
                :meth:`sage.combinat.sf.sfa.SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic_Element.verschiebung`
                ) to the ring of noncommutative symmetric functions.

                The action of the `n`-th Verschiebung operator can also be
                described on the ribbon Schur functions. Namely, every
                composition `I` of size `n \ell` satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    \mathbf{V}_n ( R_I )
                    = (-1)^{\ell(I) - \ell(J)} \cdot R_{J / n},

                where `J` denotes the meet of the compositions `I` and
                `(\underbrace{n, n, \ldots, n}_{|I|/n \mbox{ times}})`,
                where `\ell(I)` is the length of `I`, and
                where `J / n` denotes the composition obtained by
                dividing every entry of `J` by `n`.
                For a composition `I` of size not divisible by `n`, we
                have `\mathbf{V}_n ( R_I ) = 0`.

                Return the image of the noncommutative symmetric function
                ``self`` under the star involution.

                The star involution is defined as the algebra antihomomorphism
                `NCSF \to NCSF` which, for every positive integer `n`, sends
                the `n`-th complete non-commutative symmetric function `S_n` to
                `S_n`. Denoting by `f^{\ast}` the image of an element
                `f \in NCSF` under this star involution, it can be shown that
                every composition `I` satisfies

                .. MATH::

                    (S^I)^{\ast} = S^{I^r}, \quad

                where `I^r` denotes the reversed composition of `I`, and
                standard notations for classical bases of `NCSF` are being used
                (`S` for the complete basis, `\Lambda` for the elementary basis,
                `R` for the ribbon basis, and `\Phi` for that of the power-sums
                of the second kind). The star involution is an involution and a
                coalgebra automorphism of `NCSF`. It is an automorphism of the
                graded vector space `NCSF`. Under the canonical isomorphism
                between the `n`-th graded component of `NCSF` and the descent
                algebra of the symmetric group `S_n` (see
                :meth:`to_descent_algebra`), the star involution (restricted to
                the `n`-th graded component) corresponds to the automorphism
                of the descent algebra given by
                `x \mapsto \omega_n x \omega_n`, where `\omega_n` is the
                permutation `(n, n-1, \ldots, 1) \in S_n` (written here in
                one-line notation). If `\pi` denotes the projection from `NCSF`
                to the ring of symmetric functions
                (:meth:`to_symmetric_function`), then `\pi(f^{\ast}) = \pi(f)`
                for every `f \in NCSF`.

                The star involution on `NCSF` is adjoint to the star involution
                on `QSym` by the standard adjunction between `NCSF` and `QSym`.

                The star involution has been denoted by `\rho` in [LMvW13]_,
                section 3.6.
                See [NCSF2]_, section 2.3 for the properties of this map.

            The immaculate basis of the non-commutative symmetric
            functions. This basis first appears in Berg, Bergeron,
            Saliola, Serrano and Zabrocki's [BBSSZ2012]_. It can be
            described as the family `(\mathfrak{S}_{\alpha})`, where
            `\alpha` runs over all compositions, and
            `\mathfrak{S}_{\alpha}` denotes the immaculate function
            corresponding to `\alpha` (see
            :meth:`~sage.combinat.ncsf_qsym.ncsf.NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions.Bases.ParentMethods.immaculate_function`).

            .. WARNING::

                This *basis* contains only the immaculate functions
                indexed by compositions (i.e., finite sequences of
                positive integers). To obtain the remaining immaculate
                functions (sensu lato), use the
                :meth:`~sage.combinat.ncsf_qsym.ncsf.NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions.Bases.ParentMethods.immaculate_function`
                method. Calling the immaculate *basis* with a list
                which is not a composition will currently return
                garbage!
