#From John Jones
#Hi William,

#The problem was in the script newest_version.  It has a command
#"cd standard" and cd, at least in this version of bash, outputs the
#new directory path to the standard output.  The directory was then
#passed as part of the output of newest_version, and so it was being
#captured as part of the environment variable values in spkg/install,
#which in turn caused problems for the makefile deps.

#To fix it, I changed the line to be "cd standard >& /dev/null", and
#now it is building.
