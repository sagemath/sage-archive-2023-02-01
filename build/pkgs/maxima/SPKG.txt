== Description ==

Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical
expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series,
Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear
equations, polynomials, and sets, lists, vectors, matrices, and
tensors. Maxima yields high precision numeric results by using exact
fractions, arbitrary precision integers, and variable precision
floating point numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in two and
three dimensions.
