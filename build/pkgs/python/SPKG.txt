== Description ==

Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries, and can be learned in a few days. Many Python programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the language encourages the development of higher quality, more maintainable code.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Remove src/Lib/distutils/command/wininst-6.exe and src/Lib/distutils/command/wininst-7.1.exe. Once we support Windows we will likely need to add them back in.
 * We used to block parallel MAKE, but extensive testing [make -j64] showed that there is no longer any problem. The problem was the a parallel make install causes trouble
 * Patch ctypes__init__.patch: Disable pre-Python 2.5 problem workaround on OSX.
 * Patch locale.py: Work around import failures for locals
 * Patch pkgutil.patch: Make Python's help command work in Sage, work around failures for locals.
 * Patch python-pymactoolbox.h-64bit-osx.patch: disable OSX specific glue code due to issues with twisted if they exist
 * Patch readline-Itanium-fix.patch: Fix Itanium specific readline extension problem.
