This module defines a class of abstract finite cell complexes.  This
is meant as a base class from which other classes (like
:class:`~sage.homology.simplicial_complex.SimplicialComplex`,
:class:`~sage.homology.cubical_complex.CubicalComplex`, and
:class:`~sage.homology.delta_complex.DeltaComplex`) should derive.  As
such, most of its properties are not implemented.  It is meant for use
by developers producing new classes, not casual users.

.. NOTE::

    Keywords for :meth:`~GenericCellComplex.chain_complex`,
    :meth:`~GenericCellComplex.homology`, etc.: any keywords given to
    the :meth:`~GenericCellComplex.homology` method get passed on to
    the :meth:`~GenericCellComplex.chain_complex` method and also to
    the constructor for chain complexes in
    :class:`sage.homology.chain_complex.ChainComplex_class <ChainComplex>`,
    as well as its associated
    :meth:`~sage.homology.chain_complex.ChainComplex_class.homology` method.
    This means that those keywords should have consistent meaning in
    all of those situations.  It also means that it is easy to
    implement new keywords: for example, if you implement a new
    keyword for the
    :meth:`sage.homology.chain_complex.ChainComplex_class.homology` method,
    then it will be automatically accessible through the
    :meth:`~GenericCellComplex.homology` method for cell complexes --
    just make sure it gets documented.

    Class of abstract cell complexes.

    This is meant to be used by developers to produce new classes, not
    by casual users.  Classes which derive from this are
    :class:`~sage.homology.simplicial_complex.SimplicialComplex`,
    :class:`~sage.homology.delta_complex.DeltaComplex`, and
    :class:`~sage.homology.cubical_complex.CubicalComplex`.

    Most of the methods here are not implemented, but probably should
    be implemented in a derived class.  Most of the other methods call
    a non-implemented one; their docstrings contain examples from
    derived classes in which the various methods have been defined.
    For example, :meth:`homology` calls :meth:`chain_complex`; the
    class :class:`~sage.homology.delta_complex.DeltaComplex`
    implements
    :meth:`~sage.homology.delta_complex.DeltaComplex.chain_complex`,
    and so the :meth:`homology` method here is illustrated with
    examples involving `\Delta`-complexes.

    EXAMPLES:

    It's hard to give informative examples of the base class, since
    essentially nothing is implemented. ::

        .. note::

            The keyword arguments to this function get passed on to
            :meth:``chain_complex`` and its homology.

        ALGORITHM:

        If ``algorithm`` is set to 'auto' (the default), then use
        CHomP if available.  (CHomP is available at the web page
        http://chomp.rutgers.edu/.  It is also an experimental package
        for Sage.)

        CHomP computes homology, not cohomology, and only works over
        the integers or finite prime fields.  Therefore if any of
        these conditions fails, or if CHomP is not present, or if
        ``algorithm`` is set to 'no_chomp', go to plan B: if ``self``
        has a ``_homology`` method -- each simplicial complex has
        this, for example -- then call that.  Such a method implements
        specialized algorithms for the particular type of cell
        complex.

        Otherwise, move on to plan C: compute the chain complex of
        ``self`` and compute its homology groups.  To do this: over a
        field, just compute ranks and nullities, thus obtaining
        dimensions of the homology groups as vector spaces.  Over the
        integers, compute Smith normal form of the boundary matrices
        defining the chain complex according to the value of
        ``algorithm``.  If ``algorithm`` is 'auto' or 'no_chomp', then
        for each relatively small matrix, use the standard Sage
        method, which calls the Pari package.  For any large matrix,
        reduce it using the Dumas, Heckenbach, Saunders, and Welker
        elimination algorithm: see
        :func:`sage.homology.matrix_utils.dhsw_snf` for details.

        Finally, ``algorithm`` may also be 'pari' or 'dhsw', which
        forces the named algorithm to be used regardless of the size
        of the matrices and regardless of whether CHomP is available.

        As of this writing, CHomP is by far the fastest option,
        followed by the 'auto' or 'no_chomp' setting of using the
        Dumas, Heckenbach, Saunders, and Welker elimination algorithm
        for large matrices and Pari for small ones.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: P = delta_complexes.RealProjectivePlane()
            sage: P.homology()
            {0: 0, 1: C2, 2: 0}
            sage: P.homology(base_ring=GF(2))
            {0: Vector space of dimension 0 over Finite Field of size 2,
             1: Vector space of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2,
             2: Vector space of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2}
            sage: S7 = delta_complexes.Sphere(7)
            sage: S7.homology(7)
            Z
            sage: cubical_complexes.KleinBottle().homology(1, base_ring=GF(2))
            Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field of size 2

        If CHomP is installed, Sage can compute generators of homology
        groups::

            sage: S2 = simplicial_complexes.Sphere(2)
            sage: S2.homology(dim=2, generators=True, base_ring=GF(2))  # optional - CHomP
            (Vector space of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 2, [(0, 1, 2) + (0, 1, 3) + (0, 2, 3) + (1, 2, 3)])

        When generators are computed, Sage returns a pair for each
        dimension: the group and the list of generators.  For
        simplicial complexes, each generator is represented as a
        linear combination of simplices, as above, and for cubical
        complexes, each generator is a linear combination of cubes::

            sage: S2_cub = cubical_complexes.Sphere(2)
            sage: S2_cub.homology(dim=2, generators=True)  # optional - CHomP
