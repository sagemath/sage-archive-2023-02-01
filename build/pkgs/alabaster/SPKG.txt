== Description ==

Alabaster is a visually (c)lean, responsive, configurable theme for the Sphinx
documentation system. It is Python 2+3 compatible.

It began as a third-party theme, and is still maintained separately, but as of
Sphinx 1.3, Alabaster is an install-time dependency of Sphinx and is selected
as the default theme.

Live examples of this theme can be seen on paramiko.org, fabfile.org and
pyinvoke.org.
