    A partition of a set.

    A set partition `p` of a set `S` is a partition of `S` into subsets
    called parts and represented as a set of sets. By extension, a set
    partition of a nonnegative integer `n` is the set partition of the
    integers from 1 to `n`. The number of set partitions of `n` is called
    the `n`-th Bell number.

    There is a natural integer partition associated with a set partition,
    namely the nonincreasing sequence of sizes of all its parts.

    There is a classical lattice associated with all set partitions of
    `n`. The infimum of two set partitions is the set partition obtained
    by intersecting all the parts of both set partitions. The supremum
    is obtained by transitive closure of the relation `i` related to `j`
    if and only if they are in the same part in at least one of the set
    partitions.

    We will use terminology from partitions, in particular the *length* of
    a set partition `A = \{A_1, \ldots, A_k\}` is the number of parts of `A`
    and is denoted by `|A| := k`. The *size* of `A` is the cardinality of `S`.
    We will also sometimes use the notation `[n] := \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}`.

    EXAMPLES:

    There are 5 set partitions of the set `\{1,2,3\}`::

        sage: SetPartitions(3).cardinality()
        5

    Here is the list of them::

        sage: SetPartitions(3).list()
        [{{1, 2, 3}},
         {{1}, {2, 3}},
         {{1, 3}, {2}},
         {{1, 2}, {3}},
         {{1}, {2}, {3}}]

    There are 6 set partitions of `\{1,2,3,4\}` whose underlying partition is
    `[2, 1, 1]`::

        sage: SetPartitions(4, [2,1,1]).list()
        [{{1}, {2}, {3, 4}},
         {{1}, {2, 4}, {3}},
         {{1}, {2, 3}, {4}},
         {{1, 4}, {2}, {3}},
         {{1, 3}, {2}, {4}},
         {{1, 2}, {3}, {4}}]

    Since :trac:`14140`, we can create a set partition directly by
    :class:`SetPartition`, which creates the base set by taking the
    union of the parts passed in::

        sage: s = SetPartition([[1,3],[2,4]]); s
        {{1, 3}, {2, 4}}

    r"""
    An (unordered) partition of a set `S` is a set of pairwise
    disjoint nonempty subsets with union `S`, and is represented
    by a sorted list of such subsets.

    ``SetPartitions(s)`` returns the class of all set partitions of the set
    ``s``, which can be given as a set or a string; if a string, each
    character is considered an element.

    ``SetPartitions(n)``, where ``n`` is an integer, returns the class of
    all set partitions of the set `\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}`.

    You may specify a second argument `k`. If `k` is an integer,
    :class:`SetPartitions` returns the class of set partitions into `k` parts;
    if it is an integer partition, :class:`SetPartitions` returns the class of
    set partitions whose block sizes correspond to that integer partition.

    The Bell number `B_n`, named in honor of Eric Temple Bell,
    is the number of different partitions of a set with `n` elements.
