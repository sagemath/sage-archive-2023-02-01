Generic structures for linear codes over the Hamming metric

Linear Codes
============

Let `F = \GF{q}` be a finite field. A rank `k` linear subspace of the vector
space `F^n` is called an `[n, k]`-linear code, `n` being the length of the code
and `k` its dimension. Elements of a code `C` are called codewords.

A linear map from `F^k` to an `[n,k]` code `C` is called an "encoding", and it
can be represented as a `k \times n` matrix, called a generator matrix.
Alternatively, `C` can be represented by its orthogonal complement in `F^n`,
i.e. the `(n-k)`-dimensional vector space `C^\perp` such that the inner product
of any element from `C` and any element from `C^\perp` is zero. `C^\perp` is
called the dual code of `C`, and any generator matrix for `C^\perp` is called a
parity check matrix for `C`.

We commonly endow `F^n` with the Hamming metric, i.e. the weight of a vector is
the number of non-zero elements in it. The central operation of a linear code
is then "decoding": given a linear code `C \subset F^n` and a "received word"
`r \in F^n` , retrieve the codeword `c \in C` such that the Hamming distance
between `r` and `c` is minimal.

Families or Generic codes
=========================

Linear codes are either studied as generic vector spaces without any known
structure, or as particular sub-families with special properties.

The class :class:`sage.coding.linear_code.LinearCode` is used to represent the
former.

For the latter, these will be represented by specialised classes; for instance,
the family of Hamming codes are represented by the class
:class:`sage.coding.hamming_code.HammingCode`. Type ``codes.<tab>`` for a list
of all code families known to Sage. Such code family classes should inherit from
the abstract base class :class:`sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode`.

``AbstractLinearCode``
----------------------

This is a base class designed to contain methods, features and parameters
shared by every linear code. For instance, generic algorithms for computing the
minimum distance, the covering radius, etc. Many of these algorithms are slow,
e.g. exponential in the code length. For specific subfamilies, better algorithms
or even closed formulas might be known, in which case the respective method
should be overridden.

``AbstractLinearCode`` is an abstract class for linear codes, so any linear code
class should inherit from this class. Also ``AbstractLinearCode`` should never
itself be instantiated.

See :class:`sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode` for details and
examples.

``LinearCode``
--------------

This class is used to represent arbitrary and unstructured linear codes.  It
mostly rely directly on generic methods provided by ``AbstractLinearCode``,
which means that basic operations on the code (e.g. computation of the minimum
distance) will use slow algorithms.

A ``LinearCode`` is instantiated by providing a generator matrix::

    sage: M = matrix(GF(2), [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\
                             [0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\
                             [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]])
    sage: C = codes.LinearCode(M)
    sage: C
    [5, 3] linear code over GF(2)
    sage: C.generator_matrix()
    [1 0 0 1 0]
    [0 1 0 1 1]
    [0 0 1 1 1]

    sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(2),4,7)
    sage: G = MS([[1,1,1,0,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1,1,0,0], [0,1,0,1,0,1,0], [1,1,0,1,0,0,1]])
    sage: C = LinearCode(G)
    sage: C.basis()
    [
    (1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
    (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0),
    (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0),
    (1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)
    ]
    sage: c = C.basis()[1]
    sage: c in C
    True
    sage: c.nonzero_positions()
    [0, 3, 4]
    sage: c.support()
    [0, 3, 4]
    sage: c.parent()
    Vector space of dimension 7 over Finite Field of size 2

class AbstractLinearCode(AbstractLinearCodeNoMetric):
    """
    Abstract base class for linear codes.

    This class contains all methods that can be used on Linear Codes and on
    Linear Codes families.  So, every Linear Code-related class should inherit
    from this abstract class.

    To implement a linear code, you need to:

    - inherit from AbstractLinearCode

    - call AbstractLinearCode ``__init__`` method in the subclass constructor. Example:
      ``super(SubclassName, self).__init__(base_field, length, "EncoderName", "DecoderName")``.
      By doing that, your subclass will have its ``length`` parameter
      initialized and will be properly set as a member of the category framework.
      You need of course to complete the constructor by adding any additional parameter
      needed to describe properly the code defined in the subclass.

    - Add the following two lines on the class level::

          _registered_encoders = {}
          _registered_decoders = {}


    - fill the dictionary of its encoders in ``sage.coding.__init__.py`` file. Example:
      I want to link the encoder ``MyEncoderClass`` to ``MyNewCodeClass``
      under the name ``MyEncoderName``.
      All I need to do is to write this line in the ``__init__.py`` file:
      ``MyNewCodeClass._registered_encoders["NameOfMyEncoder"] = MyEncoderClass`` and all instances of
      ``MyNewCodeClass`` will be able to use instances of ``MyEncoderClass``.

    - fill the dictionary of its decoders in ``sage.coding.__init__`` file. Example:
      I want to link the encoder ``MyDecoderClass`` to ``MyNewCodeClass``
      under the name ``MyDecoderName``.
      All I need to do is to write this line in the ``__init__.py`` file:
      ``MyNewCodeClass._registered_decoders["NameOfMyDecoder"] = MyDecoderClass`` and all instances of
      ``MyNewCodeClass`` will be able to use instances of ``MyDecoderClass``.


    As AbstractLinearCode is not designed to be implemented, it does not have any representation
    methods. You should implement ``_repr_`` and ``_latex_`` methods in the subclass.

    .. NOTE::

        :class:`AbstractLinearCode` has a generic implementation of the
        method ``__eq__`` which uses the generator matrix and is quite
        slow. In subclasses you are encouraged to override ``__eq__``
        and ``__hash__``.

    .. WARNING::

        The default encoder should always have `F^{k}` as message space, with `k` the dimension
        of the code and `F` is the base ring of the code.

        A lot of methods of the abstract class rely on the knowledge of a generator matrix.
        It is thus strongly recommended to set an encoder with a generator matrix implemented
        as a default encoder.

        TESTS:

        This class uses the following experimental feature:
        :class:`sage.coding.relative_finite_field_extension.RelativeFiniteFieldExtension`.
        This test block is here only to trigger the experimental warning so it does not
        interferes with doctests::

            doctest:...: FutureWarning: This class/method/function is marked as experimental. It, its functionality or its interface might change without a formal deprecation.

        This method only exists for inheritance purposes as it initializes
        parameters that need to be known by every linear code. The class
        :class:`sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode` should never be
        directly instantiated.

        INPUT:

        - ``base_field`` -- the base field of ``self``

        - ``length`` -- the length of ``self`` (a Python int or a Sage Integer, must be > 0)

        - ``default_encoder_name`` -- the name of the default encoder of ``self``

        - ``default_decoder_name`` -- the name of the default decoder of ``self``

        EXAMPLES:

        The following example demonstrates how to subclass `AbstractLinearCode`
        for representing a new family of codes. The example family is non-sensical::

            sage: class MyCodeFamily(sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode):
            ....:   def __init__(self, field, length, dimension, generator_matrix):
            ....:       sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode.__init__(self,field, length, "GeneratorMatrix", "Syndrome")
            ....:       self._dimension = dimension
            ....:       self._generator_matrix = generator_matrix
            ....:   def generator_matrix(self):
            ....:       return self._generator_matrix
            ....:   def _repr_(self):
            ....:       return "[%d, %d] dummy code over GF(%s)" % (self.length(), self.dimension(), self.base_field().cardinality())

        We now instantiate a member of our newly made code family::

            sage: generator_matrix = matrix(GF(17), 5, 10,
            ....:                           {(i,i):1 for i in range(5)})
            sage: C = MyCodeFamily(GF(17), 10, 5, generator_matrix)

        We can check its existence and parameters::

            sage: C
            [10, 5] dummy code over GF(17)

        We can check that it is truly a part of the framework category::

            sage: C.parent()
            <class '__main__.MyCodeFamily_with_category'>
            sage: C.category()
            Category of facade finite dimensional vector spaces with basis over Finite Field of size 17

        And any method that works on linear codes works for our new dummy code::

            sage: C.minimum_distance()
            1
            sage: C.is_self_orthogonal()

        Assmus and Mattson Theorem (section 8.4, page 303 of [HP2003]_): Let
        `A_0, A_1, ..., A_n` be the weights of the codewords in a binary
        linear `[n , k, d]` code `C`, and let `A_0^*, A_1^*, ..., A_n^*` be
        the weights of the codewords in its dual `[n, n-k, d^*]` code `C^*`.
        Fix a `t`, `0<t<d`, and let

        .. MATH::

           s = |\{ i\ |\ A_i^* \not= 0, 0< i \leq n-t\}|.

        Assume `s\leq d-t`.

        1. If `A_i\not= 0` and `d\leq i\leq n`
           then `C_i = \{ c \in C\ |\ wt(c) = i\}` holds a simple t-design.

        2. If `A_i^*\not= 0` and `d*\leq i\leq n-t` then
           `C_i^* = \{ c \in C^*\ |\ wt(c) = i\}` holds a simple t-design.

        A block design is a pair `(X,B)`, where `X` is a non-empty finite set
        of `v>0` elements called points, and `B` is a non-empty finite
        multiset of size b whose elements are called blocks, such that each
        block is a non-empty finite multiset of `k` points. `A` design without
        repeated blocks is called a simple block design. If every subset of
        points of size `t` is contained in exactly `\lambda` blocks the block
        design is called a `t-(v,k,\lambda)` design (or simply a `t`-design
        when the parameters are not specified). When `\lambda=1` then the
        block design is called a `S(t,k,v)` Steiner system.

        In the Assmus and Mattson Theorem (1), `X` is the set `\{1,2,...,n\}`
        of coordinate locations and `B = \{supp(c)\ |\ c \in C_i\}` is the set
        of supports of the codewords of `C` of weight `i`. Therefore, the
        parameters of the `t`-design for `C_i` are

        ::

            t =       given
            v =       n
            k =       i   (k not to be confused with dim(C))
            b =       Ai
            lambda = b*binomial(k,t)/binomial(v,t) (by Theorem 8.1.6,
                                                       p 294, in [HP2003]_)

        Setting the ``mode="verbose"`` option prints out the values of the
        parameters.

        The first example below means that the binary [24,12,8]-code C has
        the property that the (support of the) codewords of weight 8 (resp.,
        12, 16) form a 5-design. Similarly for its dual code `C^*` (of course
        `C=C^*` in this case, so this info is extraneous). The test fails to
        produce 6-designs (ie, the hypotheses of the theorem fail to hold,
        not that the 6-designs definitely don't exist). The command
        assmus_mattson_designs(C,5,mode="verbose") returns the same value
        but prints out more detailed information.

        The second example below illustrates the blocks of the 5-(24, 8, 1)
        design (i.e., the S(5,8,24) Steiner system).

            the base field of the code has size greater than 256 due
            to limitations in GAP.

           GAP methods will be used. ``algorithm`` can be:
           - ``"Guava"``, which will use optional GAP package Guava

        REMARKS:

        - The code in the default case allows one (for free) to also compute the
          message vector `m` such that `m\*G = v`, and the (minimum) distance, as
          a triple.  however, this output is not implemented.
        - The binary case can presumably be done much faster using Robert Miller's
          code (see the docstring for the spectrum method). This is also not (yet)
          implemented.

        If `C` is an `[n,k,d]` code over `F`, this function computes the

        The binary case always uses the (default) partition refinement
        algorithm of Robert Miller.

        Note that if the base ring of `C` is `GF(2)` then this is the full

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` - If ``"gap"`` then GAP's MatrixAutomorphism function
          (written by Thomas Breuer) is used. The implementation combines an
          idea of mine with an improvement suggested by Cary Huffman. If
          ``"gap+verbose"`` then code-theoretic data is printed out at
          several stages of the computation. If ``"partition"`` then the
          (default) partition refinement algorithm of Robert Miller is used.
          Finally, if ``"codecan"`` then the partition refinement algorithm
          of Thomas Feulner is used, which also computes a canonical
          representative of ``self`` (call

        Return the weight distribution, or spectrum, of ``self`` as a list.

        The weight distribution a code of length `n` is the sequence `A_0,
        A_1,..., A_n` where `A_i` is the number of codewords of weight `i`.

        INPUT:

          ``"binary"``, use an algorithm optimized for binary codes. The default
          is to use ``"binary"`` for binary codes and ``"gap"`` otherwise.

        OUTPUT:

        - A list of non-negative integers: the weight distribution.

        .. WARNING::

            Specifying ``algorithm = "leon"`` sometimes prints a traceback
            related to a stack smashing error in the C library. The result
            appears to be computed correctly, however. It appears to run much

class LinearCode(AbstractLinearCode):
    r"""
    Linear codes over a finite field or finite ring, represented using a
    generator matrix.

    This class should be used for arbitrary and unstructured linear codes. This
    means that basic operations on the code, such as the computation of the
    minimum distance, will use generic, slow algorithms.

    If you are looking for constructing a code from a more specific family, see
    if the family has been implemented by investigating `codes.<tab>`. These
    more specific classes use properties particular to that family to allow
    faster algorithms, and could also have family-specific methods.

    See :wikipedia:`Linear_code` for more information on unstructured linear codes.

    INPUT:

    - ``generator`` -- a generator matrix over a finite field (``G`` can be
      defined over a finite ring but the matrices over that ring must have
      certain attributes, such as ``rank``); or a code over a finite field

    - ``d`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) the minimum distance of the code

    .. NOTE::

        The veracity of the minimum distance ``d``, if provided, is not
        checked.

####################### decoders ###############################

class LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(Decoder):
    r"""
    Constructs a decoder for Linear Codes based on syndrome lookup table.

    The decoding algorithm works as follows:

    - First, a lookup table is built by computing the syndrome of every error
      pattern of weight up to ``maximum_error_weight``.
    - Then, whenever one tries to decode a word ``r``, the syndrome of ``r`` is
      computed. The corresponding error pattern is recovered from the
      pre-computed lookup table.
    - Finally, the recovered error pattern is subtracted from ``r`` to recover
      the original word.

    ``maximum_error_weight`` need never exceed the covering radius of the code,
    since there are then always lower-weight errors with the same syndrome. If
    one sets ``maximum_error_weight`` to a value greater than the covering
    radius, then the covering radius will be determined while building the
    lookup-table. This lower value is then returned if you query
    ``decoding_radius`` after construction.

    If ``maximum_error_weight`` is left unspecified or set to a number at least
    the covering radius of the code, this decoder is complete, i.e. it decodes
    every vector in the ambient space.

    .. NOTE::

        Constructing the lookup table takes time exponential in the length of the
        code and the size of the code's base field. Afterwards, the individual
        decodings are fast.

    INPUT:

    - ``code`` -- A code associated to this decoder

    - ``maximum_error_weight`` -- (default: ``None``) the maximum number of
      errors to look for when building the table. An error is raised if it is
      set greater than `n-k`, since this is an upper bound on the covering
      radius on any linear code. If ``maximum_error_weight`` is kept
      unspecified, it will be set to `n - k`, where `n` is the length of
      ``code`` and `k` its dimension.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: G = Matrix(GF(3), [[1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2],[0,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0,2,2,2,1,2]])
        sage: C = LinearCode(G)
        sage: D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C)
        sage: D
        Syndrome decoder for [9, 3] linear code over GF(3) handling errors of weight up to 4

    If one wants to correct up to a lower number of errors, one can do as follows::

        sage: D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C, maximum_error_weight=2)
        sage: D
        Syndrome decoder for [9, 3] linear code over GF(3) handling errors of weight up to 2

    If one checks the list of types of this decoder before constructing it,
    one will notice it contains the keyword ``dynamic``.
    Indeed, the behaviour of the syndrome decoder depends on the maximum
    error weight one wants to handle, and how it compares to the minimum
    distance and the covering radius of ``code``.
    In the following examples, we illustrate this property by computing
    different instances of syndrome decoder for the same code.

    We choose the following linear code, whose covering radius equals to 4
    and minimum distance to 5 (half the minimum distance is 2)::

        sage: G = matrix(GF(5), [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0],
        ....:                    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1],
        ....:                    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 4, 1],
        ....:                    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3],
        ....:                    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1]])
        sage: C = LinearCode(G)

    In the following examples, we illustrate how the choice of
    ``maximum_error_weight`` influences the types of the instance of
    syndrome decoder, alongside with its decoding radius.

    We build a first syndrome decoder, and pick a ``maximum_error_weight``
    smaller than both the covering radius and half the minimum distance::

        sage: D = C.decoder("Syndrome", maximum_error_weight = 1)
        sage: D.decoder_type()
        {'always-succeed', 'bounded_distance', 'hard-decision'}
        sage: D.decoding_radius()
        1

    In that case, we are sure the decoder will always succeed. It is also
    a bounded distance decoder.

    We now build another syndrome decoder, and this time,
    ``maximum_error_weight`` is chosen to be bigger than half the minimum distance,
    but lower than the covering radius::

        sage: D = C.decoder("Syndrome", maximum_error_weight = 3)
        sage: D.decoder_type()
        {'bounded_distance', 'hard-decision', 'might-error'}
        sage: D.decoding_radius()
        3

    Here, we still get a bounded distance decoder.
    But because we have a maximum error weight bigger than half the
    minimum distance, we know it might return a codeword which was not
    the original codeword.

    And now, we build a third syndrome decoder, whose ``maximum_error_weight``
    is bigger than both the covering radius and half the minimum distance::

        sage: D = C.decoder("Syndrome", maximum_error_weight = 5) # long time
        sage: D.decoder_type() # long time

    In that case, the decoder might still return an unexpected codeword, but
    it is now complete. Note the decoding radius is equal to 4: it was
    determined while building the syndrome lookup table that any error with
    weight more than 4 will be decoded incorrectly. That is because the covering
    radius for the code is 4.

    The minimum distance and the covering radius are both determined while
    computing the syndrome lookup table. They user did not explicitly ask to
    compute these on the code ``C``. The dynamic typing of the syndrome decoder
    might therefore seem slightly surprising, but in the end is quite
    informative.
