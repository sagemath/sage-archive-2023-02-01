Linear Codes

VERSION: 1.2

Let `F` be a finite field.  Here, we will denote the finite field with `q`
elements by `\GF{q}`.  A subspace of `F^n` (with the standard basis) is
called a linear code of length `n`.  If its dimension is denoted `k` then we
typically store a basis of `C` as a `k \times n` matrix, with rows the basis
vectors.  It is called the generator matrix of `C`. The rows of the parity
check matrix of `C` are a basis for the code,

.. math::

      C^* = \{ v \in GF(q)^n\ |\ v\cdot c = 0,\ for \ all\ c \in C \},

called the dual space of `C`.

If `F=\GF{2}` then `C` is called a binary code.  If `F = \GF{q}` then `C` is
called a `q`-ary code.  The elements of a code `C` are called codewords.

Let `C`, `D` be linear codes of length `n` and dimension `k`. There are
several notions of equivalence for linear codes:

`C` and `D` are

    - permutational equivalent, if there is some permutation `\pi \in S_n`
      such that `(c_{\pi(0)}, \ldots, c_{\pi(n-1)}) \in D` for all `c \in C`.

    - linear equivalent, if there is some permutation `\pi \in S_n` and a
      vector `\phi` of units of length `n` such that
      `(c_{\pi(0)} \phi_0^{-1}, \ldots, c_{\pi(n-1)} \phi_{n-1}^{-1}) \in D`
      for all `c \in C`.

    - semilinear equivalent, if there is some permutation `\pi \in S_n`, a
      vector `\phi` of units of length `n` and a field automorphism `\alpha`
      such that
      `(\alpha(c_{\pi(0)}) \phi_0^{-1}, \ldots, \alpha( c_{\pi(n-1)}) \phi_{n-1}^{-1} ) \in D`
      for all `c \in C`.

These are group actions. If one of these group elements sends
the linear code `C` to itself, then we will call it an automorphism.
Depending on the group action we will call those groups:

    - permuation automorphism group

    - monomial automorphism group (every linear Hamming isometry is a monomial
      transformation of the ambient space, for `n\geq 3`)

    - automorphism group (every semilinear Hamming isometry is a semimonomial
      transformation of the ambient space, for `n\geq 3`)

This file contains

#. LinearCode class definition; LinearCodeFromVectorspace conversion function,

#. The spectrum (weight distribution), covering_radius, minimum distance
   programs (calling Steve Linton's or CJ Tjhal's C programs),
   characteristic_function, and several implementations of the Duursma zeta
   function (sd_zeta_polynomial, zeta_polynomial, zeta_function,
   chinen_polynomial, for example),

#. interface with best_known_linear_code_www (interface with codetables.de
   since A. Brouwer's online tables have been disabled),
   bounds_minimum_distance which call tables in GUAVA (updated May 2006)
   created by Cen Tjhai instead of the online internet tables,

#. generator_matrix, generator_matrix_systematic, information_set, list, parity_check_matrix,
   decode, dual_code, extended_code, shortened, punctured, genus, binomial_moment,
   and divisor methods for LinearCode,

#. Boolean-valued functions such as "==", is_self_dual, is_self_orthogonal,
   is_subcode, is_permutation_automorphism, is_permutation_equivalent (which
   interfaces with Robert Miller's partition refinement code),

#. permutation methods: is_permutation_automorphism,
   permutation_automorphism_group, permuted_code, standard_form,
   module_composition_factors,

#. design-theoretic methods: assmus_mattson_designs (implementing
   Assmus-Mattson Theorem),

#. code constructions, such as HammingCode and ToricCode, are in a separate
   ``code_constructions.py`` module; in the separate ``guava.py`` module, you
   will find constructions, such as RandomLinearCodeGuava and
   BinaryReedMullerCode, wrapped from the corresponding GUAVA codes.

    Uses C programs written by Steve Linton in the kernel of GAP, so is fairly

    requires GAP but not Guava.

    - The code in the default case allows one (for free) to also compute the
      message vector `m` such that `m\*G = v`, and the (minimum) distance, as
      a triple.  however, this output is not implemented.
    - The binary case can presumably be done much faster using Robert Miller's
      code (see the docstring for the spectrum method). This is also not (yet)
      implemented.

        sage: Gstr = "Z(2)*[[1,1,1,0,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1,1,0,0], [0,1,0,1,0,1,0], [1,1,0,1,0,0,1]]"

def bounds_minimum_distance(n, k, F):
    r"""
    Calculates a lower and upper bound for the minimum distance of an optimal
    linear code with word length ``n`` and dimension ``k`` over the field
    ``F``.

    The function returns a record with the two bounds and an explanation for
    each bound. The function Display can be used to show the explanations.

    The values for the lower and upper bound are obtained from a table
    constructed by Cen Tjhai for GUAVA, derived from the table of
    Brouwer. See http://www.codetables.de/ for the most recent data.
    These tables contain lower and upper bounds for `q=2` (when ``n <= 257``),
    `q=3` (when ``n <= 243``), `q=4` (``n <= 256``). (Current as of
    11 May 2006.) For codes over other fields and for larger word lengths,
    trivial bounds are used.

    This does not require an internet connection. The format of the output is
    a little non-intuitive. Try ``bounds_minimum_distance(10,5,GF(2))`` for
    an example.

    This function requires optional GAP package (Guava).

class AbstractLinearCode(module.Module):
    """
    Abstract class for linear codes.

    This class contains all methods that can be used on Linear Codes
    and on Linear Codes families.
    So, every Linear Code-related class should inherit from this abstract
    class.

    To implement a linear code, you need to:

    - inherit from AbstractLinearCode

    - call AbstractLinearCode ``__init__`` method in the subclass constructor. Example:
      ``super(SubclassName, self).__init__(base_field, length)``.
      By doing that, your subclass will have its ``length`` parameter
      initialized and will be properly set as a member of the category framework.
      You need of course to complete the constructor by adding any additional parameter
      needed to describe properly the code defined in the subclass.

    - fill the dictionary of its encoders in ``sage.coding.__init__.py`` file. Example:
      I want to link the encoder ``MyEncoderClass`` to ``MyNewCodeClass``
      under the name ``MyEncoderName``.
      All I need to do is to write this line in the ``__init__.py`` file:
      ``MyNewCodeClass._registered_encoders["NameOfMyEncoder"] = MyEncoderClass`` and all instances of
      ``MyNewCodeClass`` will be able to use instances of ``MyEncoderClass``.

    As AbstractLinearCode is not designed to be implemented, it does not have any representation
    methods. You should implement ``_repr_`` and ``_latex_`` methods in the subclass.

    .. NOTE::

        :class:`AbstractLinearCode` has generic implementations of the comparison methods ``__cmp``
        and ``__eq__`` which use the generator matrix and are quite slow. In subclasses you are
        encouraged to override these functions.

    .. WARNING::

        The default encoder should always have `F^{k}` as message space, with `k` the dimension
        of the code and `F` is the base ring of the code.

        A lot of methods of the abstract class rely on the knowledge of a generator matrix.
        It is thus strongly recommended to set an encoder with a generator matrix implemented
        as a default encoder.

        """
        Initializes mandatory parameters for a Linear Code object.

        This method only exists for inheritance purposes as it initializes
        parameters that need to be known by every linear code. An abstract
        linear code object should never be created.

        INPUT:

        - ``base_field`` -- the base field of ``self``

        - ``length`` -- the length of ``self``

        - ``default_encoder_name`` -- the name of the default encoder of ``self``

        EXAMPLES:

        We first create a new LinearCode subclass::

            sage: class CodeExample(sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode):
            ....:   def __init__(self, field, length, dimension, generator_matrix):
            ....:       sage.coding.linear_code.AbstractLinearCode.__init__(self,field, length, "GeneratorMatrix")
            ....:       self._dimension = dimension
            ....:       self._generator_matrix = generator_matrix
            ....:   def generator_matrix(self):
            ....:       return self._generator_matrix
            ....:   def _repr_(self):
            ....:       return "Dummy code of length %d, dimension %d over %s" % (self.length(), self.dimension(), self.base_field())

        We now create a member of our newly made class::

            sage: generator_matrix = matrix(GF(17), 5, 10,
            ....:                           {(i,i):1 for i in range(5)})
            sage: C = CodeExample(GF(17), 10, 5, generator_matrix)

        We can check its existence and parameters::

            sage: C
            Dummy code of length 10, dimension 5 over Finite Field of size 17

        We can check that it is truly a part of the framework category::

            sage: C.parent()
            <class '__main__.CodeExample_with_category'>
            sage: C.category()
            Category of facade finite dimensional vector spaces with basis over Finite Field of size 17

        And any method that works on linear codes works for our new dummy code::

            sage: C.minimum_distance()
            1
            sage: C.is_self_orthogonal()
            False

        Assmus and Mattson Theorem (section 8.4, page 303 of [HP]): Let
        `A_0, A_1, ..., A_n` be the weights of the codewords in a binary
        linear `[n , k, d]` code `C`, and let `A_0^*, A_1^*, ..., A_n^*` be
        the weights of the codewords in its dual `[n, n-k, d^*]` code `C^*`.
        Fix a `t`, `0<t<d`, and let

        .. math::

           s = |\{ i\ |\ A_i^* \not= 0, 0< i \leq n-t\}|.

        Assume `s\leq d-t`.

        1. If `A_i\not= 0` and `d\leq i\leq n`
           then `C_i = \{ c \in C\ |\ wt(c) = i\}` holds a simple t-design.

        2. If `A_i^*\not= 0` and `d*\leq i\leq n-t` then
           `C_i^* = \{ c \in C^*\ |\ wt(c) = i\}` holds a simple t-design.

        A block design is a pair `(X,B)`, where `X` is a non-empty finite set
        of `v>0` elements called points, and `B` is a non-empty finite
        multiset of size b whose elements are called blocks, such that each
        block is a non-empty finite multiset of `k` points. `A` design without
        repeated blocks is called a simple block design. If every subset of
        points of size `t` is contained in exactly `\lambda` blocks the block
        design is called a `t-(v,k,\lambda)` design (or simply a `t`-design
        when the parameters are not specified). When `\lambda=1` then the
        block design is called a `S(t,k,v)` Steiner system.

        In the Assmus and Mattson Theorem (1), `X` is the set `\{1,2,...,n\}`
        of coordinate locations and `B = \{supp(c)\ |\ c \in C_i\}` is the set
        of supports of the codewords of `C` of weight `i`. Therefore, the
        parameters of the `t`-design for `C_i` are

        ::

            t =       given
            v =       n
            k =       i   (k not to be confused with dim(C))
            b =       Ai
            lambda = b*binomial(k,t)/binomial(v,t) (by Theorem 8.1.6,
                                                       p 294, in [HP])

        Setting the ``mode="verbose"`` option prints out the values of the
        parameters.

        The first example below means that the binary [24,12,8]-code C has
        the property that the (support of the) codewords of weight 8 (resp.,
        12, 16) form a 5-design. Similarly for its dual code `C^*` (of course
        `C=C^*` in this case, so this info is extraneous). The test fails to
        produce 6-designs (ie, the hypotheses of the theorem fail to hold,
        not that the 6-designs definitely don't exist). The command
        assmus_mattson_designs(C,5,mode="verbose") returns the same value
        but prints out more detailed information.

        The second example below illustrates the blocks of the 5-(24, 8, 1)
        design (i.e., the S(5,8,24) Steiner system).

    def covering_radius(self):
        r"""
        Wraps Guava's ``CoveringRadius`` command.

        The covering radius of a linear code `C` is the smallest number `r`
        with the property that each element `v` of the ambient vector space
        of `C` has at most a distance `r` to the code `C`. So for each
        vector `v` there must be an element `c` of `C` with `d(v,c) \leq  r`.
        A binary linear code with reasonable small covering radius is often
        referred to as a covering code.

        For example, if `C` is a perfect code, the covering radius is equal
        to `t`, the number of errors the code can correct, where `d = 2t+1`,
        with `d` the minimum distance of `C`.

        Returns the `i`-th codeword of this code.

        The implementation of this depends on the implementation of the
        :meth:`.__iter__` method.

        The implementation is as follows. Suppose that:

        - the primitive element of the base_ring of this code is `a`,
        - the prime subfield is `p`,
        - the field has order `p^m`,
        - the code has dimension `k`,
        - and the generator matrix is `G`.

        Then the :meth:`.__iter__` method returns the elements in this order:

        1. first, the following ordered list is returned:
           ``[i*a^0 * G[0] for i in range(p)]``
        2. Next, the following ordered list is returned:
           ``[i*a^0 * G[0] + a^1*G[0] for i in range(p)]``
        3. This continues till we get
           ``[(i*a^0 +(p-1)*a^1 +...+ (p-1)*a^(m-1))*G[0] for i in range(p)]``
        4. Then, we move to G[1]:
           ``[i*a^0 * G[0] + a^0*G[1] for i in range(p)]``,
         and so on.
         Hence the `i`-th element can be obtained by the p-adic expansion
         of `i` as ``[i_0, i_1, ...,i_{m-1}, i_m, i_{m+1}, ..., i_{km-1}].``
         The element that is generated is:

        .. math::

             \begin{aligned}
             & (i_0 a^0 + i_1 a^1 + \cdots + i_{m-1} a^{m-1}) G[0] + \\
             & (i_m a^0 + i_{m+1} a^1 + \cdots + i_{2m-1} a^{m-1}) G[1] + \\
             & \vdots\\

        The ``algorithm="verbose"`` option also returns a permutation (if
        ``True``) sending ``self`` to ``other``.

        Returns the minimum distance of this linear code.

        By default, this uses a GAP kernel function (in C and not part of

        `q` is 2 or 3 then this uses a very fast program written in C written
        by CJ Tjhal. (This is much faster, except in some small examples.)

        Raises a ``ValueError`` in case there is no non-zero vector in this
        linear code.

        The minimum distance of the code is stored once it has been
        computed or provided during the initialization of :class:`LinearCode`.
        If ``algorithm`` is ``None`` and the stored value of minimum
        distance is found, then the stored value will be returned without
        recomputing the minimum distance again.

        without further computations.::

          several stages of the computation. If ``"partition"`` then the

          of Thomas Feulner is used, which also computes a canonical
          representative of ``self`` (call

        Returns the spectrum of ``self`` as a list.

        The default algorithm uses a GAP kernel function (in C) written by
        Steve Linton.

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` - ``None``, ``"gap"``, ``"leon"``, or ``"binary"``;
          defaults to ``"gap"`` except in the binary case.  If ``"gap"`` then
          uses the GAP function, if ``"leon"`` then uses Jeffrey Leon's
          software via Guava, and if ``"binary"`` then uses Sage native Cython
          code

        - List, the spectrum

        The optional algorithm (``"leon"``) may create a stack smashing error
        and a traceback but should return the correct answer. It appears to run
        much faster than the GAP algorithm in some small examples and much
        slower than the GAP algorithm in other larger examples.

        Returns the standard form of this linear code.

        An `[n,k]` linear code with generator matrix `G` in standard form is
        the row-reduced echelon form of `G` is `(I,A)`, where `I` denotes the
        `k \times k` identity matrix and `A` is a `k \times (n-k)` block. This
        method returns a pair `(C,p)` where `C` is a code permutation
        equivalent to ``self`` and `p` in `S_n`, with `n` the length of `C`,
        is the permutation sending ``self`` to `C`. This does not call GAP.

class LinearCode(AbstractLinearCode):
    r"""
    Linear codes over a finite field or finite ring, represented using a
    generator matrix.

    This class should be used for arbitrary and unstructured linear codes. This
    means that basic operations on the code, such as the computation of the
    minimum distance, will use generic, slow algorithms.

    If you are looking for constructing a code from a more specific family, see
    if the family has been implemented by investigating codes.<tab>. These
    more specific classes use properties particular for that family to allow
    faster algorithms, and could also have family-specific methods.

    See :wikipedia:`Linear_code` for more information on unstructured linear codes.

    INPUT:

    - ``generator_matrix`` -- a generator matrix over a finite field (``G`` can be
      defined over a finite ring but the matrices over that ring must have
      certain attributes, such as ``rank``)

    - ``d`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) the minimum distance of the code

    .. NOTE::

        The veracity of the minimum distance ``d``, if provided, is not
        checked.
