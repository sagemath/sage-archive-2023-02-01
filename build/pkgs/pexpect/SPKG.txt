== Description ==

Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications;
controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output.

== License ==

Python Software Foundation License

== Upstream Contact ==


== Dependencies ==

 * GNU patch
 * Python

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * pexpect-2.1 is shockingly slow for Sage (especially in the notebook)
   and I can't figure out why.  So we're sticking with pexpect-2.0 for
   now (which works fine for us).

Patches:
 * del.patch: put a try/except inside __del__, to get rid of lots of
   pointless warning messages
 * pexpect.py-isdir_bug_fix.patch: fixed bug in pexpect.py where it
   tried to run directories
 * env.patch: add env parameter to spawn.__init__() to run a command
   with custom environment variables (as in pexpect-2.3).
