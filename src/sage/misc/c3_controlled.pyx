"""
The ``C3`` algorithm, under control of a total order.

Abstract
========

Python handles multiple inheritance by computing, for each class,
a linear extension of all its super classes (the Method Resolution
Order, MRO). The MRO is calculated recursively from local
information (the *ordered* list of the direct super classes), with
the so-called ``C3`` algorithm. This algorithm can fail if the local
information is not consistent; worst, there exist hierarchies of
classes with provably no consistent local information.

For large hierarchy of classes, like those derived from categories in
Sage, maintaining consistent local information by hand does not scale
and leads to unpredictable ``C3`` failures (the dreaded "could not
find a consistent method resolution order"); a maintenance nightmare.

This module implements a final solution to this problem. Namely, it
allows for building automatically the local information from the bare
class hierarchy in such a way that guarantees that the ``C3``
algorithm will never fail.

Err, but you said that this was provably impossible? Well, not if one
relaxes a bit the hypotheses; but that's not something one would want
to do by hand :-)

The problem
===========

Consider the following hierarchy of classes::

    sage: class A1(object): pass
    sage: class A2(object):
    ....:     def foo(self): return 2
    sage: class A3(object): pass
    sage: class A4(object):
    ....:     def foo(self): return 4
    sage: class A5(A2, A1):
    ....:     def foo(self): return 5
    sage: class A6(A4, A3): pass
    sage: class A7(A6, A5): pass

If ``a`` is an instance of ``A7``, then Python needs to choose which
implementation to use upon calling ``a.foo()``: that of ``A4`` or
``A5``, but obviously not that of ``A2``. In Python, like in many
other dynamic object oriented languages, this is achieved by
calculating once for all a specific linear extension of the hierarchy
of the super classes of each class, called its Method Resolution Order
(MRO)::

    sage: [cls.__name__ for cls in A7.mro()]
    ['A7', 'A6', 'A4', 'A3', 'A5', 'A2', 'A1', 'object']

Thus, in our example, the implementation in ``A4`` is chosen::

    sage: a = A7()
    sage: a.foo()
    4

Specifically, the MRO is calculated using the so-called ``C3``
algorithm which guarantees that the MRO respects non only inheritance,
but also the order in which the bases (direct super classes) are given
for each class.

However, for large hierarchy of classes with lots of multiple
inheritance, like those derived from categories in Sage, this
algorithm easily fails if the order of the bases is not chosen
consistently (here for ``A2`` w.r.t. ``A1``)::

    sage: class B6(A1,A2): pass
    sage: class B7(B6,A5): pass
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
        Cannot create a consistent method resolution
    order (MRO) for bases ...

There actually exist hierarchy of classes for which ``C3`` fails
whatever the order of the bases is chosen; the smallest such example,
admittedly artificial, has ten classes (see below). Still, this
highlights that this problem has to be tackled in a systematic way.

Fortunately, one can trick ``C3``, without changing the inheritance
semantic, by adding some super classes of ``A`` to the bases of
``A``. In the following example, we completely force a given MRO by
specifying *all* the super classes of ``A`` as bases::

    sage: class A7(A6, A5, A4, A3, A2, A1): pass
    sage: [cls.__name__ for cls in A7.mro()]
    ['A7', 'A6', 'A5', 'A4', 'A3', 'A2', 'A1', 'object']

Luckily this can be optimized; here it is sufficient to add a single
base to enforce the same MRO::

    sage: class A7(A6, A5, A4): pass
    sage: [cls.__name__ for cls in A7.mro()]
    ['A7', 'A6', 'A5', 'A4', 'A3', 'A2', 'A1', 'object']

A strategy to solve the problem
===============================

We should recall at this point a design decision that we took for the
hierarchy of classes derived from categories: *the semantic shall only
depend on the inheritance order*, not on the specific MRO, and in
particular not on the order of the bases (see :mod:`sage.combinat.primer`).
If a choice needs to be made (for example for efficiency reasons),
then this should be done explicitly, on a method-by-method basis. In
practice this design goal is not yet met.

.. NOTE::

    When managing large hierarchies of classes in other contexts this
    may be too strong a design decision.

The strategy we use for hierarchy of classes derived from categories
is then:

1. To choose a global total order on the whole hierarchy of classes.
2. To control ``C3`` to get it to return MROs that follow this total order.

A basic approach for point 1., that will work for any hierarchy of
classes, is to enumerate the classes while they are constructed
(making sure that the bases of each class are enumerated before that
class), and to order the classes according to that enumeration. A more
conceptual ordering may be desirable, in particular to get
deterministic and reproducible results. In the context of Sage, this
is mostly relevant for those doctests displaying all the categories or
classes that an object inherits from.

Getting fine control on C3
==========================

This module is about point 2.

The natural approach would be to change the algorithm used by Python
to compute the MRO. However, changing Python's default algorithm just
for our needs is obviously not an option, and there is currently no
hook to customize specific classes to use a different
algorithm. Pushing the addition of such a hook into stock Python would
take too much time and effort.

Another approach would be to use the "adding bases" trick
straightforwardly, putting the list of *all* the super classes of a
class as its bases. However, this would have several drawbacks:

- It is not so elegant, in particular because it duplicates
  information: we already know through ``A5`` that ``A7`` is a
  subclass of ``A1``. This duplication coud be acceptable in our
  context because the hierarchy of classes is generated automatically
  from a conceptual hierarchy (the categories) which serves as single
  point of truth for calculating the bases of each class.

- It increases the complexity of the calculation of the MRO with
  ``C3``. For example, for a linear hierachy of classes, the
  complexity goes from `O(n^2)` to `O(n^3)` which is not acceptable.

- It increases the complexity of inspecting the classes. For example,
  the current implementation of the ``dir`` command in Python has no
  cache, and its complexity is linear in the number of maximal paths
  in the class hierarchy graph as defined by the bases. For a linear
  hierarchy, this is of complexity `O(p_n)` where `p_n` is the number
  of integer partitions of `n`, which is exponential. And indeed,
  running ``dir`` for a typical class like
  ``GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ).parent_class`` with ``37`` super
  classes took `18` seconds with this approach.

  Granted: this mostly affects the ``dir`` command and could be blamed
  on its current implementation. With appropriate caching, it could be
  reimplemented to have a complexity roughly linear in the number of
  classes in the hierarchy. But this won't happen any time soon in a
  stock Python.

This module refines this approach to make it acceptable, if not
seemless. Given a hierarchy and a total order on this hierarchy, it
calculates for each element of the hierarchy the smallest list of
additional bases that forces ``C3`` to return the desired MRO. This is
achieved by implementing an instrumented variant of the ``C3``
algorithm (which we call *instrumented ``C3``*) that detects when
``C3`` is about to take a wrong decision and adds one base to force
the right decision. Then, running the standard ``C3`` algorithm with
the updated list of bases (which we call *controlled ``C3``*) yields
the desired MRO.

EXAMPLES:

As an experimentation and testing tool, we use a class
:class:`HierarchyElement` whose instances can be constructed from a
hierarchy described by a poset, a digraph, or more generally a
successor relation. By default, the desired MRO is sorted
decreasingly. Another total order can be specified using a sorting
key.

We consider the smallest poset describing a class hierarchy admitting
no MRO whatsoever::

    sage: P = Poset({10: [9,8,7], 9:[6,1], 8:[5,2], 7:[4,3], 6: [3,2], 5:[3,1], 4: [2,1] }, facade=True)

And build a `HierarchyElement` from it::

    sage: from sage.misc.c3_controlled import HierarchyElement
    sage: x = HierarchyElement(10, P)

Here are its bases::

    sage: HierarchyElement(10, P)._bases
    [9, 8, 7]

Using the standard ``C3`` algorithm fails::

    sage: x.mro_standard
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Can not merge the items 3, 3, 2.

We also get a failure when we relabel `P` according to another linear
extension. For easy relabelling, we first need to set an appropriate
default linear extension for `P`::

    sage: P = P.with_linear_extension(reversed(IntegerRange(1,11)))
    sage: list(P)
    [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Now, we play with the fifth linear extension of `P`::

    sage: L = P.linear_extensions()
    sage: Q = L[5].to_poset()
    sage: Q.cover_relations()
    [[10, 9], [10, 8], [10, 7], [9, 6], [9, 3], [8, 5], [8, 2], [7, 4], [7, 1], [6, 2], [6, 1], [5, 3], [5, 1], [4, 3], [4, 2]]
    sage: x = HierarchyElement(10, Q)
    sage: x.mro_standard
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Can not merge the items 2, 3, 3.

On the other hand, both the instrumented ``C3`` algorithm, and the
controlled ``C3`` algorithm give the desired MRO::

    sage: x.mro
    [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    sage: x.mro_controlled
    [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

The above checks, and more, can be run with::

    sage: x._test_mro()

In practice, the control was achieved by adding the following bases::

    sage: x._bases
    [9, 8, 7]
    sage: x._bases_controlled
    [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]

Altogether, four bases were added for control::

    sage: sum(len(HierarchyElement(q, Q)._bases) for q in Q)
    15
    sage: sum(len(HierarchyElement(q, Q)._bases_controlled) for q in Q)
    19

This information can also be recoved with::

    sage: x.all_bases_len()
    15
    sage: x.all_bases_controlled_len()
    19

We now check that the ``C3`` algorithm fails for all linear extensions
`l` of this poset, whereas both the instrumented and controlled ``C3``
algorithms succeed; along the way, we collect some statistics::

    sage: stats = []
    sage: for l in L:
    ....:     x = HierarchyElement(10, l.to_poset())
    ....:     try:
    ....:         x.mro_standard
    ....:         assert False
    ....:     except:
    ....:         pass
    ....:     assert x.mro            == list(P)
    ....:     assert x.mro_controlled == list(P)
    ....:     assert x.all_bases_len() == 15
    ....:     stats.append(x.all_bases_controlled_len()-x.all_bases_len())

Depending on the linear extension `l` it was necessary to add between
one and five bases for control; for example, `216` linear extensions
required the addition of four bases::

    sage: Word(stats).evaluation_sparse()
    [(1, 36), (2, 108), (3, 180), (4, 216), (5, 180)]

We now consider a hierarchy of categories::

    sage: from operator import attrgetter
    sage: x = HierarchyElement(Groups(), attrcall("super_categories"), attrgetter("_cmp_key"))
    sage: x.mro
    [Category of groups, Category of monoids, Category of semigroups,
     Category of inverse unital magmas, Category of unital magmas, Category of magmas,
     Category of sets, Category of sets with partial maps, Category of objects]
    sage: x.mro_standard
    [Category of groups, Category of monoids, Category of semigroups,
     Category of inverse unital magmas, Category of unital magmas, Category of magmas,
     Category of sets, Category of sets with partial maps, Category of objects]

For a typical category, few bases, if any, need to be added to force
``C3`` to give the desired order::

    sage: C = FiniteFields()
    sage: x = HierarchyElement(C, attrcall("super_categories"), attrgetter("_cmp_key"))
    sage: x.mro == x.mro_standard
    False
    sage: x.all_bases_len()
    62
    sage: x.all_bases_controlled_len()
    64

    sage: C = GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ)
    sage: x = HierarchyElement(C, attrcall("super_categories"), attrgetter("_cmp_key"))
    sage: x._test_mro()
    sage: x.mro == x.mro_standard
    False
    sage: x.all_bases_len()
    82
    sage: x.all_bases_controlled_len()
    89

The following can be used to search through the Sage named categories
for any that requires the addition of some bases; currently none!::

    sage: from sage.categories.category import category_sample
    sage: sorted([C for C in category_sample() if len(C._super_categories_for_classes) != len(C.super_categories())], key=str)
    [Category of affine weyl groups,
     Category of commutative rings,
     Category of fields,
     Category of finite dimensional algebras with basis over Rational Field,
     Category of finite dimensional hopf algebras with basis over Rational Field,
     Category of graded hopf algebras with basis over Rational Field,
     Category of hopf algebras with basis over Rational Field]

cdef class CmpKey:
    r"""
    This class implements the lazy attribute :meth:`sage.categories.category.Category._cmp_key`.

    The comparison key ``A._cmp_key`` of a category is used to define
    an (almost) total order on non-join categories by setting, for two
    categories `A` and `B`, `A<B` if ``A._cmp_key > B._cmp_key``. This
    order in turn is used to give a normal form to join's, and help
    toward having a consistent method resolution order for
    parent/element classes.

    The comparison key should satisfy the following properties:

    - If A is a subcategory of B, then A < B. In particular,
      `Objects()` is the largest category.

    - If `A != B` and taking the join of `A` and `B` makes sense
      (e.g. taking the join of Algebras(GF(5)) and Algebras(QQ)
      does not make sense), then `A<B` or `B<A`.

    The rationale for the inversion above between `A<B` and
    ``A._cmp_key > B._cmp_key`` is that we want the order to
    be compatible with inclusion of categories, yet it's easier in
    practice to create keys that get bigger and bigger while we go
    down the category hierarchy.

    This implementation applies to join-irreducible categories
    (i.e. categories that are not join categories). It returns a
    pair of integers ``(flags, i)``, where ``flags`` is to be
    interpreted as a bit vector. The first bit is set if ``self``
    is a facade set. The second bit is set if ``self`` is finite.
    And so on. The choice of the flags is adhoc and was primarily
    crafted so that the order between categories would not change
    too much upon integration of :trac:`13589` and would be
    reasonably session independent. The number ``i`` is there
    to resolve ambiguities; it is session dependent, and is
    assigned increasingly when new categories are created.

    .. NOTE::

        This is currently not implemented using a
        :class:`lazy_attribute` for speed reasons only (the code is in
        Cython and takes advantage of the fact that Category objects
        always have a ``__dict__`` dictionary)

    Return the sorted input lists merged using the ``C3`` algorithm, with a twist.

    INPUT:

    - ``lists`` -- a non empty list (or iterable) of lists (or iterables), each sorted decreasingly according to ``key``
    - ``key`` -- a function

    OUTPUT: a pair ``(result, suggestion)``

    ``result`` is the sorted list obtained by merging the lists in
    ``lists`` while removing duplicate, and ``suggestion`` is a list
    such that applying ``C3`` on ``lists`` with its last list replaced
    by ``suggestion`` would return ``result``.

    EXAMPLES:

    With the following input, :func:`C3_merge` returns right away a sorted list::

        sage: from sage.misc.c3_controlled import C3_merge
        sage: C3_merge([[2],[1]])
        [2, 1]

    In that case, :func:`C3_sorted_merge` returns the same result,
    with the last line unchanged::

        sage: from sage.misc.c3_controlled import C3_sorted_merge
        sage: C3_sorted_merge([[2],[1]])
        ([2, 1], [1])

    On the other hand, with the following input, :func:`C3_merge`
    returns a non sorted list::

        sage: C3_merge([[1],[2]])
        [1, 2]

    Then, :func:`C3_sorted_merge` returns a sorted list, and suggests
    to replace the last line by ``[2,1]``::

        sage: C3_sorted_merge([[1],[2]])
        ([2, 1], [2, 1])

    And indeed ``C3_merge`` now returns the desired result::

        sage: C3_merge([[1],[2,1]])
        [2, 1]

    From now on, we use this little wrapper that checks that
    ``C3_merge``, with the suggestion of ``C3_sorted_merge``, returns
    a sorted list::

        sage: def C3_sorted_merge_check(lists):
        ....:     result, suggestion = C3_sorted_merge(lists)

        ....:     return result, suggestion

class HierarchyElement(object):
    """
    A class for elements in a hierarchy.

    This class is for testing and experimenting with various variants
    of the ``C3`` algorithm to compute a linear extension of the
    elements above an element in a hierarchy. Given the topic at hand,
    we use the following naming conventions. For `x` an element of the
    hierarchy, we call the elements just above `x` its *bases*, and
    the linear extension of all elements above `x` its *MRO*.

    By convention, the bases are given as lists of
    ``HierarchyElement`s, and MROs are given a list of the
    corresponding values.

    INPUT:

    - ``value`` -- an object
    - ``succ`` -- a successor function, poset or digraph from which
      one can recover the successors of ``value``
    - ``key`` -- a function taking values as input (default: the
      identity) this function is used to compute comparison keys for
      sorting elements of the hierarchy.

    .. NOTE::

        Constructing a HierarchyElement immediately constructs the
        whole hierarchy above it.

    See the introduction of this module :mod:`sage.misc.c3_controlled`
    for many examples. Here we consider a large example, originaly
