Linux package managers
======================

SageMath is available from various distributions and can be installed
by package managers.

See `the _sagemath dummy package <../reference/spkg/_sagemath.html>`_
for the names of packages that provide a standard installation of
SageMath, including documentation and Jupyter.

See also `repology.org: sagemath
<https://repology.org/project/sagemath/versions>`_ for information
about versions of SageMath packages in various distributions.
**Do not install a version of Sage older than 9.2.**
If you are on an older version of your distribution and a recent
version of SageMath is only available on a newer version of the
distribution, consider upgrading your distribution.

Gentoo users might want to give a try to
`sage-on-gentoo <https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo>`_.

The  :trac:`Trac wiki page Distribution <wiki/Distribution>` collects information
regarding packaging and distribution of SageMath.
