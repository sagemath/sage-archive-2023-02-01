Sage interface to Cremona's ``eclib`` library (also known as ``mwrank``)

This is the Sage interface to John Cremona's ``eclib`` C++ library for
arithmetic on elliptic curves.  The classes defined in this module
give Sage interpreter-level access to some of the functionality of
``eclib``.  For most purposes, it is not necessary to directly use these
classes. Instead, one can create an
:class:`EllipticCurve <sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.constructor.EllipticCurve>`
and call methods that are implemented using this module.

.. note::

   This interface is a direct library-level interface to ``eclib``,
   including the 2-descent program ``mwrank``.

TESTS:

Check that ``eclib`` is imported as needed::

    sage: [k for k in sys.modules if k.startswith("sage.libs.eclib")]
    []
    sage: EllipticCurve('11a1').mwrank_curve()
    y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10 x - 20
    sage: [k for k in sys.modules if k.startswith("sage.libs.eclib")]

class mwrank_EllipticCurve(SageObject):
    r"""
    The :class:`mwrank_EllipticCurve` class represents an elliptic
    curve using the ``Curvedata`` class from ``eclib``, called here an 'mwrank
    elliptic curve'.

    Create the mwrank elliptic curve with invariants
    ``ainvs``, which is a list of 5 or less *integers* `a_1`,
    `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4`, and `a_5`.

    If strictly less than 5 invariants are given, then the *first*
    ones are set to 0, so, e.g., ``[3,4]`` means `a_1=a_2=a_3=0` and
    `a_4=3`, `a_5=4`.

    INPUT:

    - ``ainvs`` (list or tuple) -- a list of 5 or less integers, the
      coefficients of a nonsingular Weierstrass equation.

    - ``verbose`` (bool, default ``False``) -- verbosity flag.  If ``True``,
      then all Selmer group computations will be verbose.

    EXAMPLES:

    We create the elliptic curve `y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 2x`::

        sage: e = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, 1, 1, -2, 0])
        sage: e.ainvs()
        [0, 1, 1, -2, 0]

    This example illustrates that omitted `a`-invariants default to `0`::

        sage: e = mwrank_EllipticCurve([3, -4])
        sage: e
        y^2 = x^3 + 3 x - 4
        sage: e.ainvs()
        [0, 0, 0, 3, -4]

    The entries of the input list are coerced to :class:`int`.
    If this is impossible, then an error is raised::

        sage: e = mwrank_EllipticCurve([3, -4.8]); e
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: ainvs must be a list or tuple of integers.

    When you enter a singular model you get an exception::

        sage: e = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, 0])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ArithmeticError: Invariants (= 0,0,0,0,0) do not describe an elliptic curve.

        If the curve has no 2-torsion, this is equal to the 2-Selmer

        the 2-rank of the torsion, since more information is gained
        from the 2-isogenous curve or curves.

        EXAMPLES:

        The following is the curve 960D1, which has rank 0,
        but Sha of order 4::

        In this case the rank was computed using a second descent,
        which is able to determine (by considering a 2-isogenous
        curve) that Sha is nontrivial.  If we deliberately stop the
        second descent, the rank bound is larger::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -900, -10098])
            sage: E.two_descent(second_descent = False, verbose=False)

            2

        In contrast, for the curve 571A, also with rank 0 and Sha
        of order 4, we only obtain an upper bound of 2::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, -929, -10595])
            sage: E.rank_bound()

        In this case the value returned by :meth:`rank()` is only a
        lower bound in general (though this is correct)::

            sage: E.rank()
            0
            sage: E.certain()
            False

    def selmer_rank(self):
        r"""
        Returns the rank of the 2-Selmer group of the curve.

        EXAMPLES:

        The following is the curve 960D1, which has rank 0, but Sha of
        order 4.  The 2-torsion has rank 2, and the Selmer rank is 3::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -900, -10098])
            sage: E.selmer_rank()
            3

        Nevertheless, we can obtain a tight upper bound on the rank
        since a second descent is performed which establishes the
        2-rank of Sha::

            sage: E.rank_bound()
            0

        To show that this was resolved using a second descent, we do
        the computation again but turn off ``second_descent``::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -900, -10098])
            sage: E.two_descent(second_descent = False, verbose=False)
            sage: E.rank_bound()
            2

        For the curve 571A, also with rank 0 and Sha of order 4,
        but with no 2-torsion, the Selmer rank is strictly greater
        than the rank::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, -929, -10595])
            sage: E.selmer_rank()
            2
            sage: E.rank_bound()
            2

        In cases like this with no 2-torsion, the rank upper bound is
        always equal to the 2-Selmer rank.  If we ask for the rank,
        all we get is a lower bound::

            sage: E.rank()
            0
            sage: E.certain()
            False

          In versions up to v20190909, ``eclib`` used floating point
          methods based on elliptic logarithms to divide points, and
          did not compute the precision necessary, which could cause
          failures. Since v20210310, ``eclib`` uses exact method based

           We emphasize that if this function returns ``True`` as the
           first return argument (``ok``), and if the default was used
           for the parameter ``max_prime``, then the points in the
           basis after calling this function are saturated at *all*
           primes, i.e., saturating at the primes up to ``max_prime``
           are sufficient to saturate at all primes.  Note that the
           function computes an upper bound for the index of
           saturation, and does no work for primes greater than this
           even if ``max_prime`` is larger.

            0.417143558758384

        Finally we finish the saturation.  The output here shows that
        the points are now provably saturated at all primes::

            done
            (True, 1, '[ ]')

        Of course, the :meth:`process()` function would have done all this
        automatically for us::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0,0,1,-7,6])
            sage: EQ = mwrank_MordellWeil(E)
            sage: EQ.process([[1547, -2967, 343], [2707496766203306, 864581029138191, 2969715140223272], [-13422227300, -49322830557, 12167000000]], saturation_bound=5)
            P1 = [1547:-2967:343]         is generator number 1

            sage: EQ.regulator()
            0.417143558758384

        But we would still need to use the :meth:`saturate()` function to
        verify that full saturation has been done::

            sage: EQ.saturate()
            saturating basis...Saturation index bound (for points of good reduction) = 3

            Points were proved 3-saturated (max q used = 13)
            done
            (True, 1, '[ ]')

        Note the output of the preceding command: it proves that the
        index of the points in their saturation is at most 3, then
        proves saturation at 2 and at 3, by reducing the points modulo
        all primes of good reduction up to 11, respectively 13.

           code adapted from a version of Michael Stoll's
           ``ratpoints`` program.  It would be preferable to use a
           newer version of ``ratpoints``.

        - ``verbose`` (bool, default ``False``) -- turn verbose operation on
          or off.

        EXAMPLES:

        A rank 3 example, where a very small search is sufficient to
        find a Mordell-Weil basis::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0,0,1,-7,6])
            sage: EQ = mwrank_MordellWeil(E)
            sage: EQ.search(1)
            P1 = [0:1:0]         is torsion point, order 1
            P1 = [-3:0:1]         is generator number 1
            ...
            P4 = [12:35:27]      = 1*P1 + -1*P2 + -1*P3 (mod torsion)
            sage: EQ
            Subgroup of Mordell-Weil group: [[1:-1:1], [-2:3:1], [-14:25:8]]

        In the next example, a search bound of 12 is needed to find a
        non-torsion point::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -18392, -1186248]) #1056g4
            sage: EQ = mwrank_MordellWeil(E)
            sage: EQ.search(11); EQ
            P1 = [0:1:0]         is torsion point, order 1
            P1 = [161:0:1]       is torsion point, order 2

            P1 = [161:0:1]       is torsion point, order 2
            P1 = [4413270:10381877:27000]         is generator number 1
