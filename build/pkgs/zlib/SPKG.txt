== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 None - previously it was necessary to remove binary *.obj files, but there
 are none in the current source package.

=== zlib-1.2.5 (David Kirkby, May 21st 2010) ===
 * Update to the latest upstream version - 1.2.5
 * Remove the patches directory.
 * Remove hacks for OSX
 * Remove the -fPIC flag from spkg-install, which was added so zlib
   worked properly on at least Debian on the Opteron processor. The
   -fPIC flag is added by the new zlib, so there is no need to add it
   in spkg-install. This has been tested on OS X, Linux and OpenSolaris.
   In each case, -fPIC gets added.
 * There was no need to remove object files *(.obj) are there
   are none in the latest source code.
