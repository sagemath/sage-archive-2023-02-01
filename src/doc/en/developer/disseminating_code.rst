Disseminating Code for Sage
===========================

Whether you have developed some new code for Sage or just have a
simple bug fix, you need to know how to communicate what you have
done to other Sage users. This part of the guide discusses this
issue. Here are some of the available avenues of communication and
tools to aid in that communication:

- The Google group ``sage-support``, at
  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support. This group gives help
  and support to those who have problems with Sage (installation,
  syntax, etc). The IRC channel ``#sage-devel`` on freenode serves the
  same purpose.

- The Google group ``sage-devel``, at
  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel. This mailing list is for
  Sage development and is about programming, design and technical
  issues. This is a great place to post questions about whether
  certain  behavior is a bug, or whether a certain feature ought to be
  implemented (or how it ought to be implemented), or similar issues.
  Also implementation issues are discussed here and the general
  direction of the project. Development discussion also takes place on
  the IRC channel ``#sage-devel`` on freenode.

- Mercurial: this is the source control system that is included
  with Sage. Use this to produce patches for Sage. See the chapter
  :ref:`chapter-walk-through` and the section
  :ref:`chapter-mercurial` for tutorials on using Mercurial to produce
  and manage patches.

- The Sage trac server, at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/.
  this is where you should post bugs, patches for bugs, additions to
  the Sage library, etc. See :ref:`chapter-trac` for more information.
