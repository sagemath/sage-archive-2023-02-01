Sage interface to Cremona's ``eclib`` library (also known as ``mwrank``)

This is the Sage interface to John Cremona's ``eclib`` C++ library for
arithmetic on elliptic curves.  The classes defined in this module
give Sage interpreter-level access to some of the functionality of
``eclib``.  For most purposes, it is not necessary to directly use these
classes. Instead, one can create an
:class:`EllipticCurve <sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.constructor.EllipticCurve>`
and call methods that are implemented using this module.

.. note::

   This interface is a direct library-level interface to ``eclib``,
   including the 2-descent program ``mwrank``.

class mwrank_EllipticCurve(SageObject):
    r"""
    The :class:`mwrank_EllipticCurve` class represents an elliptic
    curve using the ``Curvedata`` class from ``eclib``, called here an 'mwrank
    elliptic curve'.

    Create the mwrank elliptic curve with invariants
    ``ainvs``, which is a list of 5 or less *integers* `a_1`,
    `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4`, and `a_5`.

    If strictly less than 5 invariants are given, then the *first*
    ones are set to 0, so, e.g., ``[3,4]`` means `a_1=a_2=a_3=0` and
    `a_4=3`, `a_5=4`.

    INPUT:

    - ``ainvs`` (list or tuple) -- a list of 5 or less integers, the
      coefficients of a nonsingular Weierstrass equation.

    - ``verbose`` (bool, default ``False``) -- verbosity flag.  If ``True``,
      then all Selmer group computations will be verbose.

    EXAMPLES:

    We create the elliptic curve `y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 2x`::

        sage: e = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, 1, 1, -2, 0])
        sage: e.ainvs()
        [0, 1, 1, -2, 0]

    This example illustrates that omitted `a`-invariants default to `0`::

        sage: e = mwrank_EllipticCurve([3, -4])
        sage: e
        y^2 = x^3 + 3*x - 4
        sage: e.ainvs()
        [0, 0, 0, 3, -4]

    The entries of the input list are coerced to :class:`int`.
    If this is impossible, then an error is raised::

        sage: e = mwrank_EllipticCurve([3, -4.8]); e
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: ainvs must be a list or tuple of integers.

    When you enter a singular model you get an exception::

        sage: e = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, 0])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ArithmeticError: Invariants (= 0,0,0,0,0) do not describe an elliptic curve.

        Returns an upper bound for the rank of this curve, computed
        using :meth:`two_descent()`.

        If the curve has no 2-torsion, this is equal to the 2-Selmer
        rank.  If the curve has 2-torsion, the upper bound may be
        smaller than the bound obtained from the 2-Selmer rank minus
        the 2-rank of the torsion, since more information is gained
        from the 2-isogenous curve or curves.

        EXAMPLES:

        The following is the curve 960D1, which has rank 0,
        but Sha of order 4::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -900, -10098])
            sage: E.rank_bound()
            0
            sage: E.rank()
            0

        In this case the rank was computed using a second descent,
        which is able to determine (by considering a 2-isogenous
        curve) that Sha is nontrivial.  If we deliberately stop the
        second descent, the rank bound is larger::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -900, -10098])
            sage: E.two_descent(second_descent = False, verbose=False)
            sage: E.rank_bound()
            2

        In contrast, for the curve 571A, also with rank 0 and Sha
        of order 4, we only obtain an upper bound of 2::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, -929, -10595])
            sage: E.rank_bound()
            2

        In this case the value returned by :meth:`rank()` is only a
        lower bound in general (though this is correct)::

            sage: E.rank()
            0
            sage: E.certain()
            False

        """
        return self.__two_descent_data().getrankbound()

    def selmer_rank(self):
        r"""
        Returns the rank of the 2-Selmer group of the curve.

        EXAMPLES:

        The following is the curve 960D1, which has rank 0, but Sha of
        order 4.  The 2-torsion has rank 2, and the Selmer rank is 3::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -900, -10098])
            sage: E.selmer_rank()
            3

        Nevertheless, we can obtain a tight upper bound on the rank
        since a second descent is performed which establishes the
        2-rank of Sha::

            sage: E.rank_bound()
            0

        To show that this was resolved using a second descent, we do
        the computation again but turn off ``second_descent``::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 0, -900, -10098])
            sage: E.two_descent(second_descent = False, verbose=False)
            sage: E.rank_bound()
            2

        For the curve 571A, also with rank 0 and Sha of order 4,
        but with no 2-torsion, the Selmer rank is strictly greater
        than the rank::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, -929, -10595])
            sage: E.selmer_rank()
            2
            sage: E.rank_bound()
            2

        In cases like this with no 2-torsion, the rank upper bound is
        always equal to the 2-Selmer rank.  If we ask for the rank,
        all we get is a lower bound::

            sage: E.rank()
            0
            sage: E.certain()
            False

        Saturate this subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group.

        INPUT:

        - ``max_prime`` (int, default -1) -- saturation is performed for
          all primes up to ``max_prime``. If `-1` (the default), an
          upper bound is computed for the primes at which the subgroup
          may not be saturated, and this is used; however, if the
          computed bound is greater than a value set by the ``eclib``
          library (currently 97) then no saturation will be attempted
          at primes above this.

        - ``odd_primes_only`` (bool, default ``False``) -- only do
          saturation at odd primes.  (If the points have been found
          via :meth:``two_descent()`` they should already be 2-saturated.)

        OUTPUT:

        (3-tuple) (``ok``, ``index``, ``unsatlist``) where:

        - ``ok`` (bool) -- ``True`` if and only if the saturation was
          provably successful at all primes attempted.  If the default
          was used for ``max_prime`` and no warning was output about
          the computed saturation bound being too high, then ``True``
          indicates that the subgroup is saturated at *all*
          primes.

        - ``index`` (int) -- the index of the group generated by the
          original points in their saturation.

        - ``unsatlist`` (list of ints) -- list of primes at which
          saturation could not be proved or achieved.  Increasing the
          decimal precision should correct this, since it happens when
          a linear combination of the points appears to be a multiple
          of `p` but cannot be divided by `p`.  (Note that ``eclib``
          uses floating point methods based on elliptic logarithms to
          divide points.)

        .. note::

           We emphasize that if this function returns ``True`` as the
           first return argument (``ok``), and if the default was used for the
           parameter ``max_prime``, then the points in the basis after
           calling this function are saturated at *all* primes,
           i.e., saturating at the primes up to ``max_prime`` are
           sufficient to saturate at all primes.  Note that the
           function might not have needed to saturate at all primes up
           to ``max_prime``.  It has worked out what prime you need to
           saturate up to, and that prime might be smaller than ``max_prime``.

        .. note::

           Currently (May 2010), this does not remember the result of
           calling :meth:`search()`.  So calling :meth:`search()` up
           to height 20 then calling :meth:`saturate()` results in
           another search up to height 18.

        We initialise with three points which happen to be 2, 3 and 5
        times the generators of this rank 3 curve.  To prevent

        Finally we finish the saturation.  The output here shows that

            (True, 1, '[ ]')

        Of course, the :meth:`process()` function would have done all this
        automatically for us::

    def search(self, height_limit=18, verbose=False):
        r"""
        Search for new points, and add them to this subgroup of the
        Mordell-Weil group.

        INPUT:

        - ``height_limit`` (float, default: 18) -- search up to this
          logarithmic height.

        .. note::

          On 32-bit machines, this *must* be < 21.48 else
          `\exp(h_{\text{lim}}) > 2^{31}` and overflows.  On 64-bit machines, it
          must be *at most* 43.668.  However, this bound is a logarithmic
          bound and increasing it by just 1 increases the running time
          by (roughly) `\exp(1.5)=4.5`, so searching up to even 20
          takes a very long time.

        .. note::

           The search is carried out with a quadratic sieve, using
           code adapted from a version of Michael Stoll's
           ``ratpoints`` program.  It would be preferable to use a
           newer version of ``ratpoints``.

        - ``verbose`` (bool, default ``False``) -- turn verbose operation on
          or off.

        EXAMPLES:

        A rank 3 example, where a very small search is sufficient to
        find a Mordell-Weil basis::

            sage: E = mwrank_EllipticCurve([0,0,1,-7,6])
            sage: EQ = mwrank_MordellWeil(E)
            sage: EQ.search(1)
            P1 = [0:1:0]         is torsion point, order 1
            P1 = [-3:0:1]         is generator number 1
            ...
            P4 = [12:35:27]      = 1*P1 + -1*P2 + -1*P3 (mod torsion)
            sage: EQ
            Subgroup of Mordell-Weil group: [[1:-1:1], [-2:3:1], [-14:25:8]]

        non-torsion point::
