Families of Manifold Objects

The class :class:`ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily` is a subclass of :class:`FiniteFamily`
that provides an associative container of manifold objects, indexed by their
``_name`` attributes.

:class:`ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily` instances are totally ordered according
to their lexicographically ordered element names.

The subclass :class:`ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily` customizes the print
representation further.

    r"""
    Finite family of manifold objects, indexed by their names.

    The class :class:`ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily` inherits from
    :class:`FiniteFamily`.  Therefore it is an associative container.

    It provides specialized ``__repr__`` and ``_latex_`` methods.

    :class:`ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily` instances are totally ordered
    according to their lexicographically ordered element names.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.manifolds.family import ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily
        sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
        sage: A = M.subset('A')
        sage: B = M.subset('B')
        sage: C = B.subset('C')
        sage: F = ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily([A, B, C]); F
        Set {A, B, C} of objects of the 2-dimensional topological manifold M
        sage: latex(F)
        \{A, B, C\}
        sage: F['B']
        Subset B of the 2-dimensional topological manifold M

    All objects must have the same base manifold::

        sage: N = Manifold(2, 'N', structure='topological')
        sage: ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily([M, N])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: all objects must have the same manifold

    """
