    A subscript is a range of integers.  This function sorts a subscript
    in the sense of arranging it in ascending order.  The return values
    are the sign of the subscript and the sorted subscript, where the
    sign is defined as follows:

    #. sign == 0 if two or more entries in the subscript were equal.
    #. sign == +1, -1 if a positive (resp. negative) permutation was used to sort the subscript.

class DifferentialFormFormatter:
    r"""
    This class contains all the functionality to print a differential form in a
    graphically pleasing way.  This class is called by the ``_latex_`` and
    ``_repr_`` methods of the DifferentialForm class.

    In a nutshell (see the documentation of ``DifferentialForm`` for more
    details), differential forms are represented internally as a dictionary,
    where the keys are tuples representing the non-zero components of the
    form and the values are the component functions.  The methods of this
    class create string and latex representations out of the specification
    of a subscript and a component function.


    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.tensor.differential_form_element import DifferentialFormFormatter
        sage: x, y, z = var('x, y, z')
        sage: U = CoordinatePatch((x, y, z))

class DifferentialForm(AlgebraElement):
    r"""
    Differential form class.

    EXAMPLES:

    In order to instantiate differential forms of various degree, we begin
    by specifying the CoordinatePatch on which they live, as well as their
    parent DifferentialForms algebra.

    ::

        sage: x, y, z = var('x, y, z')
        sage: U = CoordinatePatch((x, y, z))
        sage: F = DifferentialForms(U)
        sage: form1 = DifferentialForm(F, 0, sin(x*y)); form1
        sin(x*y)

    In the previous example, we created a zero-form from a given function.
    To create forms of higher degree, we can use the subscript operator
    access the various components::

        sage: form2 = DifferentialForm(F, 1); form2
        0
        sage: form2[0] = 1
        sage: form2[1] = exp(cos(x))
        sage: form2[2] = 1/ln(y)
        sage: form2
        1/log(y)*dz + dx + e^cos(x)*dy

    We may calculate the exterior derivative of a form, and observe that
    applying the exterior derivative twice always yields zero::

        sage: dform = form1.diff(); dform
        y*cos(x*y)*dx + x*cos(x*y)*dy
        sage: dform.diff()
        0

    As can be seen from the previous example, the exterior derivative
    increases the degree of a form by one::

        sage: form2.degree()
        1
        sage: form2.diff().degree()
        2

    The ``d`` function provides a convenient shorthand for applying the
    diff member function.  Since d appears in other areas of mathematics
    as well, this function is not imported in the global namespace
    automatically::

        sage: from sage.tensor.differential_form_element import d
        sage: form2
        1/log(y)*dz + dx + e^cos(x)*dy
        sage: d(form2)
        -(1/y)/log(y)^2*dy/\dz + -e^cos(x)*sin(x)*dx/\dy
        sage: form2.diff()
        -(1/y)/log(y)^2*dy/\dz + -e^cos(x)*sin(x)*dx/\dy
        sage: d(form1) == form1.diff()
        True

    The wedge product of two forms can be computed by means of the wedge
    member function::

        sage: form1 = DifferentialForm(F, 2)
        sage: form1[0, 1] = exp(z); form1
        e^z*dx/\dy
        sage: form2 = DifferentialForm(F, 1)
        sage: form2[2] = exp(-z)
        sage: form1.wedge(form2)
        dx/\dy/\dz

    For this member function, there exists again a procedural function
    which is completely equivalent::

        sage: from sage.tensor.differential_form_element import wedge
        sage: form1.wedge(form2)
        dx/\dy/\dz
        sage: wedge(form1, form2)
        dx/\dy/\dz
        sage: form1.wedge(form2) == wedge(form1, form2)
        True


    NOTES:

        Differential forms are stored behind the screens as dictionaries,
        where the keys are the subscripts of the non-zero components, and
        the values are those components.

        For example, on a
        space with coordinates x, y, z, the form

            f = sin(x*y) dx /\\ dy + exp(z) dy /\\ dz

        would be represented as the dictionary

            {(0, 1): sin(x*y), (1, 2): exp(z)}.

        Most differential forms are ''sparse'' in the sense that most of
        their components are zero, so that this representation is more
        efficient than storing all of the components in a vector.
