Filtered Algebras With Basis

A filtered algebra with basis over a commutative ring `R`
is a filtered algebra over `R` endowed with the structure
of a filtered module with basis (with the same underlying
filtered-module structure). See
:class:`~sage.categories.filtered_algebras.FilteredAlgebras` and
:class:`~sage.categories.filtered_modules_with_basis.FilteredModulesWithBasis`
for these two notions.

    A filtered algebra with basis over a commutative ring `R`
    is a filtered algebra over `R` endowed with the structure
    of a filtered module with basis (with the same underlying

            See :class:`~sage.algebras.associated_graded.AssociatedGradedAlgebra`
            for the definition and the properties of this.

            If the filtered algebra ``self`` with basis is called `A`,
            then this method returns `\operatorname{gr} A`. The method
            :meth:`to_graded_conversion` returns the canonical
            `R`-module isomorphism `A \to \operatorname{gr} A` induced
            by the basis of `A`, and the method
            :meth:`from_graded_conversion` returns the inverse of this
            isomorphism. The method :meth:`projection` projects
            elements of `A` onto `\operatorname{gr} A` according to
            their place in the filtration on `A`.

            .. WARNING::

                When not overridden, this method returns the default
                implementation of an associated graded algebra --
                namely, ``AssociatedGradedAlgebra(self)``, where
                ``AssociatedGradedAlgebra`` is
                :class:`~sage.algebras.associated_graded.AssociatedGradedAlgebra`.
                But many instances of :class:`FilteredAlgebrasWithBasis`
                override this method, as the associated graded algebra
                often is (isomorphic) to a simpler object (for instance,
                the associated graded algebra of a graded algebra can be
                identified with the graded algebra itself). Generic code
                that uses associated graded algebras (such as the code
                of the :meth:`induced_graded_map` method below) should
                make sure to only communicate with them via the
                :meth:`to_graded_conversion`,
                :meth:`from_graded_conversion`, and
                :meth:`projection` methods (in particular,
                do not expect there to be a conversion from ``self``
                to ``self.graded_algebra()``; this currently does not
                work for Clifford algebras). Similarly, when
                overriding :meth:`graded_algebra`, make sure to
                accordingly redefine these three methods, unless their
                definitions below still apply to your case (this will
                happen whenever the basis of your :meth:`graded_algebra`
                has the same indexing set as ``self``, and the partition
                of this indexing set according to degree is the same as
                for ``self``).

            .. TODO::

                Maybe the thing about the conversion from ``self``
                to ``self.graded_algebra()`` on the Clifford at least
                could be made to work? (I would still warn the user
                against ASSUMING that it must work -- as there is
                probably no way to guarantee it in all cases, and
                we shouldn't require users to mess with
                element constructors.)

            **Example 3.**

            After having had a graded algebra as the codomain, let us try to
            have one as the domain instead. Our new ``f`` will go from ``h``
            to ``A``::

                sage: def map_on_basis(lam):  # redefining map_on_basis
                ....:     return x ** (sum(lam)) + y ** (len(lam))
                sage: f = h.module_morphism(on_basis=map_on_basis,
                ....:                       codomain=A)  # redefining f
                sage: f(h[1])
                U['x'] + U['y']
                sage: f(h[2])
                U['x']^2 + U['y']
                sage: f(h[1, 1])
                U['x']^2 + U['y']^2
                sage: f(h[2, 2])
                U['x']^4 + U['y']^2
                sage: f(h[3, 2, 1])
                U['x']^6 + U['y']^3
                sage: f(h.one())
                2
                sage: grf = h.induced_graded_map(A, f); grf
                Generic morphism:
                  From: Symmetric Functions over Rational Field
                   in the homogeneous basis
                  To:   Graded Algebra of An example of a filtered
                   algebra with basis: the universal enveloping
                   algebra of Lie algebra of RR^3 with cross
                   product over Rational Field
                sage: grf(h[1])
                bar(U['x']) + bar(U['y'])
                sage: grf(h[2])
                bar(U['x']^2)
                sage: grf(h[1, 1])
                bar(U['x']^2) + bar(U['y']^2)
                sage: grf(h[2, 2])
                bar(U['x']^4)
                sage: grf(h[3, 2, 1])
                bar(U['x']^6)
                sage: grf(h.one())
                2*bar(1)

            **Example 4.**

            The construct `\operatorname{gr} f` also makes sense when `f`
            is a filtration-preserving map between graded algebras. ::

                sage: def map_on_basis(lam):  # redefining map_on_basis
                ....:     return h[lam] + h[len(lam)]
                sage: f = h.module_morphism(on_basis=map_on_basis,
                ....:                       codomain=h)  # redefining f
                sage: f(h[1])
                2*h[1]
                sage: f(h[2])
                h[1] + h[2]
                sage: f(h[1, 1])
                h[1, 1] + h[2]
                sage: f(h[2, 1])
                h[2] + h[2, 1]
                sage: f(h.one())
                2*h[]
                sage: grf = h.induced_graded_map(h, f); grf
                Generic endomorphism of Symmetric Functions over Rational
                 Field in the homogeneous basis
                sage: grf(h[1])
                2*h[1]
                sage: grf(h[2])
                h[2]
                sage: grf(h[1, 1])
                h[1, 1] + h[2]
                sage: grf(h[2, 1])
                h[2, 1]
                sage: grf(h.one())
                2*h[]

            **Example 5.**

            For another example, let us compute `\operatorname{gr} f` for a
            map `f` between two Clifford algebras::

                sage: Q = QuadraticForm(ZZ, 2, [1,2,3])

                sage: m = Matrix(ZZ, [[1, 2], [1, -1]])
