From https://pypi.org/project/kiwisolver/

A fast implementation of the Cassowary constraint solver

Kiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint
solving algorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on
the seminal Cassowary paper. It is not a refactoring of the original C++
solver. Kiwi has been designed from the ground up to be lightweight and
fast. Kiwi ranges from 10x to 500x faster than the original Cassowary
solver with typical use cases gaining a 40x improvement. Memory savings
are consistently > 5x.

In addition to the C++ solver, Kiwi ships with hand-rolled Python
bindings.
