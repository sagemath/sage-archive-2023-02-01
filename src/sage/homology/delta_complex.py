This module implements the basic structure of finite
`\Delta`-complexes.  For full mathematical details, see Hatcher [Hat]_,
especially Section 2.1 and the Appendix on "Simplicial CW Structures".
As Hatcher points out, `\Delta`-complexes were first introduced by Eilenberg
and Zilber [EZ]_, although they called them "semi-simplicial complexes".

A `\Delta`-complex is a generalization of a :mod:`simplicial complex
<sage.homology.simplicial_complex>`; a `\Delta`-complex `X` consists
of sets `X_n` for each non-negative integer `n`, the elements of which
are called *n-simplices*, along with *face maps* between these sets of
simplices: for each `n` and for all `0 \leq i \leq n`, there are
functions `d_i` from `X_n` to `X_{n-1}`, with `d_i(s)` equal to the
`i`-th face of `s` for each simplex `s \in X_n`.  These maps must
satisfy the *simplicial identity*

  .. math::

    d_i d_j = d_{j-1} d_i \text{ for all } i<j.

Given a `\Delta`-complex, it has a *geometric realization*: a
topological space built by taking one topological `n`-simplex for each
element of `X_n`, and gluing them together as determined by the face
maps.

`\Delta`-complexes are an alternative to simplicial complexes.  Every
simplicial complex is automatically a `\Delta`-complex; in the other
direction, though, it seems in practice that one can often construct
`\Delta`-complex representations for spaces with many fewer simplices
than in a simplicial complex representation.  For example, the minimal
triangulation of a torus as a simplicial complex contains 14
triangles, 21 edges, and 7 vertices, while there is a `\Delta`-complex
representation of a torus using only 2 triangles, 3 edges, and 1
vertex.

.. note::

   This class derives from
   :class:`~sage.homology.cell_complex.GenericCellComplex`, and so
   inherits its methods.  Some of those methods are not listed here;
   see the :mod:`Generic Cell Complex <sage.homology.cell_complex>`
   page instead.

    Define a `\Delta`-complex.

    :param data: see below for a description of the options
    :param check_validity: If True, check that the simplicial identities hold.
    :type check_validity: boolean; optional, default True
    :return: a `\Delta`-complex

    Use ``data`` to define a `\Delta`-complex.  It may be in any of
    three forms:

    - ``data`` may be a dictionary indexed by simplices.  The value
      associated to a d-simplex `S` can be any of:

      - a list or tuple of (d-1)-simplices, where the ith entry is the
        ith face of S, given as a simplex,

      - another d-simplex `T`, in which case the ith face of `S` is
        declared to be the same as the ith face of `T`: `S` and `T`
        are glued along their entire boundary,

      - None or True or False or anything other than the previous two
        options, in which case the faces are just the ordinary faces
        of `S`.

      For example, consider the following::

        sage: n = 5
        sage: S5 = DeltaComplex({Simplex(n):True, Simplex(range(1,n+2)): Simplex(n)})
        sage: S5
        Delta complex with 6 vertices and 65 simplices

      The first entry in dictionary forming the argument to
      ``DeltaComplex`` says that there is an `n`-dimensional simplex
      with its ordinary boundary.  The second entry says that there is
      another simplex whose boundary is glued to that of the first
      one.  The resulting `\Delta`-complex is, of course, homeomorphic
      to an `n`-sphere, or actually a 5-sphere, since we defined `n`
      to be 5.  (Note that the second simplex here can be any
      `n`-dimensional simplex, as long as it is distinct from
      ``Simplex(n)``.)

      Let's compute its homology, and also compare it to the simplicial version::

        sage: S5.homology()
        {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: Z}
        sage: S5.f_vector()  # number of simplices in each dimension
        [1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 2]
        sage: simplicial_complexes.Sphere(5).f_vector()
        [1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7]

      Both contain a single (-1)-simplex, the empty simplex; other
      than that, the `\Delta`-complex version contains fewer simplices
      than the simplicial one in each dimension.

      To construct a torus, use::

        sage: torus_dict = {Simplex([0,1,2]): True,
        ....:        Simplex([3,4,5]): (Simplex([0,1]), Simplex([0,2]), Simplex([1,2])),
        ....:        Simplex([0,1]): (Simplex(0), Simplex(0)),
        ....:        Simplex([0,2]): (Simplex(0), Simplex(0)),
        ....:        Simplex([1,2]): (Simplex(0), Simplex(0)),
        ....:        Simplex(0): ()}
        sage: T = DeltaComplex(torus_dict); T
        Delta complex with 1 vertex and 7 simplices
        sage: T.cohomology(base_ring=QQ)
        {0: Vector space of dimension 0 over Rational Field,
         1: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field,
         2: Vector space of dimension 1 over Rational Field}

      This `\Delta`-complex consists of two triangles (given by
      ``Simplex([0,1,2])`` and ``Simplex([3,4,5])``); the boundary of
      the first is just its usual boundary: the 0th face is obtained
      by omitting the lowest numbered vertex, etc., and so the
      boundary consists of the edges ``[1,2]``, ``[0,2]``, and
      ``[0,1]``, in that order.  The boundary of the second is, on the
      one hand, computed the same way: the nth face is obtained by
      omitting the nth vertex.  On the other hand, the boundary is
      explicitly declared to be edges ``[0,1]``, ``[0,2]``, and
      ``[1,2]``, in that order.  This glues the second triangle to the
      first in the prescribed way.  The three edges each start and end
      at the single vertex, ``Simplex(0)``.

      .. image:: ../../media/torus_labelled.png

    - ``data`` may be nested lists or tuples.  The nth entry in the
      list is a list of the n-simplices in the complex, and each
      n-simplex is encoded as a list, the ith entry of which is its
      ith face.  Each face is represented by an integer, giving its
      index in the list of (n-1)-faces.  For example, consider this::

        sage: P = DeltaComplex( [ [(), ()],  [(1,0), (1,0), (0,0)],
        ....:                     [(1,0,2), (0, 1, 2)] ])

      The 0th entry in the list is ``[(), ()]``: there are two
      0-simplices, and their boundaries are empty.

      The 1st entry in the list is ``[(1,0), (1,0), (0,0)]``: there
      are three 1-simplices.  Two of them have boundary ``(1,0)``,
      which means that their 0th face is vertex 1 (in the list of
      vertices), and their 1st face is vertex 0.  The other edge has
      boundary ``(0,0)``, so it starts and ends at vertex 0.

      The 2nd entry in the list is ``[(1,0,2), (0,1,2)]``: there are
      two 2-simplices.  The first 2-simplex has boundary ``(1,0,2)``,
      meaning that its 0th face is edge 1 (in the list above), its 1st
      face is edge 0, and its 2nd face is edge 2; similarly for the
      2nd 2-simplex.

      If one draws two triangles and identifies them according to this
      description, the result is the real projective plane.

      .. image:: ../../media/rp2.png

      ::

        sage: P.homology(1)
        C2
        sage: P.cohomology(2)
        C2

      Closely related to this form for ``data`` is ``X.cells()``
      for a `\Delta`-complex ``X``: this is a dictionary, indexed by
      dimension ``d``, whose ``d``-th entry is a list of the
      ``d``-simplices, as a list::

        sage: P.cells()
        {-1: ((),),
         0: ((), ()),
         1: ((1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)),
         2: ((1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2))}

    - ``data`` may be a dictionary indexed by integers.  For each
      integer `n`, the entry with key `n` is the list of
      `n`-simplices: this is the same format as is output by the
      :meth:`cells` method. ::

        sage: P = DeltaComplex( [ [(), ()],  [(1,0), (1,0), (0,0)],
        ....:                     [(1,0,2), (0, 1, 2)] ])
        sage: cells_dict = P.cells()
        sage: cells_dict
        {-1: ((),),
         0: ((), ()),
         1: ((1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)),
         2: ((1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2))}
        sage: DeltaComplex(cells_dict)
        Delta complex with 2 vertices and 8 simplices
        sage: P == DeltaComplex(cells_dict)
        True

    Since `\Delta`-complexes are generalizations of simplicial
    complexes, any simplicial complex may be viewed as a
    `\Delta`-complex::

        sage: RP2 = simplicial_complexes.RealProjectivePlane()
        sage: RP2_delta = RP2.delta_complex()
        sage: RP2.f_vector()
        [1, 6, 15, 10]
        sage: RP2_delta.f_vector()
        [1, 6, 15, 10]

    Finally, `\Delta`-complex constructions for several familiar
    spaces are available as follows::

        sage: delta_complexes.Sphere(4)  # the 4-sphere
        Delta complex with 5 vertices and 33 simplices
        sage: delta_complexes.KleinBottle()
        Delta complex with 1 vertex and 7 simplices
        sage: delta_complexes.RealProjectivePlane()
        Delta complex with 2 vertices and 8 simplices

    Type ``delta_complexes.`` and then hit the TAB key to get the
    full list.

        The join of two `\Delta`-complexes `S` and `T` is the
        `\Delta`-complex `S*T` with simplices of the form `[v_0, ...,
        v_k, w_0, ..., w_n]` for all simplices `[v_0, ..., v_k]` in
        `S` and `[w_0, ..., w_n]` in `T`.  The faces are computed
        accordingly: the ith face of such a simplex is either `(d_i S)
        * T` if `i \leq k`, or `S * (d_{i-k-1} T)` if `i > k`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: T = delta_complexes.Torus()

           This does not check that self and other are manifolds.  It
           doesn't even check that their facets all have the same
           dimension.  It just chooses top-dimensional simplices from
           each complex, checks that they have the same dimension,
           removes them, and glues the remaining pieces together.
           Since a (more or less) random facet is chosen from each
           complex, this method may return random results if applied
           to non-manifolds, depending on which facet is chosen.

        ALGORITHM:

        Pick a top-dimensional simplex from each complex.  Check to
        see if there are any identifications on either simplex, using
        the :meth:`_is_glued` method.  If there are no
        identifications, remove the simplices and glue the remaining
        parts of complexes along their boundary.  If there are
        identifications on a simplex, subdivide it repeatedly (using
        :meth:`elementary_subdivision`) until some piece has no
        identifications.

    def elementary_subdivision(self, idx=-1):
        r"""
        Perform an "elementary subdivision" on a top-dimensional
        simplex in this `\Delta`-complex.  If the optional argument
        ``idx`` is present, it specifies the index (in the list of
        top-dimensional simplices) of the simplex to subdivide.  If
        not present, subdivide the last entry in this list.

        :param idx: index specifying which simplex to subdivide
        :type idx: integer; optional, default -1
        :return: `\Delta`-complex with one simplex subdivided.

        *Elementary subdivision* of a simplex means replacing that
        simplex with the cone on its boundary.  That is, given a
        `\Delta`-complex containing an `d`-simplex `S` with vertices
        `v_0`, ..., `v_d`, form a new `\Delta`-complex by

        - removing `S`
        - adding a vertex `w` (thought of as being in the interior of `S`)
        - adding all simplices with vertices `v_{i_0}`, ...,
          `v_{i_k}`, `w`, preserving any identifications present
          along the boundary of `S`

        The algorithm for achieving this uses
        :meth:`_epi_from_standard_simplex` to keep track of simplices
        (with multiplicity) and what their faces are: this method
        defines a surjection `\pi` from the standard `d`-simplex to
        `S`.  So first remove `S` and add a new vertex `w`, say at the
        end of the old list of vertices.  Then for each vertex `v` in
        the standard `d`-simplex, add an edge from `\pi(v)` to `w`;
        for each edge `(v_0, v_1)` in the standard `d`-simplex, add a
        triangle `(\pi(v_0), \pi(v_1), w)`, etc.

        Note that given an `n`-simplex `(v_0, v_1, ..., v_n)` in the
        standard `d`-simplex, the faces of the new `(n+1)`-simplex are
        given by removing vertices, one at a time, from `(\pi(v_0),
        ..., \pi(v_n), w)`.  These are either the image of the old
        `n`-simplex (if `w` is removed) or the various new
        `n`-simplices added in the previous dimension.  So keep track
        of what's added in dimension `n` for use in computing the
        faces in dimension `n+1`.

        In contrast with barycentric subdivision, note that only the
        interior of `S` has been changed; this allows for subdivision
        of a single top-dimensional simplex without subdividing every
        simplex in the complex.

        The term "elementary subdivison" is taken from p. 112 in John
        M. Lee's book [Lee]_.

        Algebraic topological model for this `\Delta`-complex with
        coefficients in ``base_ring``.

        The term "algebraic topological model" is defined by Pilarczyk
        and Réal [PR]_.

        INPUT:

        - ``base_ring`` - coefficient ring (optional, default
          ``QQ``). Must be a field.

        Denote by `C` the chain complex associated to this
        `\Delta`-complex. The algebraic topological model is a chain complex
        `M` with zero differential, with the same homology as `C`,
        along with chain maps `\pi: C \to M` and `\iota: M \to C`
        satisfying `\iota \pi = 1_M` and `\pi \iota` chain homotopic
        to `1_C`. The chain homotopy `\phi` must satisfy

        - `\phi \phi = 0`,
        - `\pi \phi = 0`,
        - `\phi \iota = 0`.

        Such a chain homotopy is called a *chain contraction*.

        OUTPUT: a pair consisting of

        - chain contraction ``phi`` associated to `C`, `M`, `\pi`, and
          `\iota`
        - the chain complex `M`

        Note that from the chain contraction ``phi``, one can recover the
        chain maps `\pi` and `\iota` via ``phi.pi()`` and
        ``phi.iota()``. Then one can recover `C` and `M` from, for
        example, ``phi.pi().domain()`` and ``phi.pi().codomain()``,
        respectively.
