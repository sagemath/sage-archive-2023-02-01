== Description ==

Givaro is a C++ library for arithmetic and algebraic computations. Its main features are implementations of the basic arithmetic of many mathematical entities: Primes fields, Extensions Fields, Finite Fields, Finite Rings, Polynomials, Algebraic numbers, Arbitrary precision integers and rationals (C++ wrappers over gmp) It also provides data-structures and templated classes for the manipulation of basic algebraic objects, such as vectors, matrices (dense, sparse, structured), univariate polynomials (and therefore recursive multivariate).

=== givaro-3.2.10.rc3.p2 (William Stein, May 16th, 2008) ===
 * Fix cygwin "missing logb declaration" problem.

=== givaro-3.2.10.rc3.p1 (Michael Abshoff, April 17th, 2008) ===
 * Fix Itanium specific gcc 4.3 build problem

=== givaro-3.2.10.rc3.p0 (Michael Abshoff, April 15th, 2008) ===
 * fix gcc 4.3 build - patch send upstream

=== givaro-3.2.10.rc3 (Michael Abshoff, March 15th, 2008) ===
  * update to upstream 3.2.10.rc3
  * add 64 bit OSX 10.5 support
  * remove all patches since they were integrated upstream
  * add spkg-check

=== givaro-3.2.10 (Clement Pernet, March 2nd, 2008)  ===
  * Updated to upstream 3.2.10
  * removed most patches
  * Note: this was based on 3.2.10.rc2

=== givaro-3.2.6.p5 (Michael Abshoff) ===
  * fix #1091. This copies over updated version of givintrsa.h,
    givintfactor.h and givintnumtheo.h into src/src/kernel/integer.
    I also keft the patch itself in the patches directory.

=== 2007-12-06 ===
  * include <cstring> in givaromm.C to fix gcc 4.3 issue

=== 2007-11-02 (Michael Abshoff) ===
  * apply rpw's work aorund for OSX 10.5
  * apply the same fix to givzpz32std.inl
  * add .hgignore

=== 2007-02-03 (Martin Albrecht) ===
  * new upstream release: 3.2.6
  * Changes to upstream (everything else below is irrelevant):
   ./src/library/poly1/givpoly1factor.h (2006-10-21 fix)
   ./src/kernel/zpz/givgfq.inl (2006-10-21 fix)
   ./src/kernel/zpz/givgfq.h  (2006-10-21 fix)
   ./aclocal.m4 64-bit (2006-10-29 fix)
   ./src/library/poly1/givpoly1padic.h (2006-11-09 fix)

=== 2006-12-15 William Stein ===
   * I don't know why, but I had to comment out "Rep& amxy( Rep& r, const Rep& a, const Rep& b, const Rep& c ) const { return Integer::amxy(r,a,b,c); }" in src/kernel/integer/givinteger.h in order to get Givaro to compile on my computer.  I'm guessing maybe amxy was deprecated from the C++ stl?

=== 2006-12-10 (Martin Albrecht) ===
 * delete[] not delete where new[] in GivaroMM

=== 2006-11-09 (Martin Albrecht) ===
 * GCC 4.0.0 on OSX PPC boxes doesn't seem to like "using Poly1Dom<Domain,Dense>::_domain" so we work around this in givpoly1padic.h

=== 2006-10-29 (Martin Albrecht) ===
  * replaced macro AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER with same macro from libtool 1.5.23a in aclocal.m4 to fix build on x86-64 systems as suggested by Kate Minola

=== 2006-10-21 (Martin Albrecht) ===
 * ported constructor with modulus parameter from linbox to givaro
 * added sage_generator() which returns the generator == cardinality if interpreted as an integer not a random one
