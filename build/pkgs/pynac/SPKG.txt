   autoreconf -i --force

in the src directory.

== Changelog ==

=== pynac-0.2.0.p5 (David Kirkby, 16th July, 2010) ===
 * #7861 Export CC="$CC -m64" and CXX="$CXX -m64" if
   SAGE64 is set to "yes". This is because setting
   CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to include the -m64 option was
   not sufficient to get this to build properly as 64-bit
   on Solaris 10 or OpenSolaris.
