Galois representations for elliptic curves over number fields

This file contains the code to compute for which primes the Galois
representation attached to an elliptic curve (over an arbitrary number field)
is surjective. The functions in this file are called by the ``is_surjective``
and ``non_surjective`` methods of an elliptic curve over a number field.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: K = NumberField(x**2 - 29, 'a'); a = K.gen()
    sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, 0, ((5 + a)/2)**2, 0, 0])
    sage: rho = E.galois_representation()
    sage: rho.is_surjective(29) # Cyclotomic character not surjective.
    False
    sage: rho.is_surjective(31) # See Section 5.10 of [Ser1972].
    True
    sage: rho.non_surjective()  # long time (4s on sage.math, 2014)
    [3, 5, 29]

    sage: E = EllipticCurve_from_j(1728).change_ring(K) # CM
    sage: E.galois_representation().non_surjective()  # long time (2s on sage.math, 2014)

class GaloisRepresentation(SageObject):
    r"""
    The compatible family of Galois representation
    attached to an elliptic curve over a number field.

    Given an elliptic curve `E` over a number field `K`
    and a rational prime number `p`, the `p^n`-torsion
    `E[p^n]` points of `E` is a representation of the
    absolute Galois group `G_K` of `K`. As `n` varies
    we obtain the Tate module `T_p E` which is
    a representation of `G_K` on a free `\ZZ_p`-module
    of rank `2`. As `p` varies the representations
    are compatible.

    Borel subgroup, by checking of traces of Frobenius.

    .. NOTE::

       This function will sometimes return primes for which the image
       is not contained in a Borel subgroup.  This issue cannot always
       be fixed by increasing patience as it may be a result of a
       failure of a local-global principle for isogenies.

    INPUT:

    - ``E`` -- EllipticCurve - over a number field.

    - ``L`` -- list - a list of prime numbers.

    - ``patience`` (int), default 100-- a positive integer bounding
      the number of traces of Frobenius to use while trying to prove
      irreducibility.

    OUTPUT:

    - list -- The list of all primes `\ell` in L for which the mod
      `\ell` image might be contained in a Borel subgroup of
      `GL_2(\mathbf{F}_{\ell})`.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1') # has a 5-isogeny

    Example to show that the output may contain primes where the
    representation is in fact reducible.  Over `\QQ` the following is
    essentially the unique such example by [Sut2012]_::

        sage: E = EllipticCurve_from_j(2268945/128)
        sage: sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.gal_reps_number_field.Frobenius_filter(E, [7, 11])

    This curve does possess a 7-isogeny modulo every prime of good
    reduction, but has no rational 7-isogeny::

def reducible_primes_naive(E, max_l=None, num_P=None, verbose=False):
    r"""
    Return locally reducible primes `\ell` up to ``max_l``.

    The list of primes `\ell` returned consists of all those up to
    ``max_l`` such that `E` mod `P` has an `\ell`-isogeny, where `K`
    is the base field of `E`, for ``num_P`` primes `P` of `K`.  In
    most cases `E` then has a `K`-rational `\ell`-isogeny, but there
    are rare exceptions.

    INPUT:

    - ``E`` -- an elliptic curve defined over a number field `K`

    - ``max_l`` (int or ``None`` (default)) -- the maximum prime
      `\ell` to test.

    - ``num_P`` (int or ``None`` (default)) -- the number of primes
      `P` of `K` to use in testing each `\ell`.
