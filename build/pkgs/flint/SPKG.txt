== Patches ==

 * dylib.patch: patch configure so that the shared library is called
   libflint.dylib on Darwin.
 * cflags.patch: patch configure so that "-m64" (and other potentially
   unwanted cflags) is not added on PowerPC G5. Also add -fno-common
   on Darwin, which is needed for OS X 10.4 and doesn't hurt on other
   systems.

== Changelog ==

  * Trac #12173: Update FLINT to version 2.3.
  * Removed obsolete patches.
  * Cleanup spkg-install and spkg-check scripts.
  * Removed Cygwin hack for libntl.a made useless by #9050.
  * Removed now useless patch --binary flag on Cygwin.
  * Only build shared library on Cygwin.

=== flint-1.5.2.p3 (Timo Kluck, 7 March 2013) ===
  * #14241: Fix double // path separators in longlong.patch

=== flint-1.5.2.p2 (Paul-Olivier Dehaye, 16 October 2012) ===
  * #9697: Remove the file 'src/zn_poly/demo/bernoulli/.DS_Store'

=== flint-1.5.2.p1 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 3 August 2012) ===
  * #13330: Pass --binary flag to patch on Cygwin to deal with file terminators
            mess.

=== flint-1.5.2.p0 (Dima Pasechnik, March 24th 2012) ===
  * bumped up the version to reflect the fact that we patch the source

=== flint-1.5.2 (Julien Puydt, William Stein, December 21st 2011) ===
  * #10328: enable ARM support; longlong.patch removes non-working
    asm code for 32-bit ARM

=== flint-1.5.0.p10 (Leif Leonhardy, October 11th 2011) ===
  * #9858: Add an upstream patch from FLINT 1.5.2 to make FLINT's test suite
    build (when `SAGE_CHECK=yes`) with MPIR 1.3.x, 2.x (cf. #8664) and GMP 5.x.
    The patch just substitutes deprecated random functions in one file
    (`fmpz-test.c`) which have been removed from the mentioned GMP / MPIR
    versions.

=== flint-1.5.0.p9 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, Dima Pasechnik, 25 August 2011) ===
  * Fix DOS file endings introduced in p7 which made patch fail on some systems

=== flint-1.5.0.p8 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, 12th July 2011) ===
  * Enable both libflint.dll and .so on Cygwin (see Trac 11547).
  * Use 'cp' rather than '$CP' (affects only Cygwin).
  * Remove '.svn' directories from upstream.

=== flint-1.5.0.p7 (Jeroen Demeyer, 6 July 2011) ===
 * Trac #11246: remove check for gcc version since we require gcc >= 4.0.1
   for Sage anyway.
 * Use `patch` instead of `cp` for patching the makefile
 * Remove test_gcc_version.sh and the horrible makepatchfiles
 * Check that `patch` succeeded in spkg-install, apply patches at -p1 level
 * Remove obsolete dist/debian directory

=== flint-1.5.0.p6 (Dima Pasechnik, 25th April 2011) ===
 * removed extraneous #include statements in ZmodF_mul.c, ZmodF_poly.c, and, mpn_extras.h, which
   triggered a clash of typedef for ulong in sys/types.h and #define ulong in flint.h
   on Cygwin (trac ticket 11246).

=== flint-1.5.0.p5 (David Kirkby, 19th June 2010) ===
 * #9277 Add -m64 flag when building the Flint test suite
   if SAGE64 is set to "yes". Otherwise it builds 32-bit
   objects and so the test files are not built, but instead
   generating the usual "WRONG ELF CLASS" error.
 * Remove a couple of lines which call spkg-check from
   spkg-install if SAGE_CHECK is set to "yes". Otherwise,
   spkg-check gets called twice, which is a waste of time.
   I'm afraid to say it was probably me that put those couple
   of lines in a year or two ago, before I realised how
   spkg-check was supposed to be called.

=== flint-1.5.0.p4 (Jaap Spies, Feb 23th, 2010) ===
 * #8112 Pass CFLAG64 to FLINT_TUNE if set for a 64 bit build.

=== flint-1.5.0.p3 (David Kirkby, January  2nd, 2010) ===
 * #7815 Changed makes and spkg-install so that the flag -m64 got
   added with a 64-bit build.

=== flint-1.5.0.p1 (William Stein, September 25th, 2009) ===
 * Included a cygwin fix that involves naming the library .dll instead of .so.

=== flint-1.5.0.p0 (Mike Hansen, September 25th, 2009) ===
 * Updated to 1.5.0.

=== flint-1.3.0p3 (Ondrej Certik, September 20th, 2009) ===
 *  Move libntl.a out of the way temporarily on CYGWIN (this makes the package
    built, because it will link to the .so lib instead)

=== flint-1.3.0p2 (David Kirkby, June 30th, 2009) ===
 *  Change '-a' to '-p' option spkg-install so flint installs
    on Solaris too. The usual GNUism. Only one byte is changed!

=== flint-1.3.0 (Nick Alexander, June 9th, 2009) ===
 * Update to latest upstream FLINT, 1.3.0.
