1. getline conflicts with a system-wide function name on
Cygwin.  So I changed it to getline0 in a whole bunch
of Mark's files.


2.
Modified Configure by changing line 66 to the following:
  if [ "$MACH" = "$x" -a `uname` = "Linux" ];

This seems right. Linux puts the FPU into extended precision
(64-bit mantissa), while all other OSs put it into normal double
precision --- so unless you run a programme that resets it,
you should get the desired precision.

One main difference between ec and sympow for moddeg is that the
former guesses that fewer terms will be needed to find the modular
degree, and thus the Euler product need not be expanded as
far. Changing this would make sympow about as fast, though ec is still
maybe 5% faster.

I currently have sympow's moddeg about 10% faster than ec it seems.
I will test it more thoroughly, and consider adding a "proof" option
(assuming c=1, etc.).
