PQ-Trees

This module implements PQ-Trees, a data structure use to represent all
permutations of the columns of a matrix which satisfy the *consecutive ones*
*property*:

  A binary matrix satisfies the *consecutive ones property* if the 1s are
  contiguous in each of its rows (or equivalently, if no row contains the regexp
  pattern `10^+1`).

  Alternatively, one can say that a sequence of sets `S_1,...,S_n` satisfies the
  *consecutive ones property* if for any `x` the indices of the sets containing
  `x` is an interval of `[1,n]`.

This module is used for the recognition of Interval Graphs (see
:meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.is_interval`).

**P-tree and Q-tree**


- A `P`-tree with children `c_1,...,c_k` (which can be `P`-trees, `Q`-trees, or
  actual sets of points) indicates that all `k!` permutations of the children
  are allowed.

  Example: `\{1,2\},\{3,4\},\{5,6\}` (disjoint sets can be permuted in any way)

- A `Q`-tree with children `c_1,...,c_k` (which can be `P`-trees, `Q`-trees, or
  actual sets of points) indicates that only two permutations of its children
  are allowed: `c_1,...,c_k` or `c_k,...,c_1`.

  Example: `\{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{3,4\},\{4,5\},\{5,6\}` (only two permutations of
  these sets have the *consecutive ones property*).

**Computation of all possible orderings**

#. In order to compute all permutations of a sequence of sets `S_1,...,S_k`
   satisfying the *consecutive ones property*, we initialize `T` as a `P`-tree
   whose children are all the `S_1,...,S_k`, thus representing the set of all
   `k!` permutations of them.

#. We select some element `x` and update the data structure `T` to restrict the
   permutations it describes to those that keep the occurrences of `x` on an
   interval of `[1,...,k]`. This will result in a new `P`-tree whose children
   are:

   * all `\bar c_x` sets `S_i` which do *not* contain `x`.
   * a new `P`-tree whose children are the `c_x` sets `S_i` containing `x`.

   This describes the set of all `c_x!\times \bar c'_x!` permutations of
   `S_1,...,S_k` that keep the sets containing `x` on an interval.

#. We take a second element `x'` and update the data structure `T` to restrict
   the permutations it describes to those that keep `x'` on an interval of
   `[1,...,k]`. The sets `S_1,...,S_k` belong to 4 categories:

   * The family `S_{00}` of sets which do not contain any of
     `x,x'`.

   * The family `S_{01}` of sets which contain `x'` but do not contain
     `x`.

   * The family `S_{10}` of sets which contain `x` but do not contain
     `x'`.

   * The family `S_{11}` of sets which contain `x'` and `x'`.

   With these notations, the permutations of `S_1,...,S_k` which keep the
   occurrences of `x` and `x'` on an interval are of two forms:

   * <some sets `S_{00}`>, <sets from `S_{10}`>, <sets from `S_{11}`>, <sets from `S_{01}`>, <other sets from `S_{00}`>
   * <some sets `S_{00}`>, <sets from `S_{01}`>, <sets from `S_{11}`>, <sets from `S_{10}`>, <other sets from `S_{00}`>

   These permutations can be modeled with the following `PQ`-tree:

   * A `P`-tree whose children are:

     * All sets from `S_{00}`
     * A `Q`-tree whose children are:

       * A `P`-tree with whose children are the sets from `S_{10}`
       * A `P`-tree with whose children are the sets from `S_{11}`
       * A `P`-tree with whose children are the sets from `S_{01}`

#. One at a time, we update the data structure with each element until they are
   all exhausted, or until we reach a proof that no permutation satisfying the
   *consecutive ones property* exists.

   Using these two types of tree, and exploring the different cases of
   intersection, it is possible to represent all the possible permutations of
   our sets satisfying our constraints, or to prove that no such ordering
   exists. This is the whole purpose of this module, and is explained with more
   details in many places, for example in the following document from Hajiaghayi
   [Haj]_.

        Updates ``self`` so that the sets containing ``v`` are

        INPUT:

        - ``v`` -- an element of the ground set

        OUTPUT:

        According to the cases :

            * ``(EMPTY, ALIGNED)`` if no set of the tree contains
              an occurrence of ``v``

              contain ``v``, all of which are aligned
              to the right of the ordering at the end when the function ends

            * ``(PARTIAL, UNALIGNED)`` if some (but not all) of the
              sets contain ``v``, though it is impossible to align them

        In any case, the sets containing ``v`` are contiguous when this

        raises a ``ValueError`` exception.
