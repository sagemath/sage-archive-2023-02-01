Tox
===

`Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is a popular package that is
used by a large number of Python projects as the standard entry point
for testing and linting.

Sage includes tox as a standard package and uses it for three purposes:

- For portability testing of the Sage distribution, as we explain in
  :ref:`chapter-portability_testing`.  This is configured in the file
  ``SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini``.

- For testing modularized distributions of the Sage library. This is configured
  in ``tox.ini`` files in subdirectories of ``SAGE_ROOT/pkgs/``, such as
  ``SAGE_ROOT/pkgs/sagemath-standard/tox.ini``. Each distribution's configuration
  defines tox environments for testing the distribution with different Python
  versions and different ways how the dependencies are provided.
  We explain this in :ref:`chapter-modularization`.

- As an entry point for testing and linting of the Sage library, as we describe below.
  This is configured in the file ``SAGE_ROOT/src/tox.ini``.

The tox configuration ``SAGE_ROOT/src/tox.ini`` can be invoked by using the command
``./sage --tox``.  (If ``tox`` is available in your system installation,
you can just type ``tox`` instead.)

This configuration provides an entry point for various testing/linting methods,
known as "tox environments".  We can type ``./sage --advanced`` to see what is
available::

  $ ./sage --advanced
  SageMath version 9.2
  ...
  Testing files:
  ...
  --tox [options] <files|dirs> -- general entry point for testing
                                  and linting of the Sage library
     -e <envlist>     -- run specific test environments
                         (default: run all except full pycodestyle)
        doctest                -- run the Sage doctester
                                  (same as "sage -t")
        coverage               -- give information about doctest coverage of files
                                  (same as "sage --coverage[all]")
        startuptime            -- display how long each component of Sage takes to start up
                                  (same as "sage --startuptime")
        pycodestyle-minimal    -- check against Sage's minimal style conventions
        relint                 -- check whether some forbidden patterns appear
                                  (includes all patchbot pattern-exclusion plugins)
        codespell              -- check for misspelled words in source code
        pycodestyle            -- check against the Python style conventions of PEP8
     -p auto          -- run test environments in parallel
     --help           -- show tox help


Doctest
=======

The command ``./sage -tox -e doctest`` requires that Sage has been
built already.  ``doctest`` is a special tox environment that runs the
Sage doctester in the normal Sage environment.  This is equivalent to
using the command ``./sage -t``; see :ref:`chapter-doctesting`.


Coverage
========

The command ``./sage -tox -e coverage`` requires that Sage has been
built already.  ``coverage`` is a special tox environment that is
equivalent to using the command ``./sage --coverageall`` (if no
arguments are provided) or ``./sage --coverage`` (if arguments are
provided).


Startuptime
===========

The command ``./sage -tox -e startuptime`` requires that Sage has been
built already.  ``startuptime`` is a special tox environment that is
equivalent to using the command ``./sage --startuptime``.


Pycodestyle
===========
`Pycodestyle <https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ (formerly known as pep8)
checks Python code against the style conventions of `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
Tox automatically installs pycodestyle in a separate virtual environment
on the first use.

Sage defines two configurations for pycodestyle.  The command ``./sage -tox -e pycodestyle-minimal`` uses
pycodestyle in a minimal configuration.
As of Sage 9.5, the entire Sage library conforms to this configuration::

  $ ./sage -tox -e pycodestyle-minimal -- src/sage/
  pycodestyle-minimal installed: pycodestyle==2.8.0
  pycodestyle-minimal run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='28778046'
  pycodestyle-minimal run-test: commands[0] | pycodestyle --select E401,E70,W605,E711,E712,E721 sage
  ___________ summary ____________
    pycodestyle-minimal: commands succeeded
    congratulations :)

When preparing a branch for a Sage ticket, developers should verify that ``./sage -tox -e
pycodestyle-minimal`` passes.  When the Sage patchbot runs on the ticket, it will perform similar
coding style checks; but running the check locally reduces the turnaround time from hours
to seconds.

The second configuration is used with the command ``./sage -tox -e pycodestyle`` and runs a
more thorough check::

  $ ./sage -tox -e pycodestyle -- src/sage/quadratic_forms/quadratic_form.py
  pycodestyle installed: pycodestyle==2.8.0
  pycodestyle run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='2520226550'

  ERROR:   pycodestyle: commands failed

When preparing a branch for a Sage ticket that adds new code,
developers should verify that ``./sage -tox -e pycodestyle`` does not
issue warnings for the added code.  This will avoid later cleanup
tickets as the Sage codebase is moving toward full PEP 8 compliance.

On the other hand, it is usually not advisable to mix coding-style
fixes with productive changes on the same ticket because this would
makes it harder for reviewers to evaluate the changes.

By passing the options ``--count -qq`` we can reduce the output to
only show the number of style violation warnings.  This can be helpful
for planning work on coding-style clean-up tickets that focus on one
or a few related issues::

  $ ./sage -tox -e pycodestyle -- --count -qq src/sage
  pycodestyle installed: pycodestyle==2.8.0
  pycodestyle run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='3166223974'

Pytest
======
`Pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_ is a testing framework.
It is included in the Sage distribution as an optional package.

Currently, Sage only makes very limited use of pytest, for testing the
package :mod:`sage.numerical.backends` and some modules in
:mod:`sage.manifolds`.

*Installation:*

- ``./sage -i pytest``.

*Usage:*

- Tox, Sage doctester: At the end of ``./sage -t`` (or ``./sage --tox -e doctest``), Pytest is automatically invoked.

- Manual: Run ``./sage -pytest path/to/the/test_file.py`` or ``./sage -pytest`` to run all tests.

- VS Code: Install the `Python extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_ and follow the `offical VS Code documentation <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing>`__.

*Configuration:* ``SAGE_ROOT/src/conftest.py``

*Documentation:* https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html

Pyright
=======
`Pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_ is static type checker.

*Installation:*

- (for manual use:) ``npm install -g pyright``, see `documentation <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright#installation>`__ for details.

*Usage:*

- Tox: Run ``./sage -tox -e pyright path/to/the/file.py``

- Manual: Run ``pyright path/to/the/file.py``

- VS Code: Install the `Pylance <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance>`__ extension.

*Configuration:* ``SAGE_ROOT/pyrightconfig.json``

*Documentation:* https://github.com/microsoft/pyright#documentation

Pyflakes
========
`Pyflakes <https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes>`_ checks for common coding errors.

LGTM
====
The website ``lgtm.com`` offers a detailed diagnostic about the global code quality and its evolution.

The reports can be found `here <https://lgtm.com/projects/g/sagemath/sage/>`_.

Our choice of configuration is made in ``.lgtm.yml``.
