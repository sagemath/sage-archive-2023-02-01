    Return the centrality betweenness of `G`

    The centrality betweenness of a vertex `v\in G` is defined by:

    .. MATH::

        c(v) = \sum_{s\neq v \neq t} \frac{\#\{\text{shortest } st-\text{paths containing v}\}}
                                          {\#\{\text{shortest } st-\text{paths}\}}

    For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Betweenness_centrality`.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a (di)graph

    - ``exact`` (boolean, default: ``False``) -- whether to compute over
      rationals or on ``double`` C variables.

    - ``normalize`` (boolean; default: ``True``) -- whether to renormalize the
      values by dividing them by `\binom {n-1} 2` (for graphs) or `2\binom {n-1}
      2` (for digraphs).

    ALGORITHM:

    To compute `c(v)`, we fix `s` and define `c_s(v)` as the centrality of `v`
    *due to* `s`, obtained from the formula above by running the sum over `t`
    only. We obtain `c(v)=\sum_{s\neq v} c_s(v)`.

    For every vertex `s`, we compute the value of `c_s(v)` for all `v`, using
    the following remark (see [Brandes01]_):

        Let `v_1,...,v_k` be the out-neighbors of `v` such that
        `dist(s,v_i)=dist(s,v)+1`. Then

        .. MATH::

            c_s(v) = \sum_{1\leq i \leq k} c_s(v_i)
                         \frac{\#\{\text{shortest } sv_i-\text{paths}\}}
                              {\#\{\text{shortest } sv  -\text{paths}\}}

    The number of shortest paths between `s` and every other vertex can be
    computed with a slightly modified BFS. While running this BFS we can also
    store the list of the vertices `v_1,...,v_k` associated with each `v`.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.graphs.centrality import centrality_betweenness
        sage: centrality_betweenness(digraphs.Circuit(6)) # abs tol 1e-10
        {0: 0.5, 1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5}
        sage: centrality_betweenness(graphs.CycleGraph(6)) # abs tol 1e-10
        {0: 0.2, 1: 0.2, 2: 0.2, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.2, 5: 0.2}

    Exact computations::

        sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().centrality_betweenness(exact=True)
        {0: 1/12, 1: 1/12, 2: 1/12, 3: 1/12, 4: 1/12, 5: 1/12, 6: 1/12, 7: 1/12, 8: 1/12, 9: 1/12}

    TESTS:

    Compare with NetworkX::

        sage: import networkx
        sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(100,.2)
        sage: nw = networkx.betweenness_centrality(g.networkx_graph(copy=False))
        sage: sg = centrality_betweenness(g)
        sage: max(abs(nw[x]-sg[x]) for x in g) # abs tol 1e-10
        0

    Stupid cases::

        sage: centrality_betweenness(Graph())
        {}
        sage: centrality_betweenness(Graph(2))
        {0: 0.0, 1: 0.0}

cdef void _estimate_reachable_vertices_dir(short_digraph g, int* reachL, int* reachU):
    r"""
    For each vertex ``v``, bounds the number of vertices reachable from ``v``.

    The lower bound is stored in reachL[v], while the upper bound is stored
    in reachU[v]. These two arrays must be pre-allocated and they must
    have size at least `n`, where `n` is the number of nodes of `g`.

    The estimate works as follows: first, we compute the graph of strongly
    connected components `\mathcal{G=(V,E)}`, then, for each SCC C, we set:

    .. MATH::

        L(C)=|C|+\max_{(C,C') \in \mathcal{E}}L(C') \\
        U(C)=|C|+\max_{(C,C') \in \mathcal{E}}L(C')

    By analyzing strongly connected components in reverse topologial order,
    we are sure that, as soon as we process component `C`, all components
    `C'` appearing on the right hand side have already been processed.
    A further improvement on these bounds is obtained by exactly computing
    the number of vertices reachable from the biggest strongly connected
    component, and handle this component separately.

    Then, for each vertex ``v``, we set ``reachL[v]=L(C)``, where ``C`` is
    the strongly connected component containing ``v``.

    this function and that should have size at least ``g.n``. At the end,
    ``reachL[v]`` (resp., ``reachU[v]``) will contain the lower (resp., upper)
    bound on the number of reachable vertices from ``v``.

def centrality_closeness_top_k(G, int k=1, int verbose=0):
    r"""
    Computes the k vertices with largest closeness centrality.

    The algorithm is based on performing a breadth-first-search (BFS) from each
    vertex, and to use bounds in order to cut these BFSes as soon as possible.
    If k is small, it is much more efficient than computing all centralities
    with :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.centrality_closeness`.
    Conversely, if k is close to the number of nodes, the running-time is
    approximately the same (it might even be a bit longer, because more
    computations are needed).
    For more information, see [BCM15]_. The algorithm does not work on
    weighted graphs.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` a Sage Graph or DiGraph;

    - ``k`` (integer, default: 1): the algorithm will return the ``k``
      vertices with largest closeness centrality. This value should be between
      1 and the number of vertices with positive (out)degree, because the
      closeness centrality is not defined for vertices with (out)degree 0. If
      ``k`` is bigger than this value, the output will contain all vertices
      of positive (out)degree.

    - ``verbose`` (integer, default: 0): an integer defining
      how "verbose" the algorithm should be. If
      0, nothing is printed, if 1, we print only the performance ratio at
      the end of the algorithm, if 2, we print partial results every 1000
      visits, if 3, we print partial results after every visit.

    OUTPUT:

    An ordered list of ``k`` pairs ``(closv, v)``, where ``v`` is one of the
    ``k`` most central vertices, and ``closv`` is its closeness centrality.
    If ``k`` is bigger than the number of vertices with positive (out)degree,
    the list might be smaller.
