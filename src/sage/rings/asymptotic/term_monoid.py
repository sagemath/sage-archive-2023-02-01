(Asymptotic) Term Monoids

This module implements asymptotic term monoids. The elements of these
monoids are used behind the scenes when performing calculations in an
:doc:`asymptotic ring <asymptotic_ring>`.

The monoids build upon the (asymptotic) growth groups. While growth
elements only model the growth of a function as it tends towards
infinity (or tends towards another fixed point; see
:doc:`growth_group` for more details), an
asymptotic term additionally specifies its "type" and performs the
actual arithmetic operations (multiplication and partial
addition/absorption of terms).

Besides an abstract base term :class:`GenericTerm`, this module
implements the following types of terms:

- :class:`OTerm` -- `O`-terms at infinity, see
  :wikipedia:`Big_O_notation`.
- :class:`TermWithCoefficient` -- abstract base class for
  asymptotic terms with coefficients.
- :class:`ExactTerm` -- this class represents a growth element
  multiplied with some non-zero coefficient from a coefficient ring.

A characteristic property of asymptotic terms is that some terms are
able to "absorb" other terms (see
:meth:`~sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid.GenericTerm.absorb`). For
instance, `O(x^2)` is able to absorb `O(x)` (with result
`O(x^2)`), and `3\cdot x^5` is able to absorb `-2\cdot x^5` (with result
`x^5`). Essentially, absorption can be interpreted as the
addition of "compatible" terms (partial addition).

.. _term_absorption:

Absorption of Asymptotic Terms
==============================

A characteristic property of asymptotic terms is that some terms are
able to "absorb" other terms. This is realized with the method
:meth:`~sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid.GenericTerm.absorb`.

For instance, `O(x^2)` is able to absorb `O(x)` (with result
`O(x^2)`). This is because the functions bounded by linear growth
are bounded by quadratic growth as well. Another example would be
that `3x^5` is able to absorb `-2x^5` (with result `x^5`), which
simply corresponds to addition.

Essentially, absorption can be interpreted
as the addition of "compatible" terms (partial addition).

We want to show step by step which terms can be absorbed
by which other terms. We start by defining the necessary
term monoids and some terms::

    sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid import OTermMonoid, ExactTermMonoid
    sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group import GrowthGroup
    sage: G = GrowthGroup('x^ZZ'); x = G.gen()
    sage: OT = OTermMonoid(growth_group=G, coefficient_ring=QQ)
    sage: ET = ExactTermMonoid(growth_group=G, coefficient_ring=QQ)
    sage: ot1 = OT(x); ot2 = OT(x^2)
    sage: et1 = ET(x^2, 2)

- Because of the definition of `O`-terms (see
  :wikipedia:`Big_O_notation`), :class:`OTerm` are able to absorb all
  other asymptotic terms with weaker or equal growth. In our
  implementation, this means that :class:`OTerm` is able to absorb
  other :class:`OTerm`, as well as :class:`ExactTerm`, as long as the
  growth of the other term is less than or equal to the growth of this
  element::

      sage: ot1, ot2
      (O(x), O(x^2))
      sage: ot1.can_absorb(ot2), ot2.can_absorb(ot1)
      (False, True)
      sage: et1
      2*x^2
      sage: ot1.can_absorb(et1)
      False
      sage: ot2.can_absorb(et1)
      True

  The result of this absorption always is the dominant
  (absorbing) :class:`OTerm`::

      sage: ot1.absorb(ot1)
      O(x)
      sage: ot2.absorb(ot1)
      O(x^2)
      sage: ot2.absorb(et1)
      O(x^2)

  These examples correspond to `O(x) + O(x) = O(x)`,
  `O(x^2) + O(x) = O(x^2)`, and `O(x^2) + 2x^2 = O(x^2)`.

- :class:`ExactTerm` can only absorb another
  :class:`ExactTerm` if the growth coincides with the
  growth of this element::

      sage: et1.can_absorb(ET(x^2, 5))
      True
      sage: any(et1.can_absorb(t) for t in [ot1, ot2])
      False

  As mentioned above, absorption directly corresponds
  to addition in this case::

      sage: et1.absorb(ET(x^2, 5))
      7*x^2

  When adding two exact terms, they might cancel out.
  For technical reasons, ``None`` is returned in this
  case::

      sage: ET(x^2, 5).can_absorb(ET(x^2, -5))
      True
      sage: ET(x^2, 5).absorb(ET(x^2, -5)) is None
      True

- The abstract base terms :class:`GenericTerm` and
  :class:`TermWithCoefficient` can neither absorb any
  other term, nor be absorbed by any other term.

If ``absorb`` is called on a term that cannot be absorbed, an
:python:`ArithmeticError<library/exceptions.html#exceptions.ArithmeticError>`
is raised::

    sage: ot1.absorb(ot2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ArithmeticError: O(x) cannot absorb O(x^2)

This would only work the other way around::

    sage: ot2.absorb(ot1)
    O(x^2)

Comparison
==========

The comparison of asymptotic terms with `\leq` is implemented as follows:

- When comparing ``t1 <= t2``, the coercion framework first tries to
  find a common parent for both terms. If this fails, ``False`` is
  returned.

- In case the coerced terms do not have a coefficient in their
  common parent (e.g. :class:`OTerm`), the growth of the two terms
  is compared.

- Otherwise, if the coerced terms have a coefficient (e.g.
  :class:`ExactTerm`), we compare whether ``t1`` has a growth that is
  strictly weaker than the growth of ``t2``. If so, we return
  ``True``. If the terms have equal growth, then we return ``True``
  if and only if the coefficients coincide as well.

  In all other cases, we return ``False``.

Long story short: we consider terms with different coefficients that
have equal growth to be incomparable.


Various
=======

.. TODO::

    - Implementation of more term types (e.g. `L` terms,
      `\Omega` terms, `o` terms, `\Theta` terms).

            Setting ``check`` to ``False`` is meant to be used in

            (in order to avoid duplicate checking).

            For a more detailed explanation of the *absorption* of
            asymptotic terms see
            the :ref:`module description <term_absorption>`.

        EXAMPLES:

        We want to demonstrate in which cases an asymptotic term
        is able to absorb another term, as well as explain the output
        of this operation. We start by defining some parents and
        elements::

            sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group import GrowthGroup
            sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid import TermMonoid
            sage: G_QQ = GrowthGroup('x^QQ'); x = G_QQ.gen()
            sage: OT = TermMonoid('O', G_QQ, coefficient_ring=ZZ)
            sage: ET = TermMonoid('exact', G_QQ, coefficient_ring=QQ)
            sage: ot1 = OT(x); ot2 = OT(x^2)
            sage: et1 = ET(x, 100); et2 = ET(x^2, 2)
            sage: et3 = ET(x^2, 1); et4 = ET(x^2, -2)

        `O`-Terms are able to absorb other `O`-terms and exact terms
        with weaker or equal growth. ::

            sage: ot1.absorb(ot1)
            O(x)
            sage: ot1.absorb(et1)
            O(x)
            sage: ot1.absorb(et1) is ot1
            True

        :class:`ExactTerm` is able to absorb another
        :class:`ExactTerm` if the terms have the same growth. In this
        case, *absorption* is nothing else than an addition of the
        respective coefficients::

            sage: et2.absorb(et3)
            3*x^2
            sage: et3.absorb(et2)
            3*x^2
            sage: et3.absorb(et4)
            -x^2

        Note that, for technical reasons, the coefficient `0` is not
        allowed, and thus ``None`` is returned if two exact terms
        cancel each other out::

            sage: et2.absorb(et4)
            sage: et4.absorb(et2) is None
            True

        TESTS:

        When disabling the ``check`` flag, absorb might produce
        wrong results::

            sage: et1.absorb(ot2, check=False)
            O(x)
        """
        from sage.structure.element import have_same_parent

                raise ArithmeticError('%s cannot absorb %s' % (self, other))

        if have_same_parent(self, other):
            return self._absorb_(other)

        return get_coercion_model().bin_op(self, other,

        A boolean.

        .. NOTE::

            This method **only** compares the growth of the input
            terms!

        EXAMPLES:

        First, we define some asymptotic terms (and their parents)::

            sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group import GrowthGroup
            sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid import (GenericTermMonoid, TermMonoid)
            sage: G = GrowthGroup('x^ZZ'); x = G.gen()
            sage: GT = GenericTermMonoid(G, QQ)
            sage: OT = TermMonoid('O', G, QQ)
            sage: ET_ZZ = TermMonoid('exact', G, ZZ)
            sage: ET_QQ = TermMonoid('exact', G, QQ)
            sage: g1 = GT(x); g2 = GT(x^2); g1, g2
            (Generic Term with growth x, Generic Term with growth x^2)
            sage: o1 = OT(x^-1); o2 = OT(x^3); o1, o2
            (O(x^(-1)), O(x^3))
            sage: t1 = ET_ZZ(x^2, 5); t2 = ET_QQ(x^3, 2/7); t1, t2
            (5*x^2, 2/7*x^3)

        In order for the comparison to work, the terms have come from
        or coerce into the same parent. In particular, comparing
        :class:`GenericTerm` to, for example, an :class:`OTerm`
        always yields ``False``::

            sage: g1 <= g2
            True
            sage: o1, g1
            (O(x^(-1)), Generic Term with growth x)
            sage: o1 <= g1
            False

        If the elements of the common parent do not possess
        coefficients, then only the growth is compared::

            sage: o1 <= o1
            True
            sage: o1 <= o2
            True
            sage: o1 <= t1 and t1 <= o2
            True

        For terms with coefficient (like exact terms), comparison
        works similarly, with the sole exception that terms with
        equal growth are considered incomparable. Thus, `\leq`
        only holds if the coefficients are equal as well::

            sage: t1 <= t2
            True
            sage: ET_ZZ(x, -5) <= ET_ZZ(x, 42)
            False
            sage: ET_ZZ(x, 5) <= ET_ZZ(x, 5)

    INPUT:

    - ``growth_group`` -- a growth group (i.e. an instance of
      :class:`~sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group.GenericGrowthGroup`).

    - ``coefficient_ring`` -- a ring which contains the (maybe implicit)
      coefficients of the elements.

    - ``category`` -- The category of the parent can be specified
      in order to broaden the base structure. It has to be a subcategory
      of ``Join of Category of Monoids and Category of posets``. This
      is also the default category if ``None`` is specified.

    In this class the base
    structure for asymptotic term monoids will be handled. These
    monoids are the parents of asymptotic terms (for example, see
    :class:`GenericTerm` or :class:`OTerm`). Basically, asymptotic
    terms consist of a ``growth`` (which is an asymptotic growth
    group element, for example
    :class:`~sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group.MonomialGrowthElement`);
    additional structure and properties are added by the classes inherited
    from :class:`GenericTermMonoid`.

        In order for two terms to be compared, a coercion into

        In this case, this works because ``T_ZZ``, the parent of
        ``term1``, coerces into ``T_QQ``::

        sage: ET = ExactTermMonoid(G, QQ)

    Asymptotic exact terms may be multiplied (with the usual rules
    applying)::

        sage: ET(x^2, 3) * ET(x, -1)
        -3*x^3
        sage: ET(x^0, 4) * ET(x^5, 2)

        sage: ET(x^2, 42) * OT(x)
        O(x^3)

        sage: ET(x^2, 5).absorb(ET(x^2, 1))
        6*x^2

    Note that, as for technical reasons, `0` is not allowed as a
    coefficient for an asymptotic term with coefficient. Instead ``None``
    is returned if two asymptotic exact terms cancel out each other
    during absorption::

        sage: ET(x^2, 42).can_absorb(ET(x^2, -42))
