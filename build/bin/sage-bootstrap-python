# Trac #29890: Our first choice is "python", not "python3". This is to avoid
# a defect of sage_bootstrap on macOS regarding SSL URLs.

# Trac #30177: Also check for hashlib.sha1 to guard against broken python2
# from old homebrew installations.  Also check whether the current directory
# is accessible by this python; this is to guard on Cygwin against Pythons
# installed somewhere else in Windows.

# Trac #29285: Do not accept pythons that manipulate PATH, such as
# the shims provided by pyenv.

# Trac #30008: Make it work even if the environment tries to sabotage UTF-8
# operation in Python 3.0.x-3.6.x by setting LC_ALL=C or similar.
