class PolyhedralComplex(GenericCellComplex):
    r"""
    A polyhedral complex.

    A **polyhedral complex** `PC` is a collection of polyhedra in a certain
    ambient space `\RR^n` such that the following hold.

    - If a polyhedron `P` is in `PC`, then all the faces of `P` are in `PC`.

    - If polyhedra `P` and `Q` are in `PC`, then `P \cap Q` is either empty
      or a face of both `P` and `Q`.

    In this context, a "polyhedron" means the geometric realization
    of a polyhedron. This is in contrast to :mod:`simplicial complex
    <sage.topology.simplicial_complex>`, whose cells are abstract simplices.
    The concept of a polyhedral complex generalizes that of a **geometric**
    simplicial complex.

    .. NOTE::

       This class derives from
       :class:`~sage.topology.cell_complex.GenericCellComplex`, and so
       inherits its methods.  Some of those methods are not listed here;
       see the :mod:`Generic Cell Complex <sage.topology.cell_complex>`
       page instead.

    INPUT:

    - ``maximal_cells`` -- a list, a tuple, or a dictionary (indexed by
      dimension) of cells of the Complex. Each cell is of class
      :class:`Polyhedron` of the same ambient dimension. To set up a
      :class:PolyhedralComplex, it is sufficient to provide the maximal
      faces. Use keyword argument ``partial=True`` to set up a partial
      polyhedral complex, which is a subset of the faces (viewed as
      relatively open) of a polyhedral complex that is not necessarily
      closed under taking intersection.

    - ``maximality_check`` -- boolean (default: ``True``);
      if ``True``, then the constructor checks that each given
      maximal cell is indeed maximal, and ignores those that are not

    - ``face_to_face_check`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);
      if ``True``, then the constructor checks whether the cells
      are face-to-face, and it raises a ``ValueError`` if they are not

    - ``is_mutable`` and ``is_immutable`` -- boolean (default: ``True`` and
      ``False`` respectively); set ``is_mutable=False`` or ``is_immutable=True``
      to make this polyhedral complex immutable

    - ``backend`` -- string (optional); the name of the backend used for
      computations on Sage polyhedra; if it is not given, then each cell has
      its own backend; otherwise it must be one of the following:

      * ``'ppl'`` - the Parma Polyhedra Library

      * ``'cdd'`` - CDD

      * ``'normaliz'`` - normaliz

      * ``'polymake'`` - polymake

      * ``'field'`` - a generic Sage implementation

    - ``ambient_dim`` -- integer (optional); used to set up an empty
      complex in the intended ambient space

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: pc = PolyhedralComplex([
        ....:         Polyhedron(vertices=[(1/3, 1/3), (0, 0), (1/7, 2/7)]),
