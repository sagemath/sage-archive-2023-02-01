High-Level Interface
--------------------
Valuations can be defined conveniently on some Sage rings such as p-adic rings
and function fields.

p-adic valuations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valuations on number fields can be easily specified if they uniquely extend
the valuation of a rational prime::

    sage: v = QQ.valuation(2)
    sage: v(1024)
    10

They are normalized such that the rational prime has valuation 1::

    sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)
    sage: v = K.valuation(2)
    sage: v(1024)
    10

If there are multiple valuations over a prime, they can be obtained by
extending a valuation from a smaller ring::

    sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + x + 1)
    sage: K.valuation(7)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: The valuation Gauss valuation induced by 7-adic valuation does not approximate a unique extension of 7-adic valuation with respect to x^2 + x + 1
    sage: w,ww = QQ.valuation(7).extensions(K)
    sage: w(a + 3), ww(a + 3)
    (1, 0)
    sage: w(a + 5), ww(a + 5)
    (0, 1)

Valuations on Function Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Similarly, valuations can be defined on function fields::

    sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: v = K.valuation(x)
    sage: v(1/x)
    -1
    
    sage: v = K.valuation(1/x)
    sage: v(1/x)
    1

On extensions of function fields, valuations can be created by providing a
prime on the underlying rational function field when the extension is unique::

    sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: R.<y> = K[]
    sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
    sage: v = L.valuation(x)
    sage: v(x)
    1

Valuations can also be extended from smaller function fields::

    sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: v = K.valuation(x - 4)
    sage: R.<y> = K[]
    sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
    sage: v.extensions(L)
    [[ (x - 4)-adic valuation, v(y + 2) = 1 ]-adic valuation,
     [ (x - 4)-adic valuation, v(y - 2) = 1 ]-adic valuation]

Low-Level Interface
-------------------

Mac Lane valuations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Internally, all the above is backed by the algorithms described in
[Mac1936I]_ and [Mac1936II]_. Let us consider the extensions of
``K.valuation(x - 4)`` to the field `L` above to outline how this works
internally.

First, the valuation on `K` is induced by a valuation on `\QQ[x]`. To construct
this valuation, we start from the trivial valuation on `\\Q` and consider its
induced Gauss valuation on `\\Q[x]`, i.e., the valuation that assigns to a
polynomial the minimum of the coefficient valuations::

    sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: v = GaussValuation(R, valuations.TrivialValuation(QQ))
    
The Gauss valuation can be augmented by specifying that `x - 4` has valuation 1::

    sage: v = v.augmentation(x - 4, 1); v
    [ Gauss valuation induced by Trivial valuation on Rational Field, v(x - 4) = 1 ]

This valuation then extends uniquely to the fraction field::

    sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: v = v.extension(K); v
    (x - 4)-adic valuation

Over the function field we repeat the above process, i.e., we define the Gauss
valuation induced by it and augment it to approximate an extension to `L`::

    sage: R.<y> = K[]
    sage: w = GaussValuation(R, v)
    sage: w = w.augmentation(y - 2, 1); w
    [ Gauss valuation induced by (x - 4)-adic valuation, v(y - 2) = 1 ]
    sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
    sage: ww = w.extension(L); ww
    [ (x - 4)-adic valuation, v(y - 2) = 1 ]-adic valuation

Limit valuations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the previous example the final valuation ``ww`` is not merely given by
evaluating ``w`` on the ring `K[y]`::

    sage: ww(y^2 - x)
    +Infinity
    sage: y = R.gen()
    sage: w(y^2 - x)
    1

Instead ``ww`` is given by a limit, i.e., an infinite sequence of
augmentations of valuations::

    sage: ww._base_valuation
    [ Gauss valuation induced by (x - 4)-adic valuation, v(y - 2) = 1 , … ]

The terms of this infinite sequence are computed on demand::

    sage: ww._base_valuation._approximation
    [ Gauss valuation induced by (x - 4)-adic valuation, v(y - 2) = 1 ]
    sage: ww(y - 1/4*x - 1)
    2
    sage: ww._base_valuation._approximation
    [ Gauss valuation induced by (x - 4)-adic valuation, v(y + 1/64*x^2 - 3/8*x - 3/4) = 3 ]

Non-classical valuations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using the low-level interface we are not limited to classical valuations on
function fields that correspond to points on the corresponding projective
curves. Instead we can start with a non-trivial valuation on the field of
constants::

    sage: v = QQ.valuation(2)
    sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: w = GaussValuation(R, v) # v is not trivial
    sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: w = w.extension(K)
    sage: w.residue_field()
    Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2

Mac Lane Approximants
---------------------
The main tool underlying this package is an algorithm by Mac Lane to compute,
starting from a Gauss valuation on a polynomial ring and a monic squarefree
polynomial G, approximations to the limit valuation which send G to infinity::

    sage: v = QQ.valuation(2)
    sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: f = x^5 + 3*x^4 + 5*x^3 + 8*x^2 + 6*x + 12
    sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(f) # random output (order may vary)
    [[ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x^2 + x + 1) = 3 ],
     [ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x) = 1/2 ],
     [ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x) = 1 ]]

From these approximants one can already see the residual degrees and
ramification indices of the corresponding extensions. The approximants can be
pushed to arbitrary precision, corresponding to a factorization of ``f``::

    sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(f, required_precision=10) # random output
    [[ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x^2 + 193*x + 13/21) = 10 ],
     [ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x + 86) = 10 ],
     [ Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation, v(x) = 1/2, v(x^2 + 36/11*x + 2/17) = 11 ]]
