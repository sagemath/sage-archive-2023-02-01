Valuations which are defined as limits of valuations.

The discrete valuation of a complete field extends uniquely to a finite field
extension. This is not the case anymore for fields which are not complete with
respect to their discrete valuation. In this case, the extensions essentially
correspond to the factors of the defining polynomial of the extension over the
completion. However, these factors only exist over the completion and this
makes it difficult to write down such valuations with a representation of
finite length.

More specifically, let `v` be a discrete valuation on `K` and let `L=K[x]/(G)`
a finite extension thereof. An extension of `v` to `L` can be represented as a
discrete pseudo-valuation `w'` on `K[x]` which sends `G` to infinity.
However, such `w'` might not be described by an :mod:`augmented valuation <sage.rings.valuation.augmented_valuation>`
over a :mod:`Gauss valuation <sage.rings.valuation.gauss_valuation>` anymore. Instead, we may need to write is as a
limit of augmented valuations.

The classes in this module provide the means of writing down such limits and
resulting valuations on quotients.

EXAMPLES:

In this function field, the unique place of ``K`` which corresponds to the zero
point has two extensions to ``L``. The valuations corresponding to these
extensions can only be approximated::

    sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: R.<y> = K[]
    sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)

    sage: v = K.valuation(1)
    sage: w = v.extensions(L); w
    [[ (x - 1)-adic valuation, v(y + 1) = 1 ]-adic valuation,
     [ (x - 1)-adic valuation, v(y - 1) = 1 ]-adic valuation]

The same phenomenon can be observed for valuations on number fields::

    sage: K = QQ
    sage: R.<t> = K[]
    sage: L.<t> = K.extension(t^2 + 1)
    sage: v = QQ.valuation(5)
    sage: w = v.extensions(L); w
    [[ 5-adic valuation, v(t + 2) = 1 ]-adic valuation,
     [ 5-adic valuation, v(t + 3) = 1 ]-adic valuation]

.. NOTE::

    We often rely on approximations of valuations even if we could represent the
    valuation without using a limit. This is done to improve performance as many
    computations already can be done correctly with an approximation::

        sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
        sage: R.<y> = K[]
        sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)

        sage: v = K.valuation(1/x)
        sage: w = v.extension(L); w
        Valuation at the infinite place
        sage: w._base_valuation._base_valuation._improve_approximation()
        sage: w._base_valuation._base_valuation._approximation
        [ Gauss valuation induced by Valuation at the infinite place, v(y) = 1/2, v(y^2 - 1/x) = +Infinity ]

class LimitValuationFactory(UniqueFactory):
    r"""
    Return a limit valuation which sends the polynomial ``G`` to infinity and
    is greater than or equal than ``base_valuation``.

    INPUT:

    - ``base_valuation`` -- a discrete (pseudo-)valuation on a polynomial ring
      which is a discrete valuation on the coefficient ring which can be
      uniquely augmented (possibly only in the limit) to a pseudo-valuation
      that sends ``G`` to infinity.

    - ``G`` -- a squarefree polynomial in the domain of ``base_valuation``.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
        sage: v = GaussValuation(R, QQ.valuation(2))
        sage: w = valuations.LimitValuation(v, x)

        EXAMPLES:

        Note that this does not normalize ``base_valuation`` in any way. It is
        easily possible to create the same limit in two different ways::

            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]

            sage: u = valuations.LimitValuation(v, x)
            sage: u == w
            False

        The point here is that this is not meant to be invoked from user code.
        But mostly from other factories which have made sure that the
        parameters are normalized already.

        Replace our approximation with a sufficiently precise approximation to
        correctly compute the valuation of ``f``.

        EXAMPLES:

        In this examples, the approximation is increased unnecessarily. The
        first approximation would have been precise enough to compute the
        valuation of ``t + 2``. However, it is faster to improve the
        approximation (perform one step of the Mac Lane algorithm) than to
        check for this::

            sage: u._approximation
            [ Gauss valuation induced by 5-adic valuation, v(t + 7) = 2 ]

        ALGORITHM:

            Write `L=K[x]/(G)` and consider `g` a representative of the class
            of ``f`` in `K[x]` (of minimal degree.) Write `v` for
            ``self._approximation` and `\phi` for the last key polynomial of
            `v`. With repeated quotient and remainder `g` has a unique
            expansion as `g=\sum a_i\phi^i`.  Suppose that `g` is an
            equivalence-unit with respect to ``self._approximation``, i.e.,
            `v(a_0) < v(a_i\phi^i)` for all `i\ne 0`. If we denote the limit
            valuation as `w`, then `v(a_i\phi^i)=w(a_i\phi^i)` since the
            valuation of key polynomials does not change during augmentations
            (Theorem 6.4 in [Mac1936II]_.) By the strict triangle inequality,
            `w(g)=v(g)`.
            Note that any `g` which is coprime to `G` is an equivalence-unit
            after finitely many steps of the Mac Lane algorithm. Indeed,
            otherwise the valuation of `g` would be infinite (follows from
            Theorem 5.1 in [Mac1936II]_) since the valuation of the key
            polynomials increases.
            When `f` is not coprime to `G`, consider `s=gcd(f,G)` and write
            `G=st`. Since `G` is squarefree, either `s` or `t` have finite
            valuation. With the above algorithm, this can be decided in
            finitely many steps. From this we can deduce the valuation of `s`
            (and in fact replace `G` with the factor with infinite valuation
            for all future computations.)
