How to make a new version of the Maxima SAGE spkg.

  1. Go to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4933
     and download the source tar.gz ball.  That's near the bottom
     of that page (i.e., hard to find if you don't scroll past
     all the big red adds).

  2. Extract the tarball to a directory maxima-??

  3. Put SAGE.txt, spkg-dist, and spkg-install in maxima-??

  4. Change into the maxima-?? directory and type:

       ./spkg-dist

  5. Test the resulting maxima-??.spkg.

  6. Evidently, it's necessary to also make a new clisp
     package (identical to before), but with a bigger number,
     so no matter what maxima gets built against the correct
     version of clisp (this can be an issue for directories
     that have been moved).   This has nothing to do with
     maxima-??.spkg -- it's about making a new clisp-??.spkg.

=============================================================

Here's what spkg-dist does:

* Removed the foreign language versions of the info files,
  since they add several MEGS (and they weren't in previous
  versions of Maxima).  This meant making empty directories
  and changing the Makefile.in's
