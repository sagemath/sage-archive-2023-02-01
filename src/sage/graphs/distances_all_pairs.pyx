Distances/shortest paths between all pairs of vertices

This module implements a few functions that deal with the computation of
distances or shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

**Efficiency** : Because these functions involve listing many times the
(out)-neighborhoods of (di)-graphs, it is useful in terms of efficiency to build
a temporary copy of the graph in a data structure that makes it easy to compute
quickly. These functions also work on large volume of data, typically dense
matrices of size `n^2`, and are expected to return corresponding dictionaries of
size `n^2`, where the integers corresponding to the vertices have first been
converted to the vertices' labels. Sadly, this last translating operation turns
out to be the most time-consuming, and for this reason it is also nice to have a
Cython module, and version of these functions that return C arrays, in order to
avoid these operations when they are not necessary.

**Memory cost** : The methods implemented in the current module sometimes need large
amounts of memory to return their result. Storing the distances between all
pairs of vertices in a graph on `1500` vertices as a dictionary of dictionaries
takes around 200MB, while storing the same information as a C array requires
4MB.


The module's main function
--------------------------

The C function ``all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS`` actually does all the
computations, and all the others (except for ``Floyd_Warshall``) are just
wrapping it. This function begins with copying the graph in a data structure
that makes it fast to query the out-neighbors of a vertex, then starts one
Breadth First Search per vertex of the (di)graph.

**What can this function compute ?**

    - The matrix of predecessors.

      This matrix `P` has size `n^2`, and is such that vertex `P[u,v]` is a
      predecessor of `v` on a shortest `uv`-path. Hence, this matrix efficiently
      encodes the information of a shortest `uv`-path for any `u,v\in G` :
      indeed, to go from `u` to `v` you should first find a shortest
      `uP[u,v]`-path, then jump from `P[u,v]` to `v` as it is one of its
      outneighbors. Apply recursively and find out what the whole path is !.

    - The matrix of distances.

      This matrix has size `n^2` and associates to any `uv` the distance from
      `u` to `v`.

    - The vector of eccentricities.

      This vector of size `n` encodes for each vertex `v` the distance to vertex
      which is furthest from `v` in the graph. In particular, the diameter of
      the graph is the maximum of these values.

**What does it take as input ?**

    - ``gg`` a (Di)Graph.

    - ``unsigned short * predecessors`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n^2\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. Set to ``NULL`` if you do not
      want to compute the predecessors.

    - ``unsigned short * distances`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n^2\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. The computation of the distances
      is necessary for the algorithm, so this value can **not** be set to
      ``NULL``.

    - ``int * eccentricity`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n\cdot\text{sizeof(int)}`. Set to ``NULL`` if you do not want to compute
      the eccentricity.

**Technical details**

    - The vertices are encoded as `1, ..., n` as they appear in the ordering of
      ``G.vertices()``.

    - Because this function works on matrices whose size is quadratic compared
      to the number of vertices when computing all distances or predecessors, it
      uses short variables to store the vertices' names instead of long ones to
      divide by 2 the size in memory. This means that only the
      diameter/eccentricities can be computed on a graph of more than 65536
      nodes. For information, the current version of the algorithm on a graph
      with `65536=2^{16}` nodes creates in memory `2` tables on `2^{32}` short
      elements (2bytes each), for a total of `2^{33}` bytes or `8` gigabytes. In
      order to support larger sizes, we would have to replace shorts by 32-bits
      int or 64-bits int, which would then require respectively 16GB or 32GB.

    - In the C version of these functions, infinite distances are represented
      with ``<unsigned short> -1 = 65535`` for ``unsigned short`` variables, and
      by ``INT32_MAX`` otherwise. These case happens when the input is a
      disconnected graph, or a non-strongly-connected digraph.

    - A memory error is raised when data structures allocation failed. This
      could happen with large graphs on computers with low memory space.

    .. WARNING::

        The function ``all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS`` has **no reason** to be
        called by the user, even though he would be writing his code in Cython
        and look for efficiency. This module contains wrappers for this function
        that feed it with the good parameters. As the function is inlined, using
        those wrappers actually saves time as it should avoid testing the
        parameters again and again in the main function's body.

    Tests if the graph is distance-regular

    A graph `G` is distance-regular if for any integers `j,k` the value

    for any two vertices `u,v\in V(G)` at distance `i` from each other.
    In particular `G` is regular, of degree `b_0` (see below), as one can take `u=v`.

    Equivalently a graph is distance-regular if there exist integers `b_i,c_i`
    such that for any two vertices `u,v` at distance `i` we have

    * `b_i = |\{x:d_G(x,u)=i+1,x\in V(G)\}\cap N_G(v)\}|, \ 0\leq i\leq d-1`
    * `c_i = |\{x:d_G(x,u)=i-1,x\in V(G)\}\cap N_G(v)\}|, \ 1\leq i\leq d,`

    where `d` is the diameter of the graph.  For more information on
    distance-regular graphs, see its associated :wikipedia:`wikipedia
    page <Distance-regular_graph>`.

def distances_and_predecessors_all_pairs(G):
    r"""
    Returns the matrix of distances in G and the matrix of predecessors.

    Distances : the matrix `M` returned is of length `n^2`, and the distance
    between vertices `u` and `v` is `M[u,v]`. The integer corresponding to a
    vertex is its index in the list ``G.vertices()``.

    Predecessors : the matrix `P` returned has size `n^2`, and is such that
    vertex `P[u,v]` is a predecessor of `v` on a shortest `uv`-path. Hence, this
    matrix efficiently encodes the information of a shortest `uv`-path for any
    `u,v\in G` : indeed, to go from `u` to `v` you should first find a shortest
    `uP[u,v]`-path, then jump from `P[u,v]` to `v` as it is one of its
    outneighbors.

    The integer corresponding to a vertex is its index in the list
    ``G.vertices()``.

    The Wiener index of a graph `G` can be defined in two equivalent

    - `W(G) = \frac 1 2 \sum_{u,v\in G} d(u,v)` where `d(u,v)` denotes the
      distance between vertices `u` and `v`.

    - Let `\Omega` be a set of `\frac {n(n-1)} 2` paths in `G` such that `\Omega`
      contains exactly one shortest `u-v` path for each set `\{u,v\}` of
      vertices in `G`. Besides, `\forall e\in E(G)`, let `\Omega(e)` denote the
      paths from `\Omega` containing `e`. We then have
      `W(G) = \sum_{e\in E(G)}|\Omega(e)|`.

def distances_distribution(G):
    r"""
    Returns the distances distribution of the (di)graph in a dictionary.

    This method *ignores all edge labels*, so that the distance considered is
    the topological distance.

    OUTPUT:

        A dictionary ``d`` such that the number of pairs of vertices at distance
        ``k`` (if any) is equal to `d[k] \cdot |V(G)| \cdot (|V(G)|-1)`.

    .. NOTE::

        We consider that two vertices that do not belong to the same connected
        component are at infinite distance, and we do not take the trivial pairs
        of vertices `(v, v)` at distance `0` into account. Empty (di)graphs and

def floyd_warshall(gg, paths = True, distances = False):
    r"""
    Computes the shortest path/distances between all pairs of vertices.

    For more information on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, see the `Wikipedia
    article on Floyd-Warshall
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm>`_.

    INPUT:

        - ``gg`` -- the graph on which to work.

        - ``paths`` (boolean) -- whether to return the dictionary of shortest
          paths. Set to ``True`` by default.

        - ``distances`` (boolean) -- whether to return the dictionary of
          distances. Set to ``False`` by default.

    OUTPUT:

        Depending on the input, this function return the dictionary of paths,
        the dictionary of distances, or a pair of dictionaries
        ``(distances, paths)`` where ``distance[u][v]`` denotes the distance of a
        shortest path from `u` to `v` and ``paths[u][v]`` denotes an inneighbor
        `w` of `v` such that `dist(u,v)= 1 + dist(u,w)`.

    .. WARNING::

        Because this function works on matrices whose size is quadratic compared
        to the number of vertices, it uses short variables instead of long ones
        to divide by 2 the size in memory. This means that the current
        implementation does not run on a graph of more than 65536 nodes (this
        can be easily changed if necessary, but would require much more
        memory. It may be worth writing two versions). For information, the
        current version of the algorithm on a graph with `65536=2^{16}` nodes
        creates in memory `2` tables on `2^{32}` short elements (2bytes each),
        for a total of `2^{34}` bytes or `16` gigabytes. Let us also remember
        that if the memory size is quadratic, the algorithm runs in cubic time.

    .. NOTE::

        When ``paths = False`` the algorithm saves roughly half of the memory as
        it does not have to maintain the matrix of predecessors. However,
        setting ``distances=False`` produces no such effect as the algorithm can
        not run without computing them. They will not be returned, but they will
        be stored while the method is running.
