Construct Elliptic Curves as Jacobians

An elliptic curve is a genus one curve with a designated point. The
Jacobian of a genus-one curve can be defined as the set of line
bundles on the curve, and is isomorphic to the original genus-one
curve. It is also an elliptic curve with the trivial line bundle as
designated point. The utility of this construction is that we can
construct elliptic curves without having to specify which point we
take as the origin.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: R.<u,v,w> = QQ[]
    sage: Jacobian(u^3+v^3+w^3)
    Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 27/4 over Rational Field
    sage: Jacobian(u^4+v^4+w^2)
    Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 4*x over Rational Field

    sage: C = Curve(u^3+v^3+w^3)
    sage: Jacobian(C)
    Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 27/4 over Rational Field

    sage: P2.<u,v,w> = ProjectiveSpace(2, QQ)
    sage: C = P2.subscheme(u^3+v^3+w^3)
    sage: Jacobian(C)
    Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 27/4 over Rational Field

One can also define Jacobians of varieties that are not genus-one
curves. These are not implemented in this module, but we call the
relevant functionality::

    sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
    sage: f = x**5 + 1184*x**3 + 1846*x**2 + 956*x + 560
    sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(f)
    sage: Jacobian(C)
    Jacobian of Hyperelliptic Curve over Rational Field defined
    by y^2 = x^5 + 1184*x^3 + 1846*x^2 + 956*x + 560

    * A polynomial, see :func:`Jacobian_of_equation` for details.

    - ``F`` -- a polynomial defining a plane curve of genus one. May

    - ``variables`` -- list of two or three variables or ``None``

    - ``curve`` -- the genus-one curve defined by ``polynomial`` or #
      ``None`` (default). If specified, suitable morphism from the
      jacobian elliptic curve to the curve is returned.

    OUTPUT:

    An elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form isomorphic to the
    curve ``polynomial=0``. If the optional argument ``curve`` is
    specified, a rational multicover from the Jacobian elliptic curve
    to the genus-one curve is returned.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: R.<a,b,c> = QQ[]
        sage: f = a^3+b^3+60*c^3
        sage: Jacobian(f)

        sage: Jacobian(f.subs(c=1))
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 24300 over Rational Field

    If we specify the domain curve the birational covering is returned::

        sage: h = Jacobian(f, curve=Curve(f));  h
        Scheme morphism:
          From: Projective Curve over Rational Field defined by a^3 + b^3 + 60*c^3
          To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 24300 over Rational Field
          Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (a : b : c) to
                (216000*a*b^7*c + 12960000*a*b^4*c^4 + 777600000*a*b*c^7 :

        sage: h([1,-1,0])
        (0 : 1 : 0)

    Plugging in the polynomials defining `h` allows us to verify that
    it is indeed a rational morphism to the elliptic curve::

        sage: E = h.codomain()
        sage: E.defining_polynomial()(h.defining_polynomials()).factor()
        (-10077696000000000) * c^3 * b^3 * (a^3 + b^3 + 60*c^3) * (b^6 + 60*b^3*c^3 + 3600*c^6)^3

    By specifying the variables, we can also construct an elliptic
    curve over a polynomial ring::
