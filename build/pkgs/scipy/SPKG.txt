== Description ==
SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
science, and engineering. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides
convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is
built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient
numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.
Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and
are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be
depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.
