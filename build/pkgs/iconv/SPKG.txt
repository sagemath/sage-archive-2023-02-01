== Description ==
GNU libiconv is a library that is used to enable different
languages, with different characters to be handled properly.

For more details see http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

== License ==
GPL 3 and LGPL 3. So we can link against the library ok.

== SPKG Maintainers ==
 * David Kirkby

== Dependencies ==

 * None for the purposes of Sage, but in general gettext.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

  * spkg-install removes ALL files installed by inconv - man pages,
    docs, etc etc. If iconv gets updated, check these still
    remove all traces of iconv.

    The sizes of the docs and man pages is small, so they are not
    work removing from the package, as they potentially risk
    breaking the install.

=== iconv-1.13.1 (David Kirkby, February 13th 2010) ===
 * #8191 First release of libiconv, needed for R on Solaris
   and probably for Cygwin too (see #7319)
