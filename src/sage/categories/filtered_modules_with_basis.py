Filtered Modules With Basis

A *filtered module with basis* over a ring `R` means
(for the purpose of this code) a filtered `R`-module `M`
with filtration `(F_i)_{i \in I}` (typically `I = \NN`)
endowed with a basis `(b_j)_{j \in J}` of `M` and a partition
`J = \bigsqcup_{i \in I} J_i` of the set `J` (it is allowed
that some `J_i` are empty) such that for every `n \in I`,
the subfamily `(b_j)_{j \in U_n}`, where
`U_n = \bigcup_{i \leq n} J_i`, is a basis of the
`R`-submodule `F_n`.

For every `i \in I`, the `R`-submodule of `M` spanned by
`(b_j)_{j \in J_i}` is called the `i`-*th graded component*
(aka the `i`-*th homogeneous component*) of the filtered
module with basis `M`; the elements of this submodule are
referred to as *homogeneous elements of degree* `i`.

    The category of filtered modules with a distinguished basis.

    A *filtered module with basis* over a ring `R` means
    (for the purpose of this code) a filtered `R`-module `M`
    with filtration `(F_i)_{i \in I}` (typically `I = \NN`)
    endowed with a basis `(b_j)_{j \in J}` of `M` and a partition
    `J = \bigsqcup_{i \in I} J_i` of the set `J` (it is allowed
    that some `J_i` are empty) such that for every `n \in I`,
    the subfamily `(b_j)_{j \in U_n}`, where
    `U_n = \bigcup_{i \leq n} J_i`, is a basis of the
    `R`-submodule `F_n`.

    For every `i \in I`, the `R`-submodule of `M` spanned by
    `(b_j)_{j \in J_i}` is called the `i`-*th graded component*
    (aka the `i`-*th homogeneous component*) of the filtered
    module with basis `M`; the elements of this submodule are
    referred to as *homogeneous elements of degree* `i`.
    The `R`-module `M` is the direct sum of its `i`-th graded
    components over all `i \in I`, and thus becomes a graded
    `R`-module with basis.
    Conversely, any graded `R`-module with basis canonically
    becomes a filtered `R`-module with basis (by defining
    `F_n = \bigoplus_{i \leq n} G_i` where `G_i` is the `i`-th
    graded component, and defining `J_i` as the indexing set
    of the basis of the `i`-th graded component). Hence, the
    notion of a filtered `R`-module with basis is equivalent
    to the notion of a graded `R`-module with basis.

    However, the *category* of filtered `R`-modules with basis is not
    the category of graded `R`-modules with basis. Indeed, the *morphisms*
    of filtered `R`-modules with basis are defined to be morphisms of
    `R`-modules which send each `F_n` of the domain to the corresponding
    `F_n` of the target; in contrast, the morphisms of graded `R`-modules
    with basis must preserve each homogeneous component. Also,
    the notion of a filtered algebra with basis differs from
    that of a graded algebra with basis.

    .. NOTE::

        Currently, to make use of the functionality of this class,
        an instance of ``FilteredModulesWithBasis`` should fulfill
        the contract of a :class:`CombinatorialFreeModule` (most
        likely by inheriting from it). It should also have the
        indexing set `J` encoded as its ``_indices`` attribute,
        and ``_indices.subset(size=i)`` should yield the subset
        `J_i` (as an iterable). If the latter conditions are not
        satisfied, then :meth:`basis` must be overridden.

    .. NOTE::

        One should implement a ``degree_on_basis`` method in the parent
        class in order to fully utilize the methods of this category.
        This might become a required abstract method in the future.

            isomorphism. The method :meth:`projection` projects
            elements of `A` onto `\operatorname{gr} A` according to

            .. WARNING::

                When not overridden, this method returns the default
                implementation of an associated graded module --

                ``AssociatedGradedAlgebra`` is
                :class:`~sage.algebras.associated_graded.AssociatedGradedAlgebra`.
                But some instances of :class:`FilteredModulesWithBasis`
                override this method, as the associated graded module
                often is (isomorphic) to a simpler object (for instance,
                the associated graded module of a graded module can be
                identified with the graded module itself). Generic code
                that uses associated graded modules (such as the code
                of the :meth:`induced_graded_map` method below) should
                make sure to only communicate with them via the
                :meth:`to_graded_conversion`,
                :meth:`from_graded_conversion` and
                :meth:`projection` methods (in particular,
                do not expect there to be a conversion from ``self``
                to ``self.graded_algebra()``; this currently does not
                work for Clifford algebras). Similarly, when
                overriding :meth:`graded_algebra`, make sure to
                accordingly redefine these three methods, unless their
                definitions below still apply to your case (this will
                happen whenever the basis of your :meth:`graded_algebra`
                has the same indexing set as ``self``, and the partition
                of this indexing set according to degree is the same as
                for ``self``).

                Graded Module of An example of a filtered module with basis:

                sage: pp1, pp2, pp21, pp321 = [A.to_graded_conversion()(i) for i in [p1, p2, p21, p321]]
                sage: pp2 + 4 * pp21

            **Example 2.**

            We shall now construct `\operatorname{gr} f` for a
            different map `f` out of the same ``A``; the new map
            `f` will lead into a graded algebra already, namely into
            the algebra of symmetric functions::

                sage: h = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()
                sage: def map_on_basis(lam):  # redefining map_on_basis
                ....:     return h.sum_of_monomials([Partition(mu).conjugate() for k in range(sum(lam) + 1)
                ....:                                for mu in lam.remove_horizontal_border_strip(k)])
                sage: f = A.module_morphism(on_basis=map_on_basis,
                ....:                       codomain=h)  # redefining f
                sage: f(p1)
                h[] + h[1]
                sage: f(p2)
                h[] + h[1] + h[1, 1]
                sage: f(A.zero())
                0
                sage: f(p2 - 3*p1)
                -2*h[] - 2*h[1] + h[1, 1]

            The algebra ``h`` of symmetric functions in the `h`-basis
            is already graded, so its associated graded algebra is
            implemented as itself::

                sage: grh = h.graded_algebra(); grh is h
                True
                sage: grf = A.induced_graded_map(h, f); grf
                Generic morphism:
                  From: Graded Module of An example of a filtered
                   module with basis: the free module on partitions
                   over Rational Field
                  To:   Symmetric Functions over Rational Field
                   in the homogeneous basis
                sage: grf(pp1)
                h[1]
                sage: grf(pp2)
                h[1, 1]
                sage: grf(pp321)
                h[3, 2, 1]
                sage: grf(pp2 - 3*pp1)
                -3*h[1] + h[1, 1]
                sage: grf(pp21)
                h[2, 1]
                sage: grf(grA.zero())
                0

            **Example 3.**

            After having had a graded module as the codomain, let us try to
            have one as the domain instead. Our new ``f`` will go from ``h``
            to ``A``::

            The construct `\operatorname{gr} f` also makes sense when `f`
            is a filtration-preserving map between graded modules. ::

            Return the homogeneous component of degree ``n`` of the
            element ``self``.

            Let `m` be an element of a filtered `R`-module `M` with
            basis. Then, `m` can be uniquely written in the form
            `m = \sum_{i \in I} m_i`, where each `m_i` is a
            homogeneous element of degree `i`. For `n \in I`, we
            define the homogeneous component of degree `n` of the
            element `m` to be `m_n`.
