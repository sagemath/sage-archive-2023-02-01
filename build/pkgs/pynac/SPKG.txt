Summary of changes from GiNaC:
 * GiNaC::numeric was replaced completely to rely on Python and Sage types instead of CLN.
 * Use Pari via Sage to compute numerical values for special functions.
 * Printing order is consistent between different runs.
 * Inverse trig functions print with "arc" instead of "a"
