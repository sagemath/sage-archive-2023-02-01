class DiffMap(ContinuousMap):
    r"""
    Differentiable map between two differentiable manifolds.

    This class implements differentiable maps of the type

    .. MATH::

        \Phi: M \longrightarrow  N

    where `M` and `N` are differentiable manifolds over the same topological
    field `K` (in most applications, `K = \RR` or `K = \CC`).

    Differentiable maps are the *morphisms* of the *category* of
    differentiable manifolds. The set of all differentiable maps from `M` to
    `N` is therefore the homset between `M` and `N`, which is denoted by
    `\mathrm{Hom}(M,N)`.

    The class :class:`DiffMap` is a Sage *element* class, whose *parent*
    class is
    :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold_homset.DifferentiableManifoldHomset`.
    It inherits from the class
    :class:`~sage.manifolds.continuous_map.ContinuousMap` since a
    differentiable map is obviously a continuous one.

    INPUT:

    - ``parent`` -- homset `\mathrm{Hom}(M,N)` to which the differentiable
      map belongs
    - ``coord_functions`` -- (default: ``None``) if not ``None``, must be
      a dictionary of the coordinate expressions (as lists (or tuples) of the
      coordinates of the image expressed in terms of the coordinates of
      the considered point) with the pairs of charts (chart1, chart2)
      as keys (chart1 being a chart on `M` and chart2 a chart on `N`).
      If the dimension of the map's codomain is 1, a single coordinate
      expression can be passed instead of a tuple with a single element
    - ``name`` -- (default: ``None``) name given to the differentiable map
    - ``latex_name`` -- (default: ``None``) LaTeX symbol to denote the
      differentiable map; if ``None``, the LaTeX symbol is set to ``name``
    - ``is_isomorphism`` -- (default: ``False``) determines whether the
      constructed object is a isomorphism (i.e. a diffeomorphism); if set to
      ``True``, then the manifolds `M` and `N` must have the same dimension.
    - ``is_identity`` -- (default: ``False``) determines whether the
      constructed object is the identity map; if set to ``True``,
      then `N` must be `M` and the entry ``coord_functions`` is not used.

    .. NOTE::

        If the information passed by means of the argument ``coord_functions``
        is not sufficient to fully specify the differentiable map,
        further coordinate expressions, in other charts, can be subsequently
        added by means of the method
        :meth:`~sage.manifolds.continuous_map.ContinuousMap.add_expr`

    EXAMPLES:

    The standard embedding of the sphere `S^2` into `\RR^3`::

        sage: M = Manifold(2, 'S^2') # the 2-dimensional sphere S^2
        sage: U = M.open_subset('U') # complement of the North pole
        sage: c_xy.<x,y> = U.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the North pole
        sage: V = M.open_subset('V') # complement of the South pole
        sage: c_uv.<u,v> = V.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the South pole
        sage: M.declare_union(U,V)   # S^2 is the union of U and V
        sage: xy_to_uv = c_xy.transition_map(c_uv, (x/(x^2+y^2), y/(x^2+y^2)),
        ....:                 intersection_name='W', restrictions1= x^2+y^2!=0,
        ....:                 restrictions2= u^2+v^2!=0)
        sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
        sage: N = Manifold(3, 'R^3', r'\RR^3')  # R^3
        sage: c_cart.<X,Y,Z> = N.chart()  # Cartesian coordinates on R^3
        sage: Phi = M.diff_map(N,
        ....: {(c_xy, c_cart): [2*x/(1+x^2+y^2), 2*y/(1+x^2+y^2), (x^2+y^2-1)/(1+x^2+y^2)],
        ....:  (c_uv, c_cart): [2*u/(1+u^2+v^2), 2*v/(1+u^2+v^2), (1-u^2-v^2)/(1+u^2+v^2)]},
        ....: name='Phi', latex_name=r'\Phi')
        sage: Phi
        Differentiable map Phi from the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold
         S^2 to the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold R^3
        sage: Phi.parent()
        Set of Morphisms from 2-dimensional differentiable manifold S^2 to
         3-dimensional differentiable manifold R^3 in Category of smooth
         manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
        sage: Phi.parent() is Hom(M, N)
        True
        sage: type(Phi)
        <class 'sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold_homset.DifferentiableManifoldHomset_with_category.element_class'>
        sage: Phi.display()
        Phi: S^2 → R^3
        on U: (x, y) ↦ (X, Y, Z) = (2*x/(x^2 + y^2 + 1), 2*y/(x^2 + y^2 + 1),
         (x^2 + y^2 - 1)/(x^2 + y^2 + 1))
        on V: (u, v) ↦ (X, Y, Z) = (2*u/(u^2 + v^2 + 1), 2*v/(u^2 + v^2 + 1),
         -(u^2 + v^2 - 1)/(u^2 + v^2 + 1))

    It is possible to create the map via the method
    :meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold.DifferentiableManifold.diff_map`
    only in a single pair of charts: the argument ``coord_functions`` is then
    a mere list of coordinate expressions (and not a dictionary) and the
    arguments ``chart1`` and ``chart2`` have to be provided if the charts
    differ from the default ones on the domain and/or the codomain::

        sage: Phi1 = M.diff_map(N, [2*x/(1+x^2+y^2), 2*y/(1+x^2+y^2),
        ....:                       (x^2+y^2-1)/(1+x^2+y^2)],
        ....:                   chart1=c_xy, chart2=c_cart, name='Phi',
        ....:                   latex_name=r'\Phi')

    Since ``c_xy`` and ``c_cart`` are the default charts on respectively ``M``
    and ``N``, they can be omitted, so that the above declaration is equivalent
    to::

        sage: Phi1 = M.diff_map(N, [2*x/(1+x^2+y^2), 2*y/(1+x^2+y^2),
        ....:                       (x^2+y^2-1)/(1+x^2+y^2)],
        ....:                   name='Phi', latex_name=r'\Phi')

    With such a declaration, the differentiable map is only partially defined
    on the manifold `S^2`, being known in only one chart::

        sage: Phi1.display()
        Phi: S^2 → R^3
        on U: (x, y) ↦ (X, Y, Z) = (2*x/(x^2 + y^2 + 1), 2*y/(x^2 + y^2 + 1),
         (x^2 + y^2 - 1)/(x^2 + y^2 + 1))

    The definition can be completed by means of the method
    :meth:`~sage.manifolds.continuous_map.ContinuousMap.add_expr`::

        sage: Phi1.add_expr(c_uv, c_cart, [2*u/(1+u^2+v^2), 2*v/(1+u^2+v^2),
        ....:                              (1-u^2-v^2)/(1+u^2+v^2)])
        sage: Phi1.display()
        Phi: S^2 → R^3
        on U: (x, y) ↦ (X, Y, Z) = (2*x/(x^2 + y^2 + 1), 2*y/(x^2 + y^2 + 1),
         (x^2 + y^2 - 1)/(x^2 + y^2 + 1))
        on V: (u, v) ↦ (X, Y, Z) = (2*u/(u^2 + v^2 + 1), 2*v/(u^2 + v^2 + 1),
         -(u^2 + v^2 - 1)/(u^2 + v^2 + 1))

    At this stage, ``Phi1`` and ``Phi`` are fully equivalent::

        sage: Phi1 == Phi
        True

    The test suite is passed::

        sage: TestSuite(Phi).run()
        sage: TestSuite(Phi1).run()

    The map acts on points::

        sage: np = M.point((0,0), chart=c_uv, name='N')  # the North pole
        sage: Phi(np)
        Point Phi(N) on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold R^3
        sage: Phi(np).coord() # Cartesian coordinates
        (0, 0, 1)
        sage: sp = M.point((0,0), chart=c_xy, name='S')  # the South pole
        sage: Phi(sp).coord() # Cartesian coordinates
        (0, 0, -1)

    The differential `\mathrm{d}\Phi` of the map `\Phi` at the North pole and
    at the South pole::

        sage: Phi.differential(np)
        Generic morphism:
          From: Tangent space at Point N on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold S^2
          To:   Tangent space at Point Phi(N) on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold R^3
        sage: Phi.differential(sp)
        Generic morphism:
          From: Tangent space at Point S on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold S^2
          To:   Tangent space at Point Phi(S) on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold R^3

    The matrix of the linear map `\mathrm{d}\Phi_N` with respect to the default
    bases of `T_N S^2` and `T_{\Phi(N)} \RR^3`::

        sage: Phi.differential(np).matrix()
        [2 0]
        [0 2]
        [0 0]

    the default bases being::

        sage: Phi.differential(np).domain().default_basis()
        Basis (∂/∂u,∂/∂v) on the Tangent space at Point N on the 2-dimensional
         differentiable manifold S^2
        sage: Phi.differential(np).codomain().default_basis()
        Basis (∂/∂X,∂/∂Y,∂/∂Z) on the Tangent space at Point Phi(N) on the
         3-dimensional differentiable manifold R^3

    Differentiable maps can be composed by means of the operator ``*``: let
    us introduce the map `\RR^3\rightarrow \RR^2` corresponding to
    the projection from the point `(X,Y,Z)=(0,0,1)` onto the equatorial plane
    `Z=0`::

        sage: P = Manifold(2, 'R^2', r'\RR^2') # R^2 (equatorial plane)
        sage: cP.<xP, yP> = P.chart()
        sage: Psi = N.diff_map(P, (X/(1-Z), Y/(1-Z)), name='Psi',
        ....:                  latex_name=r'\Psi')
        sage: Psi
        Differentiable map Psi from the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold
         R^3 to the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2
        sage: Psi.display()
        Psi: R^3 → R^2
           (X, Y, Z) ↦ (xP, yP) = (-X/(Z - 1), -Y/(Z - 1))

    Then we compose ``Psi`` with ``Phi``, thereby getting a map
    `S^2\rightarrow \RR^2`::

        sage: ster = Psi*Phi ; ster
        Differentiable map from the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold S^2
         to the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2

    Let us test on the South pole (``sp``) that ``ster`` is indeed the
    composite of ``Psi`` and ``Phi``::

        sage: ster(sp) == Psi(Phi(sp))
        True

    Actually ``ster`` is the stereographic projection from the North pole, as
    its coordinate expression reveals::

        sage: ster.display()
        S^2 → R^2
        on U: (x, y) ↦ (xP, yP) = (x, y)
        on V: (u, v) ↦ (xP, yP) = (u/(u^2 + v^2), v/(u^2 + v^2))

    If its codomain is 1-dimensional, a differentiable map must be
    defined by a single symbolic expression for each pair of charts, and not
    by a list/tuple with a single element::

        sage: N = Manifold(1, 'N')
        sage: c_N = N.chart('X')
        sage: Phi = M.diff_map(N, {(c_xy, c_N): x^2+y^2,
        ....: (c_uv, c_N): 1/(u^2+v^2)})  # not ...[1/(u^2+v^2)] or (1/(u^2+v^2),)

    An example of differentiable map `\RR \rightarrow \RR^2`::

        sage: R = Manifold(1, 'R')  # field R
        sage: T.<t> = R.chart()  # canonical chart on R
        sage: R2 = Manifold(2, 'R^2')  # R^2
        sage: c_xy.<x,y> = R2.chart() # Cartesian coordinates on R^2
        sage: Phi = R.diff_map(R2, [cos(t), sin(t)], name='Phi') ; Phi
        Differentiable map Phi from the 1-dimensional differentiable manifold R
         to the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2
        sage: Phi.parent()
        Set of Morphisms from 1-dimensional differentiable manifold R to
         2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2 in Category of smooth
         manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
        sage: Phi.parent() is Hom(R, R2)
        True
        sage: Phi.display()
        Phi: R → R^2
           t ↦ (x, y) = (cos(t), sin(t))

    An example of diffeomorphism between the unit open disk and the Euclidean
    plane `\RR^2`::

        sage: D = R2.open_subset('D', coord_def={c_xy: x^2+y^2<1}) # the open unit disk
        sage: Phi = D.diffeomorphism(R2, [x/sqrt(1-x^2-y^2), y/sqrt(1-x^2-y^2)],
        ....:                        name='Phi', latex_name=r'\Phi')
        sage: Phi
        Diffeomorphism Phi from the Open subset D of the 2-dimensional
         differentiable manifold R^2 to the 2-dimensional differentiable
         manifold R^2
        sage: Phi.parent()
        Set of Morphisms from Open subset D of the 2-dimensional differentiable
         manifold R^2 to 2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2 in Category
         of smooth manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
        sage: Phi.parent() is Hom(D, R2)
        True
        sage: Phi.display()
        Phi: D → R^2
           (x, y) ↦ (x, y) = (x/sqrt(-x^2 - y^2 + 1), y/sqrt(-x^2 - y^2 + 1))

    The image of a point::

        sage: p = D.point((1/2,0))
        sage: q = Phi(p) ; q
        Point on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2
        sage: q.coord()
        (1/3*sqrt(3), 0)

    The inverse diffeomorphism is computed by means of the method
    :meth:`~sage.manifolds.continuous_map.ContinuousMap.inverse`::

        sage: Phi.inverse()
        Diffeomorphism Phi^(-1) from the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2
         to the Open subset D of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2
        sage: Phi.inverse().display()
        Phi^(-1): R^2 → D
           (x, y) ↦ (x, y) = (x/sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 1), y/sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 1))

    Equivalently, one may use the notations ``^(-1)`` or ``~`` to get the
    inverse::

        sage: Phi^(-1) is Phi.inverse()
        True
        sage: ~Phi is Phi.inverse()
        True

    Check that ``~Phi`` is indeed the inverse of ``Phi``::

        sage: (~Phi)(q) == p
        True
        sage: Phi * ~Phi == R2.identity_map()
        True
        sage: ~Phi * Phi == D.identity_map()
        True

    The coordinate expression of the inverse diffeomorphism::

        sage: (~Phi).display()
        Phi^(-1): R^2 → D
           (x, y) ↦ (x, y) = (x/sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 1), y/sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 1))

    A special case of diffeomorphism: the identity map of the open unit disk::

        sage: id = D.identity_map() ; id
        Identity map Id_D of the Open subset D of the 2-dimensional
         differentiable manifold R^2
        sage: latex(id)
        \mathrm{Id}_{D}
        sage: id.parent()
        Set of Morphisms from Open subset D of the 2-dimensional differentiable
         manifold R^2 to Open subset D of the 2-dimensional differentiable
         manifold R^2 in Join of Category of subobjects of sets and Category of
         smooth manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
        sage: id.parent() is Hom(D, D)
        True
        sage: id is Hom(D,D).one()  # the identity element of the monoid Hom(D,D)
        True

    The identity map acting on a point::

        sage: id(p)
        Point on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold R^2
        sage: id(p) == p
        True
        sage: id(p) is p
        True

    The coordinate expression of the identity map::

        sage: id.display()
        Id_D: D → D
           (x, y) ↦ (x, y)

    The identity map is its own inverse::

        True
        sage: ~id is id
        True
