If you're reading this, then someone tried to build the SageTeX
documentation by setting \$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS, but there was some
error.

If you just want the documentation, you can get \`example.pdf' and
\`sagetex.pdf' from http://bitbucket.org/ddrake/sagetex/downloads .

If you want to figure out what went wrong, try reinstalling the SageTeX
spkg and request that the documentation be built:

    env SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes sage -i sagetex

and see what goes wrong. Feel free to contact sage-support for further
help:
