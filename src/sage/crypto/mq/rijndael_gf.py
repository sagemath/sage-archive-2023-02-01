Rijndael-GF

Rijndael-GF is an algebraic implementation of the AES cipher which seeks to
provide a fully generalized algebraic representation of both the whole AES
cipher as well as its individual components.

This class is an algebraic implementation of the Rijndael-GF extension of the
AES cipher, as described in [DR02]_. The AES cipher itself is defined to
operate on a state in `(\GF{2})^{8 n_t}` where
`n_t \in \{16, 20, 24, 28, 32\}`. Rijndael-GF is a generalization of AES which
allows for operations in `(\GF{2^8})^{n_t}`, enabling more algebraically
sophisticated study of AES and its variants. This implementation of
Rijndael-GF is suitable for learning purposes, for comparison to other
algebraic ciphers, and for studying various techniques of algebraic
cryptanalysis of AES. This cipher is different from
:mod:`Mini-AES <sage.crypto.block_cipher.miniaes>`, which is a
teaching tool for beginners to understand the basic structure of AES.

An algebraic implementation of Rijndael-GF is achieved by recognizing that
for each round component function `\phi` of AES (SubBytes, ShiftRows, etc.)
operating on state matrices, every entry of the output matrix `B = \phi(A)` is
representable as a polynomial with variables being the entries of the input
state matrix `A`. Correspondingly, this implementation of Rijndael-GF provides
a ``RijndaelGF.Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` class which allows for creation
of these such polynomials. For each round component function `\phi` of
Rijndael-GF there exists a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object with a
``__call__`` method of the form ``__call__(i, j)`` which returns a polynomial
representing `\phi(A)_{i,j}` in terms of the entries of `A`.
There additionally are various methods provided which allow for easy polynomial
evaluation and for simple creation of ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` objects
representing more complex aspects of the cipher.

This approach to implementing Rijndael-GF bears some similarity to the
multivariate quadratic (MQ) systems utilized in :mod:`SR <sage.crypto.mq.sr>`,
in that the MQ systems also seek to describe the AES cipher as a system of
algebraic equations. Despite this initial similarity though, Rijndael-GF and
:mod:`SR <sage.crypto.mq.sr>` are quite different as this implementation
seeks to provide a fully generalized algebraic representation of both the
whole AES cipher as well as its individual components, while
:mod:`SR <sage.crypto.mq.sr>` is instead a family of parameterizable variants
of the AES suitable as a framework for comparing different cryptanalytic
techniques that can be brought to bear on the AES.

EXAMPLES

We build Rijndael-GF with a block length of 4 and a key length of 6: ::

    sage: from sage.crypto.mq.rijndael_gf import RijndaelGF
    sage: rgf = RijndaelGF(4, 6)

We can encrypt plaintexts and decrypt and ciphertexts by calling the
``encrypt`` and ``decrypt`` methods or by calling the Rijndael-GF object
explicitly. Note that the default input format is a hex string. ::

    sage: plaintext = '00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff'
    sage: key = '000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f1011121314151617'
    sage: rgf.encrypt(plaintext, key)
    'dda97ca4864cdfe06eaf70a0ec0d7191'
    sage: rgf.decrypt('dda97ca4864cdfe06eaf70a0ec0d7191', key)
    '00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff'

We can also use binary strings as input and output. ::

    sage: plain = '11101011100111110000000111001100' * 4
    sage: key = '01100010111101101000110010111010' * 6
    sage: ciphertext = rgf(plain, key, format='binary')
    sage: ciphertext
    '11010011000010011010110001000011101110110100110100110010011011111100011011100111110011100111010011001110110100011100000011111011'
    sage: rgf(ciphertext, key, algorithm='decrypt', format='binary') == plain
    True

[DR02]_ demonstrates an example of encryption which takes the plaintext
'3243f6a8885a308d313198a2e0370734' and the key
'2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c' and returns the ciphertext
'3902dc1925dc116a8409850b1dfb9732'. We can use this example to demonstrate
the correctness of this implementation: ::

    sage: rgf = RijndaelGF(4, 4) # change dimensions for this example
    sage: plain = '3243f6a8885a308d313198a2e0370734'
    sage: key = '2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c'
    sage: expected_ciphertext = '3925841d02dc09fbdc118597196a0b32'
    sage: rgf.encrypt(plain, key) == expected_ciphertext
    True

::

    sage: rgf = RijndaelGF(4, 6) # revert to previous dimensions

To build polynomials representing entries of the output matrix `B = \phi(A)`
for any round component function `\phi`, each of the round component functions
(SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns) have a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr``
object associated with it for building polynomials. These objects can be
accessed by calling their getter functions: ``rgf.sub_bytes_poly()``,
``rgf.shift_rows_poly()``, and ``rgf.mix_columns_poly()``. Each returned
object has a ``__call__`` method which takes an index ``i,j`` and an
``algorithm`` flag ('encrypt' or 'decrypt') and returns a polynomial
representing `\phi(A)_{i,j}` in terms of the entries of `A`, where `A` is an
arbitrary state matrix and `\phi` is the round component function associated
with that particular ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object. Some of these
objects' ``__call__`` methods also have additional keywords to modify their
behavior, and so we describe the usage of each object below.

``rgf.shift_rows_poly()`` and ``rgf.mix_columns_poly()`` do not have any
additional keywords for their ``__call__`` methods and we can call them as
such: ::

    sage: sr_pc = rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr()
    sage: sr_pc(1, 2)
    a13
    sage: sr_pc(2, 3, algorithm='decrypt')
    a21

::

    sage: mc_pc = rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr()
    sage: mc_pc(1, 2)
    a02 + (x)*a12 + (x + 1)*a22 + a32
    sage: mc_pc(2, 3, algorithm='decrypt')
    (x^3 + x^2 + 1)*a03 + (x^3 + 1)*a13 + (x^3 + x^2 + x)*a23 + (x^3 + x + 1)*a33

``rgf.sub_bytes_poly()`` has a single keyword ``no_inversion=False``, which
when set to ``True`` returns only the affine transformation step of SubBytes.
Below describes the usage of ``rgf.sub_bytes_poly()`` ::

    sage: sb_pc = rgf.sub_bytes_poly_constr()
    sage: sb_pc(1, 2)
    (x^2 + 1)*a12^254 +
    (x^3 + 1)*a12^253 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1)*a12^251 +
    (x^5 + x^2 + 1)*a12^247 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2)*a12^239 +
    a12^223 +
    (x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + 1)*a12^191 +
    (x^7 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*a12^127 +
    (x^6 + x^5 + x + 1)
    sage: sb_pc(2, 3, no_inversion=True)
    (x^7 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*a23^128 +
    (x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + 1)*a23^64 +
    a23^32 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2)*a23^16 +
    (x^5 + x^2 + 1)*a23^8 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1)*a23^4 +
    (x^3 + 1)*a23^2 +
    (x^2 + 1)*a23 +
    (x^6 + x^5 + x + 1)

Because of the order of the affine transformation and the inversion step in
SubBytes, calling ``rgf.sub_bytes_poly()(i, j, algorithm='decrypt')`` results
in a polynomial with thousands of terms which takes a very long time to
compute. Hence, when using the decryption version of ``rgf.sub_bytes_poly()``
with the intention of evaluating the polynomials it constructs, it is
recommended to first call ``rgf.sub_bytes_poly()(i, j, algorithm='decrypt',
no_inversion=True)`` to get a polynomial representing only the inverse affine
transformation, evaluate this polynomial for a particular input block, then
finally perform the inversion step after the affine transformation polynomial
has been evaluated. ::

    sage: inv_affine = sb_pc(1, 2, algorithm='decrypt',
    ....: no_inversion=True)
    sage: state = rgf._hex_to_GF('ff87968431d86a51645151fa773ad009')
    sage: evaluated = inv_affine(state.list())
    sage: result = evaluated * -1
    sage: rgf._GF_to_hex(result)
    '79'

We can see how the variables of these polynomials are organized in `A`: ::

    sage: rgf.state_vrs
    [a00 a01 a02 a03]
    [a10 a11 a12 a13]
    [a20 a21 a22 a23]
    [a30 a31 a32 a33]

The final ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object we have not discussed yet is
``add_round_key_poly``, which corresponds to the AddRoundKey round component
function. This object differs from the other ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr``
objects in that it returns polynomials with variables being entries of an
input state `A` as well as entries of various subkeys. Since there are `N_r`
subkeys to choose from, ``add_round_key_poly`` has a keyword of ``round=0`` to
select which subkey to use variables from. ::

    sage: ark_pc = rgf.add_round_key_poly_constr()
    sage: ark_pc(1, 2)
    a12 + k012
    sage: ark_pc(1, 2, algorithm='decrypt')
    a12 + k012
    sage: ark_pc(2, 3, round=7)
    a23 + k723

We can see how key variables are organized in the original key (the key used
to build the rest of the subkeys) below. Note that because key variables are
subkey entries, if the key length is longer than the block length we will have
entries from multiple subkeys in the original key matrix. ::

    sage: rgf.key_vrs
    [k000 k001 k002 k003 k100 k101]
    [k010 k011 k012 k013 k110 k111]
    [k020 k021 k022 k023 k120 k121]
    [k030 k031 k032 k033 k130 k131]

We can evaluate any of these constructed polynomials for a particular input
state (in essence, calculate `\phi(A)_{i,j}`) as such: ::

    sage: rgf = RijndaelGF(4, 6)
    sage: state = rgf._hex_to_GF('fe7b5170fe7c8e93477f7e4bf6b98071')
    sage: poly = mc_pc(3, 2, algorithm='decrypt')
    sage: poly(state.list())
    x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^2 + x

We can use the ``apply_poly`` method to build a matrix whose `i,j` th
entry equals the polynomial ``phi_poly(i, j)`` evaluated for a particular input
state, where ``phi_poly`` is the ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object
associated with the round component function `\phi`. Essentially,
``apply_poly`` calculates `\phi(A)`, where `A` is our input state.
Calling ``apply_poly`` is equivalent to applying the round component function
associated this ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object to `A`. ::

    sage: state = rgf._hex_to_GF('c4cedcabe694694e4b23bfdd6fb522fa')
    sage: result = rgf.apply_poly(state, rgf.sub_bytes_poly_constr())
    sage: rgf._GF_to_hex(result)
    '1c8b86628e22f92fb32608c1a8d5932d'
    sage: result == rgf.sub_bytes(state)
    True

Alternatively, we can pass a matrix of polynomials as input to ``apply_poly``,
which will then return another matrix of polynomials. For example,
``rgf.state_vrs`` can be used as input to make each ``i,j`` th entry of the
output matrix equal ``phi_poly_constr(i, j)``, where ``phi_poly_constr`` is
our inputted ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object. This matrix can then be
passed through again and so on, demonstrating how one could potentially build
a matrix of polynomials representing the entire cipher. ::

    sage: state = rgf.apply_poly(rgf.state_vrs, rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr())
    sage: state
    [a00 a01 a02 a03]
    [a11 a12 a13 a10]
    [a22 a23 a20 a21]
    [a33 a30 a31 a32]
    sage: rgf.apply_poly(state, rgf.add_round_key_poly_constr())
    [a00 + k000 a01 + k001 a02 + k002 a03 + k003]
    [a11 + k010 a12 + k011 a13 + k012 a10 + k013]
    [a22 + k020 a23 + k021 a20 + k022 a21 + k023]
    [a33 + k030 a30 + k031 a31 + k032 a32 + k033]

For any of these ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` objects, we can change the
keywords of its ``__call__`` method when ``apply_poly`` invokes it by passing
``apply_poly`` a dictionary mapping keywords to their values. ::

    sage: rgf.apply_poly(rgf.state_vrs, rgf.add_round_key_poly_constr(),
    ....: poly_constr_attr={'round' : 5})
    [a00 + k500 a01 + k501 a02 + k502 a03 + k503]
    [a10 + k510 a11 + k511 a12 + k512 a13 + k513]
    [a20 + k520 a21 + k521 a22 + k522 a23 + k523]
    [a30 + k530 a31 + k531 a32 + k532 a33 + k533]

We can build our own ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` objects which correspond
to the composition of multiple round component functions with the ``compose``
method. To do this, if we pass two ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` objects
to ``compose`` where the first object corresponds to the round component
function `f` and the second to the round component function `g`, ``compose``
will return a new ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object corresponding to the
function `g \circ f`. This returned ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object
will have the arguments of ``__call__(row, col, algorithm='encrypt')`` and
when passed an index ``i,j`` will return `g(f(A))_{i,j}` in terms of the
entries of `A`. ::

    sage: rcpc = rgf.compose(rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr(),
    ....: rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr())
    sage: rcpc
    A polynomial constructor of a round component of Rijndael-GF block cipher with block length 4, key length 6, and 12 rounds.
    sage: rcpc(2, 1)
    a01 + a12 + (x)*a23 + (x + 1)*a30
    <BLANKLINE>
    sage: state = rgf._hex_to_GF('afb73eeb1cd1b85162280f27fb20d585')
    sage: result = rgf.apply_poly(state, rcpc)
    sage: new_state = rgf.shift_rows(state)
    sage: new_state = rgf.mix_columns(new_state)
    sage: result == new_state
    True
    <BLANKLINE>
    sage: rcpc = rgf.compose(rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr(),
    ....: rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr())
    sage: result = rgf.apply_poly(state, rcpc, algorithm='decrypt')
    sage: new_state = rgf.mix_columns(state, algorithm='decrypt')
    sage: new_state = rgf.shift_rows(new_state, algorithm='decrypt')
    sage: new_state == result
    True

Alternatively, we can use ``compose`` to build the polynomial output of
a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object corresponding to the composition of
multiple round functions like above without having to explicitly build our
own ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object. To do this, we simply make the
first input a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object corresponding to a
round component function `f` and make the second input a polynomial
representing `g(A)_{i,j}` for a round component function `g`. Given this,
``compose`` will return a polynomial representing `g(f(A))_{i,j}` in terms
of the entries of `A`. ::

    sage: poly = rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr()(0, 3)
    sage: poly
    (x)*a03 + (x + 1)*a13 + a23 + a33
    sage: rgf.compose(rgf.sub_bytes_poly_constr(), poly)
    (x^3 + x)*a03^254 +
    (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*a13^254 +
    (x^2 + 1)*a23^254 +
    (x^2 + 1)*a33^254 +
    (x^4 + x)*a03^253 +
    (x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)*a13^253 +
    (x^3 + 1)*a23^253 +
    (x^3 + 1)*a33^253 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^3 + 1)*a03^251 +
    (x^4)*a13^251 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1)*a23^251 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1)*a33^251 +
    (x^6 + x^3 + x)*a03^247 +
    (x^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*a13^247 +
    (x^5 + x^2 + 1)*a23^247 +
    (x^5 + x^2 + 1)*a33^247 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x + 1)*a03^239 +
    (x^2 + x + 1)*a13^239 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2)*a23^239 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2)*a33^239 +
    (x)*a03^223 +
    (x + 1)*a13^223 +
    a23^223 +
    a33^223 +
    (x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + 1)*a03^191 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^2)*a13^191 +
    (x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + 1)*a23^191 +
    (x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + 1)*a33^191 +
    (x^2 + 1)*a03^127 +
    (x^7 + x^3 + x)*a13^127 +
    (x^7 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*a23^127 +
    (x^7 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*a33^127 +
    (x^6 + x^5 + x + 1)

If we use ``algorithm='decrypt'`` as an argument to ``compose``, then the
value of ``algorithm`` will be passed directly to the first argument of
``compose`` (a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object) when it is called,
provided the second argument is a polynomial. Setting this flag does nothing
if both arguments are ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` objects, since the
returned ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object's ``__call__`` method must have
its own ``algorithm`` keyword defaulted to 'encrypt'. ::

    sage: poly = rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr()(2, 1)
    sage: rgf.compose(rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr(), poly, algorithm='decrypt')
    (x^3 + x^2 + 1)*a03 + (x^3 + 1)*a13 + (x^3 + x^2 + x)*a23 + (x^3 + x + 1)*a33
    <BLANKLINE>
    sage: state = rgf._hex_to_GF('80121e0776fd1d8a8d8c31bc965d1fee')
    sage: with_decrypt = rgf.compose(rgf.sub_bytes_poly_constr(),
    ....: rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr(), algorithm='decrypt')
    sage: result_wd = rgf.apply_poly(state, with_decrypt)
    sage: no_decrypt = rgf.compose(rgf.sub_bytes_poly_constr(),
    ....: rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr())
    sage: result_nd = rgf.apply_poly(state, no_decrypt)
    sage: result_wd == result_nd
    True

We can also pass keyword dictionaries of ``f_attr`` and ``g_attr`` to
``compose`` to make ``f`` and ``g`` use those keywords during polynomial
creation. ::

    sage: rcpc = rgf.compose(rgf.add_round_key_poly_constr(),
    ....: rgf.add_round_key_poly_constr(),
    ....: f_attr={'round' : 4}, g_attr={'round' : 7})
    sage: rcpc(1, 2)
    a12 + k412 + k712

In addition to building polynomial representations of state matrices, we can
also build polynomial representations of elements of the expanded key with the
``expand_key_poly`` method. However, since the key schedule is defined
recursively, it is impossible to build polynomials for the key schedule in
the same manner as we do for the round component functions. Consequently,
``expand_round_key_poly()`` is not a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object.
Instead, ``expand_key_poly`` is a method which takes an index ``i,j`` and a
round number ``round``, and returns a polynomial representing the `i,j` th
entry of the ``round`` th round key. This polynomial's variables are entries
of the original key we built above. ::

    sage: rgf.expand_key_poly(1, 2, 0)
    k012
    sage: rgf.expand_key_poly(1, 1, 1)
    k111
    sage: rgf.expand_key_poly(1, 2, 1)
    (x^2 + 1)*k121^254 +
    (x^3 + 1)*k121^253 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1)*k121^251 +
    (x^5 + x^2 + 1)*k121^247 +
    (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2)*k121^239 +
    k121^223 +
    (x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + 1)*k121^191 +
    (x^7 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*k121^127 +
    k010 +
    (x^6 + x^5 + x)

Since ``expand_key_poly`` is not actually a
``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object, we cannot use it as input to
``apply_poly`` or ``compose``. ::

        An algebraically generalized version of the AES cipher.

        INPUT:

        - ``Nb`` -- The block length of this instantiation. Must be between 4
          and 8.

        - ``Nk`` -- The key length of this instantion. Must be between 4 and 8.

          elements from state matrices.

        - ``key_chr`` -- The variable name for polynomials representing
          elements of the key schedule.

        EXAMPLES::

            Rijndael-GF block cipher with block length 6, key length 8, and 14 rounds.

        By changing ``state_chr`` we can alter the names of variables in
        polynomials representing elements from state matrices. ::

            sage: rgf = RijndaelGF(4, 6, state_chr='myChr')

        We can also alter the name of variables in polynomials representing
        elements from round keys by changing ``key_chr``. ::

        - ``g`` -- A ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object corresponding to
          a round component function `g` or a polynomial output of this
          object's ``__call__`` method.

        - ``algorithm`` -- (default: "encrypt") Whether ``f`` and ``g``
          should use their encryption transformations or their decryption
          transformations. Does nothing if ``g`` is a
          ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object. The encryption flag is
          "encrypt" and the decryption flag is "decrypt".

        - ``f_attr`` -- (default: None) A dictionary of keyword attributes to
          pass to ``f`` when it is called.

        - ``g_attr`` -- (default: None) A dictionary of keyword attributes to
          pass to ``g`` when it is called. Does nothing if ``g`` is a
          polynomial.

        OUTPUT:

        - If ``g`` is a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object corresponding
          to a round component function `g`, then ``compose`` returns a
          ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` corresponding to the round
          component function `g \circ f`, where `f` is the round component
          function corresponding to the first argument ``f``. On the other
          hand, if ``g`` `= g(A)_{i,j}` for a round component function `g`,
          then ``compose`` returns `g(f(A))_{i,j}`, where `A` is an
          arbitrary input state matrix.

        EXAMPLES

        This function allows us to determine the polynomial representations
        of entries across multiple round functions. For example, if we
        wanted a polynomial representing the ``1,3`` entry of a matrix after
        we first apply ShiftRows and then MixColumns to that matrix, we do: ::

            sage: from sage.crypto.mq.rijndael_gf import RijndaelGF
            sage: rgf = RijndaelGF(4, 4)
            sage: mcp = rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr()(1, 3); mcp
            a03 + (x)*a13 + (x + 1)*a23 + a33
            sage: result = rgf.compose(rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr(), mcp)
            sage: result
            a03 + (x)*a10 + (x + 1)*a21 + a32

        We can test the correctness of this: ::

            sage: state = rgf._hex_to_GF('fa636a2825b339c940668a3157244d17')
            sage: new_state = rgf.shift_rows(state)
            sage: new_state = rgf.mix_columns(new_state)
            sage: result(state.list()) == new_state[1,3]
            True

        We can also use ``compose`` to build a new
        ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object corresponding to the composition
        of multiple round functions as such: ::

            sage: fn = rgf.compose(rgf.shift_rows_poly_constr(),
            ....: rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr())
            sage: fn(1, 3)
            a03 + (x)*a10 + (x + 1)*a21 + a32

        If we use ``compose`` to make a new ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr``
        object, we can use that object as input to ``apply_poly`` and
        ``compose``: ::

            sage: state = rgf._hex_to_GF('36400926f9336d2d9fb59d23c42c3950')
            sage: result = rgf.apply_poly(state, fn)
            sage: rgf._GF_to_hex(result)
            'f4bcd45432e554d075f1d6c51dd03b3c'
            <BLANKLINE>
            sage: new_state = rgf.shift_rows(state)
            sage: new_state = rgf.mix_columns(new_state)
            sage: result == new_state
            True

        ::

            sage: fn2 = rgf.compose(rgf.sub_bytes_poly_constr(), fn)

        If the second argument is a polynomial, then the value of ``algorithm``
        is passed directly to the first argument `f` during evaluation.
        However, if the second argument is a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr``
        object, changing ``algorithm`` does nothing since the returned object
        has its own ``algorithm='encrypt'`` keyword. ::

            sage: f = rgf.compose(rgf.sub_bytes_poly_constr(),
            ....: rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr(), algorithm='decrypt')
            sage: g = rgf.compose(rgf.sub_bytes_poly_constr(),
            ....: rgf.mix_columns_poly_constr())
            sage: all([f(i,j) == g(i,j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4)])
            True

        We can change the keyword attributes of the ``__call__`` methods of
        ``f`` and ``g`` by passing dictionaries ``f_attr`` and ``g_attr`` to
        ``compose``. ::

            sage: fn = rgf.compose(rgf.add_round_key_poly_constr(),

        The returned object's ``__call__`` method has an additional keyword

        We can build a polynomial representing the inverse transformation
        by setting the keyword ``algorithm='decrypt'``. However, the order of
        the affine transformation and the inversion step in SubBytes means that
        this polynomial has thousands of terms and is very slow to compute.
        Hence, if one wishes to build the decryption polynomial with the
        intention of evaluating that polynomial for a particular input, it is
        strongly recommended to first call
        ``sb_pc(i, j, algorithm='decrypt', no_inversion=True)`` to build a
        polynomial representing only the inverse affine transformation,
        evaluate this polynomial for your intended input, then finally
        calculate the inverse of the result. ::

        When passing the returned object to ``apply_poly`` and ``compose``, we
        can make those methods change the keyword ``no_inversion`` of this
        object's ``__call__`` method by passing the dictionary
        ``{'no_inversion' : True}`` to them. ::

            sage: rgf._sub_bytes_pc(0, 2, no_inversion=True)
            (x^7 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*a02^128 + (x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + 1)*a02^64 + a02^32 + (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2)*a02^16 + (x^5 + x^2 + 1)*a02^8 + (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1)*a02^4 + (x^3 + 1)*a02^2 + (x^2 + 1)*a02 + (x^6 + x^5 + x + 1)

        When generating a decryption polynomial, calculating the inverse of
        the polynomial representing the affine transformation can be a very
        slow process. In order to speed up decryption when applying
        ``sub_bytes_poly`` to a state matrix, it is recommended to calculate
        the decryption polynomial with ``no_inversion=True``, evaluate the
        arguments, then perform the inversion after this result has been
        calculated. ::

                A polynomial constructor for the function 'Shift Rows' of Rijndael-GF block cipher with block length 4, key length 4, and 10 rounds.

            If `\phi` is the round component function to which this object
            corresponds to, then ``__call__(i,j)`` `= \phi(A)_{i,j}`, where
            `A` is an arbitrary input matrix. Note that the polynomial returned
            by ``__call__(i,j)`` will be in terms of the entries of `A`. ::

            Invoking this objects ``__call__`` method passes its arguments
            directly to ``polynomial_constr`` and returns the result. In a
            sense, ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` acts as a wrapper for
            the ``polynomial_constr`` method and helps ensure that each
            ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object will act similarly. ::

                ....: for i in range(4) for j in range(4)])
                True

            Since all keyword arguments of ``polynomial_constr`` must have a
            default value except for ``row`` and ``col``, we can always call
            a ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object by ``__call__(row, col)``.
            Because of this, methods such as ``apply_poly`` and ``compose``
            will only call ``__call__(row, col)`` when passed a
            ``Round_Component_Poly_Constr`` object. In order to change this
            object's behavior and force methods such as ``apply_poly`` to use
            non-default values for keywords we can pass dictionaries mapping
            keywords to non-default values as input to ``apply_poly`` and
            ``compose``. ::
