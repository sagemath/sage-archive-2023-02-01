Fast calculation of cyclotomic polynomials

This module provides a function :func:`cyclotomic_coeffs`, which calculates the
coefficients of cyclotomic polynomials. This is not intended to be invoked
directly by the user, but it is called by the method
:meth:`~sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_general.cyclotomic_polynomial`
method of univariate polynomial ring objects and the top-level
:func:`~sage.misc.functional.cyclotomic_polynomial` function.

def cyclotomic_coeffs(nn, sparse=None):

    This calculates the coefficients of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial
    by using the formula

    .. math::

        \\Phi_n(x) = \\prod_{d|n} (1-x^{n/d})^{\\mu(d)}

    where `\\mu(d)` is the Möbius function that is 1 if d has an even
    number of distinct prime divisors, -1 if it has an odd number of
    distinct prime divisors, and 0 if d is not squarefree.

    Multiplications and divisions by polynomials of the
    form `1-x^n` can be done very quickly in a single pass.

    If sparse is True, the result is returned as a dictionary of the non-zero
    entries, otherwise the result is returned as a list of python ints.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.cyclotomic import cyclotomic_coeffs
        sage: cyclotomic_coeffs(30)
        [1, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1]
        sage: cyclotomic_coeffs(10^5)
        {0: 1, 10000: -1, 20000: 1, 30000: -1, 40000: 1}
        sage: R = QQ['x']
        sage: R(cyclotomic_coeffs(30))
        x^8 + x^7 - x^5 - x^4 - x^3 + x + 1

    Check that it has the right degree::

        sage: euler_phi(30)
        8
        sage: R(cyclotomic_coeffs(14)).factor()
        x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1

    The coefficients are not always +/-1::

        sage: cyclotomic_coeffs(105)
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, -2, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, -2, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

    In fact the height is not bounded by any polynomial in n (Erdos),
    although takes a while just to exceed linear::

        sage: v = cyclotomic_coeffs(1181895)
        sage: max(v)
        14102773

    The polynomial is a palindrome for any n::

        sage: n = ZZ.random_element(50000)
        sage: factor(n)
        3 * 10009
        sage: v = cyclotomic_coeffs(n, sparse=False)
        sage: v == list(reversed(v))
        True

def cyclotomic_value(n, x):

    Returns the value of the `n`-th cyclotomic polynomial evaulated at `x`.

    INPUT:

    - n -- an Integer, specifying which cyclotomic polynomial is to be
      evaluated.
    - x -- an element of a ring.

    OUTPUT:

    - the value of the cyclotomic polynomial `\Phi_n` at `x`.

    ALGORITHM:

    - Reduce to the case that n is squarefree: use the identity

    .. MATH::

        \Phi_n(x) = \Phi_q(x^{n/q})

    where `q` is the radical of `n`.

    - Use the identity

    .. MATH::

        \Phi_n(x) = \prod_{d | n} (x^d - 1)^{\mu(n / d)},

    where `\mu` is the Möbius function.

    - Handles the case that x^d = 1 for some d, but not the case that
      x^d - 1 is non-invertible: in this case polynomial evaluation is
      used instead.

    EXAMPLES::
