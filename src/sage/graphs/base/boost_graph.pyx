Interface to run Boost algorithms

Wrapper for a Boost graph. The Boost graphs are Cython C++ variables, and they
cannot be converted to Python objects: as a consequence, only functions defined
with cdef are able to create, read, modify, and delete these graphs.

A very important feature of Boost graph library is that all object are generic:
for instance, adjacency lists can be stored using different data structures,
and (most of) the functions work with all implementations provided. This feature
is implemented in our interface using fused types: however, Cython's support for
fused types is still experimental, and some features are missing. For instance,
there cannot be nested generic function calls, and no variable can have a
generic type, apart from the arguments of a generic function.

All the input functions use pointers, because otherwise we might have problems
with ``delete()``.

cpdef dominator_tree(g, root, return_dict = False):
    r"""
    Uses Boost to compute the dominator tree of ``g``, rooted at ``root``.

    A node `d` dominates a node `n` if every path from the entry node
    ``root`` to `n` must go through `d`. The immediate dominator of a node
    `n` is the unique node that strictly dominates `n` but does not dominate
    any other node that dominates `n`. A dominator tree is a tree where each
    node's children are those nodes it immediately dominates. For more
    information, see :wikipedia:`Dominator_(graph_theory)`.

    If the graph is connected and undirected, the parent of a vertex `v` is:

     - the root if `v` is in the same biconnected component as the root;

     - the first cut vertex in a path from `v` to the root, otherwise.

    If the graph is not connected, the dominator tree of the whole graph is
    equal to the dominator tree of the connected component of the root.

    If the graph is directed, computing a dominator tree is more complicated,
    and it needs time `O(m\log m)`, where `m` is the number of edges. The
    implementation provided by Boost is the most general one, so it needs time
    `O(m\log m)` even for undirected graphs.

    INPUT:

    - ``g`` (generic_graph) - the input graph.

    - ``root`` (vertex) - the root of the dominator tree.

    - ``return_dict`` (boolean) - if ``True``, the function returns a
      dictionary associating to each vertex its parent in the dominator
      tree. If ``False`` (default), it returns the whole tree, as a ``Graph``
      or a ``DiGraph``.

    OUTPUT:

    The dominator tree, as a graph or as a dictionary, depending on the
    value of ``return_dict``. If the output is a dictionary, it will contain
    ``None`` in correspondence of ``root`` and of vertices that are not
    reachable from ``root``. If the output is a graph, it will not contain
    vertices that are not reachable from ``root``.

    EXAMPLES:

    An undirected grid is biconnected, and its dominator tree is a star
    (everyone's parent is the root)::

        sage: g = graphs.GridGraph([2,2]).dominator_tree((0,0))
        sage: g.to_dictionary()
        {(0, 0): [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)], (0, 1): [(0, 0)], (1, 0): [(0, 0)], (1, 1): [(0, 0)]}

    If the graph is made by two 3-cycles `C_1,C_2` connected by an edge `(v,w)`,
    with `v \in C_1`, `w \in C_2`, the cut vertices are `v` and `w`, the
    biconnected components are `C_1`, `C_2`, and the edge `(v,w)`. If the root
    is in `C_1`, the parent of each vertex in `C_1` is the root, the parent of
    `w` is `v`, and the parent of each vertex in `C_2` is `w`::

         sage: G = 2 * graphs.CycleGraph(3)
         sage: v = 0
         sage: w = 3
         sage: G.add_edge(v,w)
         sage: G.dominator_tree(1, return_dict=True)
         {0: 1, 1: None, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 3, 5: 3}

        sage: g = digraphs.Circuit(10).dominator_tree(5)
        sage: g.to_dictionary()
        {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: [], 5: [6], 6: [7], 7: [8], 8: [9], 9: [0]}

        sage: graphs.GridGraph([2,2]).dominator_tree((0,0), return_dict = True)

cpdef bandwidth_heuristics(g, algorithm = 'cuthill_mckee'):
    r"""
    Uses Boost heuristics to approximate the bandwidth of the input graph.

    The bandwidth `bw(M)` of a matrix `M` is the smallest integer `k` such that
    all non-zero entries of `M` are at distance `k` from the diagonal. The
    bandwidth `bw(g)` of an undirected graph `g` is the minimum bandwidth of
    the adjacency matrix of `g`, over all possible relabellings of its vertices
    (for more information, see the
    :mod:`~sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.bandwidth`
    module).

    Unfortunately, exactly computing the bandwidth is NP-hard (and an
    exponential algorithm is implemented in Sagemath in routine
    :func:`~sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.bandwidth.bandwidth`). Here, we
    implement two heuristics to find good orderings: Cuthill-McKee, and King.

    This function works only in undirected graphs, and its running time is
    `O(md_{max}\log d_{max})` for the Cuthill-McKee ordering, and
    `O(md_{max}^2\log d_{max})` for the King ordering, where `m` is the number
    of edges, and `d_{max}` is the maximum degree in the graph.

    INPUT:

    - ``g`` (``Graph``) - the input graph.

    - ``algorithm`` (``'cuthill_mckee'`` or ``'king'``) - the heuristic used to
      compute the ordering: Cuthill-McKee, or King.

    OUTPUT:

    A pair ``[bandwidth, ordering]``, where ``ordering`` is the ordering of
    vertices, ``bandwidth`` is the bandwidth of that specific ordering (which
    is not necessarily the bandwidth of the graph, because this is a heuristic).
