Shard intersection order

This file builds a combinatorial version of the shard intersection
order of type A (in the classification of finite Coxeter groups). This
is a lattice on the set of permutations, closely related to
noncrossing partitions and the weak order.

For technical reasons, the elements of the posets are not permutations,
but can be easily converted from and to permutations::

    sage: from sage.combinat.shard_order import ShardPosetElement
    sage: p0 = Permutation([1,3,4,2])
    sage: e0 = ShardPosetElement(p0); e0
    (1, 3, 4, 2)
    sage: Permutation(list(e0)) == p0
    True

.. SEEALSO::

    A general implementation for all finite Coxeter groups is available as
    :meth:`~sage.categories.finite_coxeter_groups.FiniteCoxeterGroups.ParentMethods.shard_poset`

    An element of the shard poset.

    This is basically a permutation with extra stored arguments:

    - ``p`` -- the permutation itself as a tuple

    - ``run_indices`` -- a list ``integer -> index of the run``
    - ``dpg`` -- the transitive closure of the shard preorder graph
    - ``spg`` -- the transitive reduction of the shard preorder graph

    in the list of runs and the two intervals defined by the initial and

    This only depends on the initial and final indices of the runs.

    Return the shard intersection order on permutations of size `n`.

    This is defined on the set of permutations. To every permutation,

    relative positions.

    The shard intersection order is given by the implication (or refinement)
    order on the set of pre-orders defined from all permutations.

    This can also be seen in a geometrical way. Every pre-order defines
    a cone in a vector space of dimension `n`. The shard poset is given by
    the inclusion of these cones.
