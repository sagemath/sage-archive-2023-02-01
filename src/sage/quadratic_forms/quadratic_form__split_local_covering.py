def cholesky_decomposition(self, bit_prec = 53):
    r"""
    Give the Cholesky decomposition of this quadratic form `Q` as a real matrix
    of precision ``bit_prec``.

    RESTRICTIONS:

        Q must be given as a QuadraticForm defined over `\ZZ`, `\QQ`, or some
        real field. If it is over some real field, then an error is raised if
        the precision given is not less than the defined precision of the real
        field defining the quadratic form!

    REFERENCE:

        From Cohen's "A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory" book,
        p 103.

    INPUT:

        ``bit_prec`` -- a natural number (default 53).

    OUTPUT:

        an upper triangular real matrix of precision ``bit_prec``.


    TO DO:
        If we only care about working over the real double field (RDF), then we
        can use the ``cholesky()`` method present for square matrices over that.
