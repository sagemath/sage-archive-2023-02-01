Generate interpreters for fast_callable

AUTHORS:

- Carl Witty

This file is part of the Sage support for "planned" computations;
that is, computations that are separated into a planning stage and
a plan-execution stage.  Here, we generate fast interpreters for plan
executions.

There are at least two kinds of computations that are often planned in
this fashion.  First is arithmetic expression evaluation, where we
take an arbitrary user-specified arithmetic expression and compile it
into a bytecode form for fast interpretation.  Second is things like
FFTs and large multiplications, where large problems are split into
multiple smaller problems... we can do the logical "splitting" for a
given size only once, producing a plan which can be reused as often as
we want for different problems of the same size.  Currently only
arithmetic expression evaluation is implemented, but other kinds of
planned computations should be easy to add.

Typically, for arithmetic expressions, we want the storage of
intermediate results to be handled automatically (on a stack); for
FFTs/multiplications/etc., the planner will keep track of intermediate
results itself.

For arithmetic expression evaluation, we want to have lots of
interpreters (at least one, and possibly several, per
specially-handled type).  Also, for any given type, we have many
possible variants of instruction encoding, etc.; some of these could
be handled with conditional compilation, but some are more
complicated.  So we end up writing an interpreter generator.

We want to share as much code as possible across all of these
interpreters, while still maintaining the freedom to make drastic
changes in the interpretation strategy (which may change the
generated code, the calling convention for the interpreter, etc.)

To make this work, the interpreter back-end is divided into three
parts:

1. The interpreter itself, in C or C++.

2. The wrapper, which is a Cython object holding the
   constants, code, etc., and which actually calls the interpreter.

3. The code generator.

We generate parts 1 and 2.  The code generator is table-driven,
and we generate the tables for the code generator.

There are a lot of techniques for fast interpreters that we do not yet
use; hopefully at least some of these will eventually be implemented:

- using gcc's "labels as values" extension where available

- top-of-stack caching

- superinstructions and/or superoperators

- static stack caching

- context threading/subrouting threading

- selective inlining/dynamic superinstructions

- automatic replication

Interpreters may be stack-based or register-based.  Recent research
suggests that register-based interpreters are better, but the
researchers are investigating interpreters for entire programming
languages, rather than interpreters for expressions.  I suspect
that stack-based expression interpreters may be better.  However,
we'll implement both varieties and see what's best.

The relative costs of stack- and register-based interpreters will
depend on the costs of moving values.  For complicated types (like
mpz_t), a register-based interpreter will quite likely be better,
since it will avoid moving values.

We will NOT support any sort of storage of bytecode; instead, the
code must be re-generated from expression trees in every Sage run.
This means that we can trivially experiment with different styles of
interpreter, or even use quite different interpreters depending on
the architecture, without having to worry about forward and backward
compatibility.

    The first argument is the template string; remaining keyword

    If the first character in the template string is a newline, it is
    removed (this feature is useful when using multi-line templates defined
    with triple-quoted strings -- the first line doesn't have to be on
    the same line as the quotes, which would screw up the indentation).

    (This is very inefficient, because it recompiles the Jinja
    template on each call; don't use it in situations where
    performance is important.)

class StorageType(object):
    r"""
    A StorageType specifies the C types used to deal with values of a
    given type.

    We currently support three categories of types.

    First are the "simple" types.  These are types where: the
    representation is small, functions expect arguments to be passed
    by value, and the C/C++ assignment operator works.  This would
    include built-in C types (long, float, etc.) and small structs
    (like gsl_complex).

    Second is 'PyObject*'.  This is just like a simple type, except
    that we have to incref/decref at appropriate places.

    Third is "auto-reference" types.  This is how
    GMP/MPIR/MPFR/MPFI/FLINT types work.  For these types, functions
    expect arguments to be passed by reference, and the C assignment
    operator does not do what we want.  In addition, they take
    advantage of a quirk in C (where arrays are automatically
    converted to pointers) to automatically pass arguments by
    reference.

    Support for further categories would not be difficult to add (such
    as reference-counted types other than PyObject*, or
    pass-by-reference types that don't use the GMP auto-reference
    trick), if we ever run across a use for them.
    """

    def __init__(self):

        Initialize an instance of StorageType.

        This sets several properties:

        class_member_declarations:
        A string giving variable declarations that must be members of any
        wrapper class using this type.

        class_member_initializations:
        A string initializing the class_member_declarations; will be
        inserted into the __init__ method of any wrapper class using this
        type.

        local_declarations:
        A string giving variable declarations that must be local variables

    def cheap_copies(self):

        Returns True or False, depending on whether this StorageType
        supports cheap copies -- whether it is cheap to copy values of
        this type from one location to another.  This is true for
        primitive types, and for types like PyObject* (where you're only
        copying a pointer, and possibly changing some reference counts).
        It is false for types like mpz_t and mpfr_t, where copying values
        can involve arbitrarily much work (including memory allocation).

        The practical effect is that if cheap_copies is True,
        instructions with outputs of this type write the results into
        local variables, and the results are then copied to their
        final locations.  If cheap_copies is False, then the addresses
        of output locations are passed into the instruction and the
        instruction writes outputs directly in the final location.

    StorageTypePython is a subtype of StorageTypeAssignable that deals

    Just allocating an array full of PyObject* leads to problems,
    because the Python garbage collector must be able to get to every
    Python object, and it wouldn't know how to get to these arrays.
    So we allocate the array as a Python list, but then we immediately
    pull the ob_item out of it and deal only with that from then on.

    We often leave these lists with NULL entries.  This is safe for
    the garbage collector and the deallocator, which is all we care
    about; but it would be unsafe to provide Python-level access to
    these lists.

    There is one special thing about StorageTypePython: memory that is
    used by the interpreter as scratch space (for example, the stack)
    must be cleared after each call (so we don't hold on to
    potentially-large objects and waste memory).  Since we have to do
    this anyway, the interpreter gains a tiny bit of speed by assuming
    that the scratch space is cleared on entry; for example, when
    pushing a value onto the stack, it doesn't bother to XDECREF the
    previous value because it's always NULL.

def params_gen(**chunks):
    r"""
    Instructions have a parameter specification that says where they get
    their inputs and where their outputs go.  Each parameter has
    the same form: it is a triple (chunk, addr, len).  The chunk says
    where the parameter is read from/written to.  The addr says which
    value in the chunk is used.  If the chunk is a stack chunk, then
    addr must be null; the value will be read from/written to the top
    of the stack.  Otherwise, addr must be an integer, or another chunk;
    if addr is another chunk, then the next value is read from that chunk
    to be the address.

    The len says how many values to read/write.  It can be either None
    (meaning to read/write only a single value), an integer, or
    another chunk; if it is a chunk, then the next value is read from that
    chunk to be the len.  Note that specifying len changes the types
    given to the instruction, so len==None is different than len==1 even
    though both mean to use a single value.

    These parameter specifications are cumbersome to write by hand, so
    there's also a simple string format for them.  This (curried)
    function parses the simple string format and produces parameter
    specifications.  The params_gen function takes keyword arguments
    mapping single-character names to memory chunks.  The string format
    uses these names.  The params_gen function returns another function,
    that takes two strings and returns a pair of lists of parameter
    specifications.

    Each string is the concatenation of arbitrarily many specifications.
    Each specification consists of an address and a length.  The
    address is either a single character naming a stack chunk,
    or a string of the form 'A[B]' where A names a non-stack chunk
    and B names the code chunk.  The length is either empty, or '@n'
    for a number n (meaning to use that many arguments), or '@C', where
    C is the code chunk.

class InstrSpec(object):
    r"""
    Each instruction in an interpreter is represented as an InstrSpec.
    This contains all the information that we need to generate code
    to interpret the instruction; it also is used to build the tables
    that fast_callable uses, so this is the nexus point between
    users of the interpreter (possibly pure Python) and the
    generated C interpreter.

    The underlying instructions are matched to the caller by name.
    For instance, fast_callable assumes that if the interpreter has an
    instruction named 'cos', then it will take a single argument,
    return a single result, and implement the cos() function.

    The print representation of an instruction (which will probably
    only be used when doctesting this file) consists of the name,
    a simplified stack effect, and the code (truncated if it's long).
    The stack effect has two parts, the input and the output, separated
    by '->'; the input shows what will be popped from the stack,
    the output what will be placed on the stack.  Each consists of
    a sequence of 'S' and '*' characters, where 'S' refers to a single
    argument and '*' refers to a variable number of arguments.

    The code for an instruction is a small snippet of C code.  It has
    available variables 'i0', 'i1', ..., 'o0', 'o1', ...; one variable
    for each input and output; its job is to assign values to the output
    variables, based on the values of the input variables.

    Normally, in an interpreter that uses doubles, each of the input
    and output variables will be a double.  If i0 actually represents
    a variable number of arguments, then it will be a pointer to
    double instead, and there will be another variable n_i0 giving
    the actual number of arguments.

    When instructions refer to auto-reference types, they actually
    get a pointer to the data in its original location; it is
    not copied into a local variable.  Mostly, this makes no difference,
    but there is one potential problem to be aware of.  It is possible
    for an output variable to point to the same object as an input
    variable; in fact, this usually will happen when you're working
    with the stack.  If the instruction maps to a single function call,
    then this is fine; the standard auto-reference implementations
    (GMP, MPFR, etc.) are careful to allow having the input and output
    be the same.  But if the instruction maps to multiple function
    calls, you may need to use a temporary variable.

    Here's an example of this issue.  Suppose you want to make an
    instruction that does ``out = a+b*c``.  You write code like this::

        out = b*c
        out = a+out

    But out will actually share the same storage as a; so the first line
    modifies a, and you actually end up computing 2*(b+c).  The fix
    is to only write to the output once, at the very end of your
    instruction.

    Instructions are also allowed to access memory chunks (other than
    the stack and code) directly.  They are available as C variables
    with the same name as the chunk.  This is useful if some type of
    memory chunk doesn't fit well with the params_gen interface.

    There are additional reference-counting rules that must be
    followed if your interpreter operates on Python objects; these
    rules are described in the docstring of the PythonInterpreter
    class.

        That py_call instruction is particularly interesting, and
        demonstrates a useful technique to let you use Cython code
        in an interpreter.  Let's look more closely::

            sage: print(instrs['py_call'].code)
            if (!rr_py_call_helper(domain, i0, n_i1, i1, o0)) {
              goto error;
            }

        This instruction makes use of the function ``rr_py_call_helper``,
        which is declared in ``wrapper_rr.h``::

            sage: print(interp.c_header)
            <BLANKLINE>
            #include <mpfr.h>
            #include "interpreters/wrapper_rr.h"
            <BLANKLINE>

        The function ``rr_py_call_helper`` is implemented in Cython::

            sage: print(interp.pyx_header)
            # distutils: libraries = mpfr gmp
            <BLANKLINE>
            cdef public bint rr_py_call_helper(object domain, object fn,
                                               int n_args,
                                               mpfr_t* args, mpfr_t retval) except 0:
                py_args = []
                cdef int i
                cdef RealNumber rn
                for i from 0 <= i < n_args:
                    rn = domain()
                    mpfr_set(rn.value, args[i], MPFR_RNDN)
                    py_args.append(rn)
                cdef RealNumber result = domain(fn(*py_args))
                mpfr_set(retval, result.value, MPFR_RNDN)
                return 1


        So instructions where you need to interact with Python can
        call back into Cython code fairly easily.

class PythonInterpreter(StackInterpreter):
    r"""
    A subclass of StackInterpreter, specifying an interpreter over
    Python objects.

    Let's discuss how the reference-counting works in Python-object
    based interpreters.

    There is a simple rule to remember: when executing the code
    snippets, the input variables contain borrowed references;
    you must fill in the output variables with references you own.

    As an optimization, an instruction may set .handles_own_decref; in
    that case, it must decref any input variables that came from the
    stack.  (Input variables that came from arguments/constants chunks
    must NOT be decref'ed!)  In addition, with .handles_own_decref, if
    any of your input variables are arbitrary-count, then you must
    NULL out these variables as you decref them.  (Use Py_CLEAR to do
    this, unless you understand the documentation of Py_CLEAR and why
    it's different than Py_XDECREF followed by assigning NULL.)

    Note that as a tiny optimization, the interpreter always assumes
    (and ensures) that empty parts of the stack contain NULL, so
    it doesn't bother to Py_XDECREF before it pushes onto the stack.

    def get_interpreter(self):
        r"""
        Return the code for the C interpreter.

        EXAMPLES:

        First we get the InterpreterSpec for several interpreters::

            sage: from sage_setup.autogen.interpreters import *
            sage: rdf_spec = RDFInterpreter()
            sage: rr_spec = RRInterpreter()
            sage: el_spec = ElementInterpreter()

        Then we get the actual interpreter code::

            sage: rdf_interp = InterpreterGenerator(rdf_spec).get_interpreter()
            sage: rr_interp = InterpreterGenerator(rr_spec).get_interpreter()
            sage: el_interp = InterpreterGenerator(el_spec).get_interpreter()

        Now we can look through these interpreters.

        Each interpreter starts with a file header; this can be
        customized on a per-interpreter basis::

            sage: print(rr_interp)
            /* Automatically generated by ... */
            ...

        Next is the function header, with one argument per memory chunk
        in the interpreter spec::

            sage: print(el_interp)
            /* ... */ ...
            PyObject* interp_el(PyObject** args,
                    PyObject** constants,
                    PyObject** stack,
                    PyObject* domain,
                    int* code) {
            ...

        Currently, the interpreters have a very simple structure; just
        grab the next instruction and execute it, in a switch
        statement::

            sage: print(rdf_interp)
            /* ... */ ...
              while (1) {
                switch (*code++) {
            ...

        Then comes the code for each instruction.  Here is one of the
        simplest instructions::

            sage: print(rdf_interp)
            /* ... */ ...
                case 10: /* neg */
                  {
                    double i0 = *--stack;
                    double o0;
                    o0 = -i0;
                    *stack++ = o0;
                  }
                  break;
            ...

        We simply pull the top of the stack into a variable, negate it,
        and write the result back onto the stack.

        Let's look at the MPFR-based version of this instruction.
        This is an example of an interpreter with an auto-reference
        type::

            sage: print(rr_interp)
            /* ... */ ...
                case 10: /* neg */
                  {
                    mpfr_ptr i0 = *--stack;
                    mpfr_ptr o0 = *stack++;
                    mpfr_neg(o0, i0, MPFR_RNDN);
                  }
                  break;
            ...

        Here we see that the input and output variables are actually
        just pointers into the stack.  But due to the auto-reference
        trick, the actual code snippet, ``mpfr_net(o0, i0, MPFR_RNDN);``,
        is exactly the same as if i0 and o0 were declared as local
        mpfr_t variables.

        For completeness, let's look at this instruction in the
        Python-object element interpreter::

            sage: print(el_interp)
            /* ... */ ...
                case 10: /* neg */
                  {
                    PyObject* i0 = *--stack;
                    *stack = NULL;
                    PyObject* o0;
                    o0 = PyNumber_Negative(i0);
                    Py_DECREF(i0);
                    if (!CHECK(o0)) {
                      Py_XDECREF(o0);
                      goto error;
                    }
                    *stack++ = o0;
                  }
                  break;
            ...

        The original code snippet was only ``o0 = PyNumber_Negative(i0);``;
        all the rest is automatically generated.  For ElementInterpreter,
        the CHECK macro actually checks for an exception (makes sure that
        o0 is not NULL), tests if the o0 is an element with the correct
        parent, and if not converts it into the correct parent.  (That is,
        it can potentially modify the variable o0.)

        Return the code for the Cython wrapper.

        EXAMPLES:

        First we get the InterpreterSpec for several interpreters::

            sage: from sage_setup.autogen.interpreters import *
            sage: rdf_spec = RDFInterpreter()
            sage: rr_spec = RRInterpreter()
            sage: el_spec = ElementInterpreter()

        Then we get the actual wrapper code::

            sage: rdf_wrapper = InterpreterGenerator(rdf_spec).get_wrapper()
            sage: rr_wrapper = InterpreterGenerator(rr_spec).get_wrapper()
            sage: el_wrapper = InterpreterGenerator(el_spec).get_wrapper()

        Now we can look through these wrappers.

        Each wrapper starts with a file header; this can be
        customized on a per-interpreter basis (some blank lines have been
        elided below)::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # Automatically generated by ...
            include "sage/ext/stdsage.pxi"
            from cpython.ref cimport PyObject
            cdef extern from "Python.h":
                void Py_DECREF(PyObject *o)
                void Py_INCREF(PyObject *o)
                void Py_CLEAR(PyObject *o)
            <BLANKLINE>
                object PyList_New(Py_ssize_t len)
                ctypedef struct PyListObject:
                    PyObject **ob_item
            <BLANKLINE>
                ctypedef struct PyTupleObject:
                    PyObject **ob_item
            <BLANKLINE>
            from sage.ext.fast_callable cimport Wrapper
            ...

        We need a way to propagate exceptions back to the wrapper,
        even though we only return a double from interp_rdf.  The
        ``except? -1094648009105371`` (that's a randomly chosen
        number) means that we will return that number if there's an
        exception, but the wrapper still has to check whether that's a
        legitimate return or an exception.  (Cython does this
        automatically.)

        Next comes the actual wrapper class.  The member declarations
        are in the corresponding pxd file; see the documentation for
        get_pxd to see them::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
            cdef class Wrapper_rdf(Wrapper):
                # attributes are declared in corresponding .pxd file
            ...

        Next is the __init__ method, which starts like this::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
                def __init__(self, args):
                    Wrapper.__init__(self, args, metadata)
                    cdef int i
                    cdef int count
            ...

        To make it possible to generate code for all expression
        interpreters with a single code generator, all wrappers
        have the same API.  The __init__ method takes a single
        argument (here called *args*), which is a dictionary holding
        all the information needed to initialize this wrapper.

        We call Wrapper.__init__, which saves a copy of this arguments
        object and of the interpreter metadata in the wrapper.  (This is
        only used for debugging.)

        Now we allocate memory for each memory chunk.  (We allocate
        the memory here, and reuse it on each call of the
        wrapper/interpreter.  This is for speed reasons; in a fast
        interpreter like RDFInterpreter, there are no memory allocations
        involved in a call of the wrapper, except for the ones that
        are required by the Python calling convention.  Eventually
        we will support alternate Cython-only entry points that do
        absolutely no memory allocation.)

        Basically the same code is repeated, with minor variations, for
        each memory chunk; for brevity, we'll only show the code
        for 'constants'::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
                    val = args['constants']
                    self._n_constants = len(val)
                    self._constants = <double*>sage_malloc(sizeof(double) * len(val))
                    if self._constants == NULL: raise MemoryError
                    for i in range(len(val)):
                        self._constants[i] = val[i]
            ...

        Recall that _n_constants is an int, and _constants is a
        double*.

        The RRInterpreter version is more complicated, because it has to
        call mpfr_init::

            sage: print(rr_wrapper)
            # ...
                    cdef RealNumber rn
            ...
                    val = args['constants']
                    self._n_constants = len(val)
                    self._constants = <mpfr_t*>sage_malloc(sizeof(mpfr_t) * len(val))
                    if self._constants == NULL: raise MemoryError
                    for i in range(len(val)):
                        mpfr_init2(self._constants[i], self.domain.prec())
                    for i in range(len(val)):
                        rn = self.domain(val[i])
                        mpfr_set(self._constants[i], rn.value, MPFR_RNDN)
            ...

        And as described in the documentation for get_pxd, in
        Python-object based interpreters we actually allocate the
        memory as a Python list::

            sage: print(el_wrapper)
            # ...
                    val = args['constants']
                    self._n_constants = len(val)
                    self._list_constants = PyList_New(self._n_constants)
                    self._constants = (<PyListObject *>self._list_constants).ob_item
                    for i in range(len(val)):
                        self._constants[i] = <PyObject *>val[i]; Py_INCREF(self._constants[i])
            ...

        Of course, once we've allocated the memory, we eventually have
        to free it.  (Again, we'll only look at 'constants'.)::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
                def __dealloc__(self):
            ...
                    if self._constants:
                        sage_free(self._constants)
            ...

        The RRInterpreter code is more complicated again because it has
        to call mpfr_clear::

            sage: print(rr_wrapper)
            # ...
                def __dealloc__(self):
                    cdef int i
            ...
                    if self._constants:
                        for i in range(self._n_constants):
                            mpfr_clear(self._constants[i])
                        sage_free(self._constants)
            ...

        But the ElementInterpreter code is extremely simple --
        it doesn't have to do anything to deallocate constants!
        (Since the memory for constants is actually allocated as a
        Python list, and Cython knows how to deallocate Python lists.)

        Finally we get to the __call__ method.  We grab the arguments
        passed by the caller, stuff them in our pre-allocated
        argument array, and then call the C interpreter.

        We optionally adjust the return value of the interpreter
        (currently only the RDF/float interpreter performs this step;
        this is the only place where domain=RDF differs than
        domain=float)::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
                def __call__(self, *args):
                    if self._n_args != len(args): raise ValueError
                    cdef double* c_args = self._args
                    cdef int i
                    for i from 0 <= i < len(args):
                        self._args[i] = args[i]
                    return self._domain(interp_rdf(c_args
                        , self._constants
                        , self._py_constants
                        , self._stack
                        , self._code
                        ))
            ...

        In Python-object based interpreters, the call to the C
        interpreter has to be a little more complicated.  We don't
        want to hold on to Python objects from an old computation by
        leaving them referenced from the stack.  In normal operation,
        the C interpreter clears out the stack as it runs, leaving the
        stack totally clear when the interpreter finishes.  However,
        this doesn't happen if the C interpreter raises an exception.
        In that case, we have to clear out any remnants from the stack
        in the wrapper::

            sage: print(el_wrapper)
            # ...
                    try:
                        return interp_el((<PyListObject*>mapped_args).ob_item
                            , self._constants
                            , self._stack
                            , <PyObject*>self._domain
                            , self._code
                            )
                    except BaseException:
                        for i in range(self._n_stack):
                            Py_CLEAR(self._stack[i])
                        raise
            ...

        Finally, we define a cdef call_c method, for quickly calling
        this object from Cython.  (The method is omitted from
        Python-object based interpreters.)::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
                cdef bint call_c(self,
                                 double* args,
                                 double* result) except 0:
                    result[0] = interp_rdf(args
                        , self._constants
                        , self._py_constants
                        , self._stack
                        , self._code
                        )
                    return 1
            ...

        The method for the RR interpreter is slightly different, because
        the interpreter takes a pointer to a result location instead of
        returning the value::

            sage: print(rr_wrapper)
            # ...
                cdef bint call_c(self,
                                 mpfr_t* args,
                                 mpfr_t result) except 0:
                    interp_rr(args
                        , result
                        , self._constants
                        , self._py_constants
                        , self._stack
                        , self._code
                        , <PyObject*>self._domain
                        )
                    return 1
            ...

        That's it for the wrapper class.  The only thing remaining is
        the interpreter metadata.  This is the information necessary
        for the code generator to map instruction names to opcodes; it
        also gives information about stack usage, etc.  This is fully
        documented at InterpreterMetadata; for now, we'll just show
        what it looks like.

        Currently, there are three parts to the metadata; the first maps
        instruction names to instruction descriptions.  The second one
        maps opcodes to instruction descriptions.  Note that we don't
        use InstrSpec objects here; instead, we use CompilerInstrSpec
        objects, which are much simpler and contain only the information
        we'll need at runtime.  The third part says what range the
        ipow instruction is defined over.

        First the part that maps instruction names to
        (CompilerInstrSpec, opcode) pairs::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
            from sage.ext.fast_callable import CompilerInstrSpec, InterpreterMetadata
            metadata = InterpreterMetadata(by_opname={
            ...
              'return':
              (CompilerInstrSpec(1, 0, []), 2),
              'py_call':
              (CompilerInstrSpec(0, 1, ['py_constants', 'n_inputs']), 3),
              'pow':
              (CompilerInstrSpec(2, 1, []), 4),
              'add':
              (CompilerInstrSpec(2, 1, []), 5),
            ...
             }, ...)

        There's also a table that maps opcodes to (instruction name,
        CompilerInstrSpec) pairs::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
            metadata = InterpreterMetadata(...,  by_opcode=[
            ...
              ('return',
               CompilerInstrSpec(1, 0, [])),
              ('py_call',
               CompilerInstrSpec(0, 1, ['py_constants', 'n_inputs'])),
              ('pow',
               CompilerInstrSpec(2, 1, [])),
              ('add',
               CompilerInstrSpec(2, 1, [])),
            ...
             ], ...)

        And then the ipow range::

            sage: print(rdf_wrapper)
            # ...
            metadata = InterpreterMetadata(...,
              ipow_range=(-2147483648, 2147483647))

        And that's it for the wrapper.

            from sage.rings.real_mpfr cimport RealField_class, RealNumber
            from sage.libs.mpfr cimport *
            ...

        Next and last is the declaration of the wrapper class, which
        starts off with a list of member declarations::

            sage: print(rdf_pxd)
            # ...
            cdef class Wrapper_rdf(Wrapper):
                cdef int _n_args
                cdef double* _args
                cdef int _n_constants
                cdef double* _constants
                cdef object _list_py_constants
                cdef int _n_py_constants
                cdef PyObject** _py_constants
                cdef int _n_stack
                cdef double* _stack
                cdef int _n_code
                cdef int* _code
            ...

        Contrast the declaration of ``_stack`` here with the
        ElementInterpreter version.  To simplify our handling of
        reference counting and garbage collection, in a Python-object
        based interpreter, we allocate arrays as Python lists,
        and then pull the array out of the innards of the list::

            sage: print(el_pxd)
            # ...
                cdef object _list_stack
                cdef int _n_stack
                cdef PyObject** _stack
            ...

        Then, at the end of the wrapper class, we declare a cdef method
        for quickly calling the wrapper object from Cython.  (This method
        is omitted from Python-object based interpreters.)::

            sage: print(rdf_pxd)
            # ...
                cdef bint call_c(self,
                                 double* args,
                                 double* result) except 0
            sage: print(rr_pxd)
            # ...
                cdef bint call_c(self,
                                 mpfr_t* args,
                                 mpfr_t result) except 0
