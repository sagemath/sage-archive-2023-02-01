Toric lattices

This module was designed as a part of the framework for toric varieties
(:mod:`~sage.schemes.toric.variety`,
:mod:`~sage.schemes.toric.fano_variety`).

All toric lattices are isomorphic to `\ZZ^n` for some `n`, but will prevent
you from doing "wrong" operations with objects from different lattices.

EXAMPLES:

The simplest way to create a toric lattice is to specify its dimension only::

    sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
    sage: N
    3-d lattice N

While our lattice ``N`` is called exactly "N" it is a coincidence: all
lattices are called "N" by default::

    sage: another_name = ToricLattice(3)
    sage: another_name
    3-d lattice N

If fact, the above lattice is exactly the same as before as an object in
memory::

    sage: N is another_name
    True

There are actually four names associated to a toric lattice and they all must
be the same for two lattices to coincide::

    sage: N, N.dual(), latex(N), latex(N.dual())
    (3-d lattice N, 3-d lattice M, N, M)

Notice that the lattice dual to ``N`` is called "M" which is standard in toric
geometry. This happens only if you allow completely automatic handling of
names::

    sage: another_N = ToricLattice(3, "N")
    sage: another_N.dual()
    3-d lattice N*
    sage: N is another_N
    False

What can you do with toric lattices? Well, their main purpose is to allow
creation of elements of toric lattices::

    sage: n = N([1,2,3])
    sage: n
    N(1, 2, 3)
    sage: M = N.dual()
    sage: m = M(1,2,3)
    sage: m
    M(1, 2, 3)

Dual lattices can act on each other::

    sage: n * m
    14
    sage: m * n
    14

You can also add elements of the same lattice or scale them::

    sage: 2 * n
    N(2, 4, 6)
    sage: n * 2
    N(2, 4, 6)
    sage: n + n
    N(2, 4, 6)

However, you cannot "mix wrong lattices" in your expressions::

    sage: n + m
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+':
    '3-d lattice N' and '3-d lattice M'
    sage: n * n
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: elements of the same toric lattice cannot be multiplied!
    sage: n == m
    False

Note that ``n`` and ``m`` are not equal to each other even though they are
both "just (1,2,3)." Moreover, you cannot easily convert elements between
toric lattices::

    sage: M(n)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: N(1, 2, 3) cannot be converted to 3-d lattice M!

If you really need to consider elements of one lattice as elements of another,
you can either use intermediate conversion to "just a vector"::

    sage: ZZ3 = ZZ^3
    sage: n_in_M = M(ZZ3(n))
    sage: n_in_M
    M(1, 2, 3)
    sage: n == n_in_M
    False
    sage: n_in_M == m
    True

Or you can create a homomorphism from one lattice to any other::

    sage: h = N.hom(identity_matrix(3), M)
    sage: h(n)
    M(1, 2, 3)

.. WARNING::

    While integer vectors (elements of `\ZZ^n`) are printed as ``(1,2,3)``,
    in the code ``(1,2,3)`` is a :class:`tuple`, which has nothing to do
    neither with vectors, nor with toric lattices, so the following is
    probably not what you want while working with toric geometry objects::

        sage: (1,2,3) + (1,2,3)
        (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

    Instead, use syntax like ::

        sage: N(1,2,3) + N(1,2,3)
        N(2, 4, 6)

    A toric lattice is uniquely determined by its rank and associated names.
    There are four such "associated names" whose meaning should be clear from
    the names of the corresponding parameters, but the choice of default
    values is a little bit involved. So here is the full description of the
    "naming algorithm":

    #. If no names were given at all, then this lattice will be called "N" and
       the dual one "M". These are the standard choices in toric geometry.

    #. If ``name`` was given and ``dual_name`` was not, then ``dual_name``
       will be ``name`` followed by "*".

    #. If LaTeX names were not given, they will coincide with the "usual"
       names, but if ``dual_name`` was constructed automatically, the trailing
       star will be typeset as a superscript.

    EXAMPLES:

    Let's start with no names at all and see how automatic names are given::

        sage: L1 = ToricLattice(3)
        sage: L1
        3-d lattice N
        sage: L1.dual()
        3-d lattice M

    If we give the name "N" explicitly, the dual lattice will be called "N*"::

        sage: L2 = ToricLattice(3, "N")
        sage: L2
        3-d lattice N
        sage: L2.dual()
        3-d lattice N*

    However, we can give an explicit name for it too::

        sage: L3 = ToricLattice(3, "N", "M")
        sage: L3
        3-d lattice N
        sage: L3.dual()
        3-d lattice M

    If you want, you may also give explicit LaTeX names::

        sage: L4 = ToricLattice(3, "N", "M", r"\mathbb{N}", r"\mathbb{M}")
        sage: latex(L4)
        \mathbb{N}
        sage: latex(L4.dual())
        \mathbb{M}

    While all four lattices above are called "N", only two of them are equal
    (and are actually the same)::

        sage: L1 == L2
        False
        sage: L1 == L3
        True
        sage: L1 is L3
        True
        sage: L1 == L4
        False

    The reason for this is that ``L2`` and ``L4`` have different names either
    for dual lattices or for LaTeX typesetting.

        Return the quotient of ``self`` by the given sublattice ``sub``.

        INPUT:

        - ``sub`` -- sublattice of self;

        - ``check`` -- (default: True) whether or not to check that ``sub`` is
          a valid sublattice.

        If the quotient is one-dimensional and torsion free, the
        following two mutually exclusive keyword arguments are also
        allowed. They decide the sign choice for the (single)
        generator of the quotient lattice:

        - ``positive_point`` -- a lattice point of ``self`` not in the
          sublattice ``sub`` (that is, not zero in the quotient
          lattice). The quotient generator will be in the same
          direction as ``positive_point``.

        - ``positive_dual_point`` -- a dual lattice point. The
          quotient generator will be chosen such that its lift has a
          positive product with ``positive_dual_point``. Note: if
          ``positive_dual_point`` is not zero on the sublattice
          ``sub``, then the notion of positivity will depend on the
          choice of lift!

        However, if we forget the sublattice structure, then it is
        possible to quotient by vector spaces or modules constructed
        from any sublattice::

class ToricLattice_quotient(FGP_Module_class):
    r"""
    Construct the quotient of a toric lattice ``V`` by its sublattice ``W``.

    INPUT:

    - ``V`` -- ambient toric lattice;

    - ``W`` -- sublattice of ``V``;

    - ``check`` -- (default: ``True``) whether to check correctness of input
      or not.

    If the quotient is one-dimensional and torsion free, the following
    two mutually exclusive keyword arguments are also allowed. They
    decide the sign choice for the (single) generator of the quotient
    lattice:

    - ``positive_point`` -- a lattice point of ``self`` not in the
      sublattice ``sub`` (that is, not zero in the quotient
      lattice). The quotient generator will be in the same direction
      as ``positive_point``.

    - ``positive_dual_point`` -- a dual lattice point. The quotient
      generator will be chosen such that its lift has a positive
      product with ``positive_dual_point``. Note: if
      ``positive_dual_point`` is not zero on the sublattice ``sub``,
      then the notion of positivity will depend on the choice of lift!

    OUTPUT:

    - quotient of ``V`` by ``W``.

    EXAMPLES:

    The intended way to get objects of this class is to use
    :meth:`quotient` method of toric lattices::

        (N[0, 0, 1],)

    Here, ``sublattice`` happens to be of codimension one in ``N``. If
    you want to prescribe the sign of the quotient generator, you can
    do either::
