Tutorial: visualizing root systems

Root systems encode the positions of collections of hyperplanes in
space, and form the fundamental combinatorial data underlying Coxeter
and Weyl groups, Lie algebras and groups, etc. The theory can be a bit
intimidating at first because of the many technical gadgets (roots,
coroots, weights, ...). Vizualizing them goes a long way toward
building a geometric intuition.

This tutorial starts from simple plots and guides you all the way to
advanced plots with your own combinatorial data drawn on top of it.

      -- the main plotting function, with pointers to all the subroutines


First plots
-----------

In this first plot, we draw the root system for type `A_2` in the
ambient space. It is generated from two hyperplanes at a 120 degree
angle::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot()

Each of those hyperplane `H_{\alpha^\vee_i}` is described by a linear
form `\alpha_i^\vee` called simple coroot. To each such hyperplane
corresponds a reflection along a vector called root. In this picture,
the reflections are orthogonal and the two simple roots `\alpha_1` and
`\alpha_2` are vectors which are normal to the reflection hyperplanes.
The same color code is used uniformly: blue for 1, red for 2, green
for 3, ... (see :meth:`CartanType.color()
<sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type.CartanTypeFactory.color>`). The
fundamental weights, `\Lambda_1` and `\Lambda_2` form the dual basis of
the coroots.

The two reflections generate a group of order six which is nothing but
the usual symmetric group `S_3`, in its natural action by permutations
of the coordinates of the ambient space. Wait, but the ambient space
should be of dimension `3` then? That's perfectly right. Here is the
full picture in 3D::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot(projection=False)

However in this space, the line `(1,1,1)` is fixed by the action of
the group. Therefore, the so called barycentric projection orthogonal
to `(1,1,1)` gives a convenient 2D picture which contains all the
essential information. The same projection is used by default in type
`G_2`::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["G",2]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes="all")

The group is now the dihedral group of order 12, generated by the two
reflections `s_1` and `s_2`. The picture displays the hyperplanes for
all 12 reflections of the group. Those reflections delimit 12 chambers
which are in one to one correspondance with the elements of the
group. The fundamental chamber, which is grayed out, is associated
with the identity of the group.

.. WARNING::

    The fundamental chamber is currently plotted as the cone generated
    by the fundamental weights. As can be seen on the previous 3D
    picture this is not quite correct if the fundamental weights do
    not span the space.

    Another caveat is that some plotting features may require
    manipulating elements with rational coordinates which will fail if
    one is working in, say, the weight lattice. It is therefore
    recommended to use the root, weight, or ambient spaces for
    plotting purposes rather than their lattice counterparts.

Coming back to the symmetric group, here is the picture in the weight
space, with all roots and all reflection hyperplanes; remark that,
unlike in the ambient space, a root is not necessarily orthogonal to
its corresponding reflection hyperplane::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2]).weight_space()
    sage: L.plot(roots = "all", reflection_hyperplanes="all").show(figsize=15)

.. NOTE::

    Setting a larger figure size as above can help reduce
    the overlap between the text labels when the figure
    gets crowded.

One can further customize which roots to display, as in
the following example showing the positive roots in the
weight space for type ['G',2], labelled by their
coordinates in the root lattice::

    sage: Q = RootSystem(["G",2]).root_space()
    sage: L = RootSystem(["G",2]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot(roots=list(Q.positive_roots()), fundamental_weights=False)

One can also customize the projection by specifying a function. Here,
we display all the roots for type `E_8` using the projection from its
eight dimensional ambient space onto 3D described on
:wikipedia:`Wikipedia's E8 3D picture <File:E8_3D.png>`::

    sage: M = matrix([[0., -0.556793440452, 0.19694925177, -0.19694925177, 0.0805477263944, -0.385290876171, 0., 0.385290876171],
    ...               [0.180913155536, 0., 0.160212955043, 0.160212955043, 0., 0.0990170516545, 0.766360424875, 0.0990170516545],
    ...               [0.338261212718, 0, 0, -0.338261212718, 0.672816364803, 0.171502564281, 0, -0.171502564281]])
    sage: L = RootSystem(["E",8]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.dimension()
    8
    sage: L.plot(roots="all", reflection_hyperplanes=False, projection=lambda v: M*vector(v), labels=False) # long time

The projection function should be linear or affine, and return a
vector with rational coordinates. The rationale for the later
constraint is to allow for using the PPL exact library for
manipulating polytopes. Indeed exact calculations give cleaner
pictures (adjacent objects, intersection with the bounding box, ...).
Besides the interface to PPL is indeed currently faster than that for
CDD, and it is likely to become even more so.

.. TOPIC:: Exercise

    Draw all finite root systems in 2D, using the canonical projection
    onto their Coxeter plane. See
    `Stembridge's page <http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jrs/coxplane.html>`_.


Alcoves and chambers
--------------------

We now draw the root system for type `G_2`, with its alcoves (in
finite type, those really are the chambers) and the corresponding
elements of the Weyl group. We enlarge a bit the bounding box to make
sure everything fits in the picture::

    sage: RootSystem(["G",2]).ambient_space().plot(alcoves=True, alcove_labels=True, bounding_box=5)

The same picture in 3D, for type `B_3`::

    sage: RootSystem(["B",3]).ambient_space().plot(alcoves=True, alcove_labels=True)

.. TOPIC:: Exercise

    Can you spot the fundamental chamber? The fundamental weights? The
    simple roots? The longest element of the Weyl group?

Alcove pictures for affine types
--------------------------------

We now draw the usual alcove picture for affine type `A_2^{(1)}`::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot()                                     # long time

This picture is convenient because it is low dimensional and contains
most of the relevant information. Beside, by choosing the ambient
space, the elements of the Weyl group act as orthogonal affine
maps. In particular, reflections are usual (affine) orthogonal
reflections. However this is in fact only a slice of the real picture:
the Weyl group actually acts by linear maps on the full ambient
space. Those maps stabilize the so-called level `l` hyperplanes, and
we are visualizing here what's happening at level `1`. Here is the
full picture in 3D::

    sage: L.plot(bounding_box=[[-3,3],[-3,3],[-1,1]], affine=False) # long time

In fact, in type `A`, this really is a picture in 4D, but as usual the
barycentric projection kills the boring extra dimension for us.

It's usually more readable to only draw the intersection of the
reflection hyperplanes with the level `1` hyperplane::

    sage: L.plot(affine=False, level=1)                # long time

Such 3D pictures are useful to better understand technicalities, like
the fact that the fundamental weights do not necessarily all live at
level 1::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["G",2,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot(affine=False, level=1)

.. NOTE::

    Such pictures may tend to be a bit flat, and it may be helpful to
    play with the aspect_ratio and more generaly with the various
    options of the :meth:`~sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d.show`
    method::

        sage: p = L.plot(affine=False, level=1)
        sage: p.show(aspect_ratio=[1,1,2], frame=False)

.. TOPIC:: Exercise

    Draw the alcove picture at level 1, and compare the position of
    the fundamental weights and the vertices of the fundamental
    alcove.

As for finite root systems, the alcoves are indexed by the elements of
the Weyl group `W`. Two alcoves indexed by `u` and `v` respectively
share a wall if `u` and `v` are neighbors in the right Cayley graph:
`u = vs_i`; the color of that wall is given by `i`::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["C",2,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot(coroots="simple", alcove_labels=True) # long time

Even 2D pictures of the rank `1 + 1` cases can give some food for
thought. Here, we draw the root lattice, with the positive roots of
small height in the root poset::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",1,1]).root_lattice()
    sage: positive_roots = TransitiveIdealGraded(attrcall("pred"), L.simple_roots())
    sage: it = iter(positive_roots)
    sage: first_positive_roots = [it.next() for i in range(10)]
    sage: L.plot(roots=first_positive_roots, affine=False, alcoves=False)

.. TOPIC:: Exercises

    #. Use the same trick to draw the reflection hyperplanes in the
       weight lattice for the coroots of small height. Add the
       indexing of the alcoves by elements of the Weyl group.
       See below for a solution.

    #. Draw the positive roots in the weight lattice and in the
       extended weight lattice.

    #. Draw the reflection hyperplanes in the root lattice

    #. Recreate John Stembridge's
       `"Sandwich" arrangement pictures <http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jrs/archive.html>`_
       by choosing appropriate coroots for the reflection hyperplanes.

Here is a polished solution for the first exercise::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",1,1]).weight_space()
    sage: positive_coroots = TransitiveIdealGraded(attrcall("pred"), L.simple_coroots())
    sage: it = iter(positive_coroots)
    sage: first_positive_coroots = [it.next() for i in range(20)]
    sage: p = L.plot(fundamental_chamber=True, reflection_hyperplanes=first_positive_coroots,
    ...              affine=False, alcove_labels=1,
    ...              bounding_box=[[-9,9],[-1,2]],
    ...              projection=lambda x: matrix([[1,-1],[1,1]])*vector(x))
    sage: p.show(figsize=20)                           # long time


Higher dimension affine pictures
--------------------------------

We now do some plots for rank 4 affine types, at level 1. The space is
tiled by the alcoves, each of which is a 3D simplex::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",3,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, bounding_box=85/100) # long time

It is recommended to use a small bounding box here, for otherwise the
number of simplices grows quicker than what Sage can handle
smoothly. It can help to specify explicitly which alcoves to
visualize. Here is the fundamental alcove, specified by an element of
the Weyl group::

    sage: W = L.weyl_group()
    sage: L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, alcoves=[W.one()], bounding_box=2)

and the fundamental polygon, specified by the coordinates of its
center in the root lattice::

    sage: W = L.weyl_group()
    sage: L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, alcoves=[[0,0]], bounding_box=2)

Finally, we draw the alcoves in the classical fundamental chambers,
using that those are indexed by the elements of the Weyl group having
no other left descent than `0`. In order to see the inner structure,
we only draw the wireframe of the facets of the alcoves. Specifying
the ``wireframe`` option requires a more flexible syntax for plots
which will be explained later on in this tutorial::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["B",3,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: W = L.weyl_group()
    sage: alcoves = [~w for d in range(12) for w in W.affine_grassmannian_elements_of_given_length(d)]
    sage: p = L.plot_fundamental_chamber("classical")
    sage: p += L.plot_alcoves(alcoves=alcoves, wireframe=True)
    sage: p += L.plot_fundamental_weights()
    sage: p.show(frame=False)

.. TOPIC:: Exercises

    #. Draw the fundamental alcove in the ambient space, just by
       itself (no reflection hyperplane, root, ...).  The automorphism
       group of the Dynkin diagram for `A_3^{(1)}` (a cycle of length 4)
       is the dihedral group. Visualize the corresponding symmetries
       of the fundamental alcove.

    #. Draw the fundamental alcoves for the other rank 4 affine types,
       and recover the automorphism groups of their Dynkin diagram
       from the pictures.

Drawing on top of a root system plot
------------------------------------

The root system plots have been designed to be used as wallpaper on
top of which to draw more information. In the following example, we
draw an alcove walk, specified by a word of indices of simple
reflections, on top of the weight lattice in affine type `A_{2,1}`::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: w1 = [0,2,1,2,0,2,1,0,2,1,2,1,2,0,2,0,1,2,0]
    sage: L.plot(alcove_walk=w1, bounding_box=6)       # long time

Now, what about drawing several alcove walks, and specifying some
colors? A single do-it-all plot method would be cumbersome; so
instead, it is actually built on top of many methods (see the list
below) that can be called independently and combined at will::

    sage: L.plot_roots() + L.plot_reflection_hyperplanes()

.. NOTE::

    By default the axes are disabled in root system plots since they
    tend to polute the picture. Annoyingly they come back when
    combining them. Here is a workaround::

        sage: p = L.plot_roots() + L.plot_reflection_hyperplanes()
        sage: p.axes(False)
        sage: p

In order to specify common information for all the pieces of a root
system plot (choice of projection, bounding box, color code for the
index set, ...), the easiest is to create an option object using
:meth:`~sage.combinat.root_system.root_lattice_realizations.RootLatticeRealizations.ParentMethods.plot_parse_options`,
and pass it down to each piece. We use this to plot our two walks::

    sage: plot_options = L.plot_parse_options(bounding_box=[[-2,5],[-2,6]])
    sage: w2 = [2,1,2,0,2,0,2,1,2,0,1,2,1,2,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,1,2,0,2]
    sage: p = L.plot_alcoves(plot_options=plot_options) # long time
    sage: p += L.plot_alcove_walk(w1, color="green", plot_options=plot_options)
    sage: p += L.plot_alcove_walk(w2, color="orange", plot_options=plot_options)
    sage: p

And another with some foldings::

    sage: p += L.plot_alcove_walk([0,1,2,0,2,0,1,2,0,1],
    ...                           foldings= [False, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, True, False],
    ...                           color="purple")
    sage: p.axes(False)
    sage: p.show(figsize=20)

Here we show a weight at level `0` and the reduced word implementing
the translation by this weight::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: P = RootSystem(["A",2,1]).weight_space(extended=True)
    sage: Lambda = P.fundamental_weights()
    sage: t = 6*Lambda[1] - 2*Lambda[2] - 4*Lambda[0]
    sage: walk = L.reduced_word_of_translation(L(t))
    sage: plot_options = L.plot_parse_options(bounding_box=[[-2,5],[-2,5]])
    sage: p = L.plot(plot_options=plot_options)        # long time
    sage: p += L.plot_alcove_walk(walk, color="green", plot_options=plot_options)
    sage: p += plot_options.family_of_vectors({t: L(t)})
    sage: plot_options.finalize(p)
    sage: p

Note that the coloring of the translated alcove does not match with
that of the fundamental alcove: the translation actually lives in the
extended Weyl group and is the composition of the simple reflections
indexed by the alcove walk together with a rotation implementing an
automorphism of the Dynkin diagram.

We conclude with a rank `3 + 1` alcove walk::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["B",3,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: w3 = [0,2,1,3,2,0,2,1,0,2,3,1,2,1,3,2,0,2,0,1,2,0]
    sage: L.plot_fundamental_weights() + L.plot_reflection_hyperplanes(bounding_box=2) + L.plot_alcove_walk(w3)

.. TOPIC:: Exercise

    #. Draw the tiling of 3D space by the fundamental polygons for
       types A,B,C,D. Hints: use the ``wireframe`` option of
       :meth:`RootLatticeRealizations.ParentMethods.plot_alcoves` and
       the ``color`` option of :meth:`plot` to only draw the alcove
       facets indexed by `0`.

.. TOPIC:: Solution

    ::

        sage: L = RootSystem(["A",3,1]).ambient_space()
        sage: alcoves = CartesianProduct([0,1],[0,1],[0,1])
        sage: color = lambda i: "black" if i==0 else None
        sage: L.plot_alcoves(alcoves=alcoves, color=color, bounding_box=10,wireframe=True).show(frame=False) # long time

Hand drawing on top of a root system plot (aka Coxeter graph paper)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Taken from John Stembridge's excellent
`data archive <http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jrs/archive.html>`_:

"If you've ever worked with affine reflection groups, you've probably
wasted lots of time drawing the reflecting hyperplanes of the rank 2
groups on scraps of paper. You may also have wished you had pads of
graph paper with these lines drawn in for you. If so, you've come to
the right place. Behold! Coxeter graph paper!".

Now you can create your own customized color Coxeter graph paper::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["C",2,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: p = L.plot(bounding_box=[[-8,9],[-5,7]], coroots="simple") # long time (10 s)
    sage: p

By default Sage's plot are bitmap pictures which would come out ugly
if printed on paper. Instead, we recommend saving the picture in
postscript or svg before printing it::

    sage: p.save("C21paper.eps")        # not tested

.. NOTE::

    Drawing pictures with a large number of alcoves is currently
    somewhat ridiculously slow. This is due to the use of generic code
    that works uniformly in all dimension rather than taylor-made code
    for 2D. Things should improve with the upcoming fast interface to
    the PPL library (see e.g. :trac:`12553`).

Drawing custom objects on top of a root system plot
---------------------------------------------------

So far so good. Now, what if one wants to draw, on top of a root
system plot, some object for which there is no preexisting plot
method? Again, the ``plot_options`` object come in handy, as it can be
used to compute appropriate coordinates. Here we draw the
permutohedron, that is the Cayley graph of the symmetric group `W`, by
positioning each element `w` at `w(\rho)`, where `\rho` is in the
fundamental alcove::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2]).ambient_space()
    sage: rho = L.rho()
    sage: plot_options = L.plot_parse_options()
    sage: W = L.weyl_group()
    sage: g = W.cayley_graph(side="right")
    sage: positions = {w: plot_options.projection(w.action(rho)) for w in W}
    sage: p = L.plot_alcoves()
    sage: p += g.plot(pos = positions, vertex_size=0,
    ...               color_by_label=plot_options.color)
    sage: p.axes(False)
    sage: p

.. TODO:: Could we have nice `\LaTeX` labels in this graph?

The same picture for `A_3` gives a nice 3D permutohedron::

    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",3]).ambient_space()
    sage: rho = L.rho()
    sage: plot_options = L.plot_parse_options()
    sage: W = L.weyl_group()
    sage: g = W.cayley_graph(side="right")
    sage: positions = {w: plot_options.projection(w.action(rho)) for w in W}
    sage: p = L.plot_roots()
    sage: p += g.plot3d(pos3d = positions, color_by_label=plot_options.color)
    sage: p

.. TOPIC:: Exercises

    #. Locate the identity element of `W` in the previous picture

    #. Rotate the picture appropriately to highlight the
       various symmetries of the permutohedron.

    #. Make a function out of the previous example, and
       explore the Cayley graphs of all rank 2 and 3 Weyl groups.

    #. Draw the root poset for type `B_2` and `B_3`

    #. Draw the root poset for type `E_8` to recover the picture from
       :wikipedia:`File:E8_3D.png`

Similarly, we display a crystal graph by positioning each element
according to its weight::

    sage: C = CrystalOfTableaux(["A",2], shape=[4,2])
    sage: L = C.weight_lattice_realization()
    sage: plot_options = L.plot_parse_options()

    sage: g = C.digraph()
    sage: positions = {x: plot_options.projection(x.weight()) for x in C}
    sage: p = L.plot()
    sage: p += g.plot(pos = positions,
    ...               color_by_label=plot_options.color, vertex_size=0)
    sage: p.axes(False)
    sage: p.show(figsize=15)

.. NOTE::

    In the above picture, many pairs of tableaux have the
    same weight and are thus superposed (look for example
    near the center). Some more layout logic would be
    needed to separate those nodes properly, but the
    foundations are laid firmly and uniformly accross all
    types of root systems for writing such extensions.

Here is an analogue picture in 3D::

    sage: C = CrystalOfTableaux(["A",3], shape=[3,2,1])
    sage: L = C.weight_lattice_realization()
    sage: plot_options = L.plot_parse_options()
    sage: g = C.digraph()
    sage: positions = {x:plot_options.projection(x.weight()) for x in C}
    sage: p = L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, fundamental_weights=False)
    sage: p += g.plot3d(pos3d = positions, vertex_labels=True,
    ...                 color_by_label=plot_options.color, edge_labels=True)
    sage: p


.. TOPIC:: Exercise

    Explore the previous picture and notice how the edges
    of the crystal graph are parallel to the simple roots.

        r"""
        Return the cone generated by the given rays and lines.

        INPUT:

        - ``rays``, ``lines`` -- lists of elements of the root lattice
          realization (default: ``[]``)

        - ``color`` -- a color (default: ``"black"``)

        - ``alpha`` -- a number in the interval `[0, 1]` (default: `1`)
          the desired transparency

        - ``label`` -- an object to be used as for this cone.
          The label itself will be constructed by calling
          :func:`~sage.misc.latex.latex` or :func:`repr` on the
          object depending on the graphics backend.

        - ``draw_degenerate`` -- a boolean (default: ``True``)
          whether to draw cones with a degenerate intersection with
          the bounding box

        - ``as_polyhedron`` -- a boolean (default: ``False``)
          whether to return the result as a polyhedron, without
          clipping it to the bounding box, and without making a plot
          out of it (for testing purposes)

        OUTPUT:

        A graphic object, a polyhedron, or ``0``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2]).root_lattice()
            sage: options = L.plot_parse_options()
            sage: alpha = L.simple_roots()

            A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 1 ray, 1 line

        An empty result, being outside of the bounding box::

            sage: options.cone(rays=[alpha[1]], lines=[alpha[2]], color='green', label=2)
            0

        Test that the options are properly passed down::

            sage: L = RootSystem(["A",2]).root_lattice()
            sage: options = L.plot_parse_options()
            sage: p = options.cone(rays=[alpha[1]+alpha[2]], color='green', label=2, thickness=4, alpha=.5)
            sage: list(p)
            [Line defined by 2 points, Text '$2$' at the point (3.15,3.15)]
            sage: sorted(p[0].options().items())

             ('legend_label', None), ('rgbcolor', 'green'), ('thickness', 4),
             ('zorder', 1)]

        This method is tested indirectly but extensively by the
        various plot methods of root lattice realizations.

def barycentric_projection_matrix(n, angle=0):
    r"""
    Returns a family of `n+1` vectors evenly spaced in a real vector space of dimension `n`

    Those vectors are of norm `1`, the scalar product between any two
    vector is `1/n`, thus the distance between two tips is constant.

    The family is built recursively and uniquely determined by the
    following property: the last vector is `(0,\dots,0,-1)`, and the
    projection of the first `n` vectors in dimension `n-1`, after
    appropriate rescaling to norm `1`, retrieves the family for `n-1`.

    OUTPUT:

    A matrix with `n+1` columns of height `n` with rational or
    symbolic coefficients.

    EXAMPLES:

    One vector in dimension `0`::

        sage: from sage.combinat.root_system.root_lattice_realizations import barycentric_projection_matrix
        sage: m = barycentric_projection_matrix(0); m
        []
        sage: matrix(QQ,0,1).nrows()
        0
        sage: matrix(QQ,0,1).ncols()
        1

    Two vectors in dimension 1::

        sage: barycentric_projection_matrix(1)
        [ 1 -1]

    Three vectors in dimension 2::

        sage: barycentric_projection_matrix(2)
        [ 1/2*sqrt(3) -1/2*sqrt(3)            0]
        [         1/2          1/2           -1]

    Four vectors in dimension 3::

        sage: m = barycentric_projection_matrix(3); m
        [ 1/3*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) -1/3*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)                    0                    0]
        [         1/3*sqrt(2)          1/3*sqrt(2)         -2/3*sqrt(2)                    0]
        [                 1/3                  1/3                  1/3                   -1]

    The columns give four vectors that sum up to zero::

        sage: sum(m.columns())
        (0, 0, 0)

    and have regular mutual angles::

        sage: m.transpose()*m
        [   1 -1/3 -1/3 -1/3]
        [-1/3    1 -1/3 -1/3]
        [-1/3 -1/3    1 -1/3]
        [-1/3 -1/3 -1/3    1]

    Here is a plot of them::

        sage: sum(arrow((0,0,0),x) for x in m.columns())

    For 2D drawings of root systems, it is desirable to rotate the
    result to match with the usual conventions::

        sage: barycentric_projection_matrix(2, angle=2*pi/3)
        [         1/2           -1          1/2]
