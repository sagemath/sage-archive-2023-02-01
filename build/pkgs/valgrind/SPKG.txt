== Description ==

This is an optional spkg. It supports Linux on x86, x86-64, ppc, ppc64 and ARM
as well as Darwin (Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6) on x86 and x86-64.

Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools.
There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management
and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use
Valgrind to build new tools.

The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality tools:
a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache and
branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and branch-prediction
profiler, and a heap profiler. It also includes three experimental tools: a
heap/stack/global array overrun detector, a second heap profiler that examines
how heap blocks are used, and a SimPoint basic block vector generator. It runs
on the following platforms: X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,
PPC64/Linux, S390X/Linux, ARM/Android (2.3.x), X86/Darwin and AMD64/Darwin
(Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7).
