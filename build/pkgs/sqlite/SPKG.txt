=== sqlite-3.7.17.p1 (R. Andrew Ohana, 11 November 2013) ===
 * #15433: don't build sqlite on OS X 10.9, as it can cause issues
   for the system libraries that link against Apple's custom
   version of sqlite

=== sqlite-3.7.17 (Jeroen Demeyer, 24 May 2013) ===
 * #14629: upgrade to version 3.7.17
 * Use standard template for SPKG.txt and spkg-install, use $MAKE instead of make
 * Remove Fortran and C++ stuff from spkg-install
 * Compile with -DSQLITE_WITHOUT_ZONEMALLOC on OS X <= 10.4

=== sqlite-3.7.5.p1 (William Stein, 10 May 2012) ===
 * #12937: sqlite sometimes picks up the wrong libraries (e.g., readline) since we forgot to set LDFLAGS.  Thus, set LDFLAGS.

=== sqlite-3.7.5.p0 (Simon King, 10th December 2011) ===
 * #12131: Use --libdir, to make this package work on openSUSE

=== sqlite-3.7.5 (David Kirkby, 6th April 2011) ===
 * Updated to the latest upstream release.
   http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3070500.tar.gz

=== sqlite-3.6.22  (David Kirkby, March 1st 2010) ===
 * #8408  Updated to 3.6.22, which is the latest release
   http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3.6.22.tar.gz
   This solves the following doctest failures on Solaris
   #8397, #8398, #8399, #8400 and #8401.
   This means ALL doctests pass on Solaris now.
 * Edited spkg-install so that the only value checked for SAGE64 was "yes"
   and not "yes" and "1", as an early install script ensure it can only be set
   to "yes", "no" or unset. Anything else is invalid, so there is no need to check
   for it.

=== sqlite-3.6.19.p0 (Mike Hansen, October 26th, 2009) ===
 * Updated to 3.6.19 with http://sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3.6.19.tar.gz.

=== sqlite-3.6.19.p0 (Mike Hansen, October 26th, 2009) ===
 * Updated to 3.6.19 with http://sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3.6.19.tar.gz.

=== sqlite-3.6.17.p0 (Dan Drake, October 25th, 2009) ===
 * Remove obsolete Makefile.in "patch" for Cygwin, since the new
   sqlite source uses autoconf. Remove special Cygwin bits from
   spkg-install; we don't need the client on Cygwin, but we install it
   anyway.

=== sqlite-3.6.17 (David Kirkby, August 16th, 2009) ===
 * Update to the latest upstream source. This compiles without
   any issues on the Sun Studio 12 update 1. Previously
   sqlite needed to be hacked to even build with gcc on
   Solaris.
 * Remove Solaris specific hacks previously added, as they
   are no longer needed.
 * Added CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I $SAGE_LOCAL/include"
   and exported that, as it failed to find the header files
   otherwise.
 * Removed the without-tcl option, as this is no longer an option
   to the configure script on sqlite. It appears to work without
   tcl.
 * Changed the code to build with 64-bit to work on any platform, not
   just Darwin as before. Sets flags for 64-bit whenever SAGE64 is set to
   'yes' or '1'.
 * Prints a few messages showing the flags used for compilation.
 * Adds 'set -e' where appropiate and removes it with 'set +e' where
   appropiate. This should catch more errors.
 * Adds debugging information by default, but it can be removed by setting
   SAGE_DEBUG to 'no' or '0'

=== sqlite-3.5.3.p4 (David Kirkby, June 13th, 2009) ===
 * Fixed a bug that prevented sqlite building on the Sun T5240
 t2.math.washington.edu running Solaris 10 update 4 with gcc version
 4.4.0.

 Linking libpthread before libc caused the problem. Changing the order
 of linking avoided it, but is not easy to do, as the order is
 determined by libtool. However, libpthread is not necessary on Solaris
 10. There is *probably* a libtool bug that is the real cause. The bug
 fix is implemented by striping libpthread out of the Makefile with sed.

 Thanks are due to Nicolas Williams (Nicolas.Williams@sun.com) who made
 me aware libpthread was not necessary, as its functionality was moved
 to libc in Solaris 10, with libpthread only provided for backwards
 compatibility.

=== sqlite-3.5.3.p3 (Michael Abshoff, May 19th, 2008) ===
 * add 64 bit OSX build support

=== sqlite-3.5.3.p2 (William Stein, May 16th, 2008) ===
 * Fix Makefile so it works on Cygwin (simply disable building sqlite client)
 * Change spkg-install to use bash
