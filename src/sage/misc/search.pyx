"""
Searching a sorted list

This is like the ``bisect`` library module, but also returns whether
or not the element is in the list, which saves having to do an
extra comparison. Also, the function names make more sense.

    """
    Return (True,i) where i is such that v[i] == x if there is such an i,
    or (False,j) otherwise, where j is the position where x should be inserted
    so that v remains sorted.

    INPUT:

    - v -- a list, which is assumed sorted

    - x -- Python object

    OUTPUT:

    bool, int

    This is implemented using the built-in ``bisect`` module.

        sage: search([1,4,6,7,8], 6)

        sage: search([1,4,6,7,8], 5)
