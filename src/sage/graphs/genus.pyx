Genus

This file contains a moderately-optimized implementation to compute the
genus of simple connected graph.  It runs about a thousand times faster
than the previous version in Sage, not including asymptotic improvements.

The algorithm works by enumerating combinatorial embeddings of a graph,
and computing the genus of these via the Euler characteristic.  We view
a combinatorial embedding of a graph as a pair of permutations `v,e`
which act on a set `B` of `2|E(G)|` "darts".  The permutation `e` is an
involution, and its orbits correspond to edges in the graph.  Similarly,
The orbits of `v` correspond to the vertices of the graph, and those of
`f = ve` correspond to faces of the embedded graph.

The requirement that the group `<v,e>` acts transitively on `B` is
equivalent to the graph being connected.  We can compute the genus of a
graph by

    `2 - 2g = V - E + F`

where `E`, `V`, and `F` denote the number of orbits of `e`, `v`, and
`f` respectively.

We make several optimizations to the naive algorithm, which are
described throughout the file.

    r"""

    A class which computes the genus of a DenseGraph through an
    extremely slow but relatively optimized algorithm.  This is
    "only" exponential for graphs of bounded degree, and feels
    pretty snappy for 3-regular graphs.  The generic runtime is

      `|V(G)| \prod_{v \in V(G)} (deg(v)-1)!`

    which is `2^{|V(G)|}` for 3-regular graphs, and can achieve
    `n(n-1)!^{n}` for the complete graph on `n` vertices.  We can
    handily compute the genus of `K_6` in milliseconds on modern
    hardware, but `K_7` may take a few days.  Don't bother with
    `K_8`, or any graph with more than one vertex of degree
    10 or worse, unless you can find an a priori lower bound on
    the genus and expect the graph to have that genus.

        This is where the real work happens.  Once cycles
        have been counted for the initial face_map, we
        make small local changes, and look at their effect
        on the number of cycles.

        Consider a vertex whose embedding is given by the
        cycle

        `self.vertex_darts[v] = [..., v0, v1, v2, ... ]`.

        which implies that the vertex map has the cycle

        `... -> v0 -> v1 -> v2 -> ... `

        and say we'd like to exchange a1 and a2.  Then,
        we'll change the vertex map to

        `... -> v0 -> v2 -> v1 -> ...`

        and when this happens, we change the face map orbit
        of `e0 = e(av)`, `e1 = e(v1)`, and `e2 = e(v2)`,
        where `e` denotes the edge map.

        In fact, the only orbits that can change are those
        of `e0`, `e1`, and `e2`. Thus, to determine the
        effect of the flip on the cycle structure, we need
        only consider these orbits.

        We find that the set of possibilities for a flip
        to change the number of orbits among these three
        elements is very small.  In particular,

           * If the three elements belong to distinct orbits,
             a flip joins them into a single orbit.

           * If the three elements are among exactly two
             orbits, a flip does not change that fact
             (though it does break the paired elements and
             make a new pair, all we care about is the
             number of cycles)

           * If all three elements are in the same orbit,
             a flip either disconnects them into three
             distinct orbits, or maintains status quo.

             To differentiate these situations, we need only
             look at the order of `v0`, `v1`, and `v2` under
             the orbit. If `e0 -> ... -> e2 -> ... -> e1`
             before the flip, the cycle breaks into three.
             Otherwise, the number of cycles stays the same.
