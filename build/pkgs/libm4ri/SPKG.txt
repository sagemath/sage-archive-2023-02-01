== Releases/Changelog ==

=== libm4ri-20100721 (Martin Albrecht, July 21th 2010) ===
 * Including M4RIE, an extension to M4RI for small extensions of GF(2).

=== libm4ri-20100701.p1 (Leif Leonhardy, July 15th 2010) ===
 * Committed Martin Albrecht's changes of July 13th (minor fixes, see #9475).
 * SPKG.txt:
   - Added "License" and "Special Update/Build Instructions" sections,
     fixed some typos, some additions.
 * spkg-install:
   - Fixed old typo (CLFAGS), fixed syntax error due to missing spaces that
     prevented SAGE_FAT_BINARY working.
   - Renamed $SSE2_SUPPORT to $DISABLE_SSE2.
   - Removed $SAGE_LOCAL/include from preprocessor search path since M4RI
     doesn't depend on any Sage package (similarly for library search path).
   - Removed redundant --includedir=... from configure.
   - Some restructuring.
 * spkg-check:
   - Replaced "make" by "$MAKE".
   - *Append* "-m64" to $CFLAGS rather than overwrite them if $SAGE64 is "yes".
 * Removed extra baggage (see "Special Update/Build Instructions" above).
 * (Note: There was no official p0. The above changes are all #9475.)

=== libm4ri-20100701 (Martin Albrecht, July 11th, 2010) ===
 * new upstream release
   + refactoring (function names now match what the function is doing)
   + heuristic algorithm choice for RREF
   + OpenMP tuning and fixes
   + new option to suppress SSE2 instructions
 * respecting SAGE_FAT_BINARY (cf. #9381)
 * adding spkg-check (cf. #9281)

=== libm4ri-20091119 (Martin Albrecht, November 19th, 2009) ===
 * portability improvements in configure.ac, cf. http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7375#comment:6

=== libm4ri-20091101 (Martin Albrecht, November 1st, 2009) ===
 * new upstream release
   + switched to LQUP instead of PLUQ for better performance
   + because of this and other improvements much better handling of sparse-ish matrices
   + overall better performance for elimination
   + better performance for mzd_transpose
   + dropped the check for the numer of CPUs from configure which was unused and not cross platform
   + optional tuning code to calculate cache sizes (not enabled by default)
   + some refactoring
   + mzd_row_add_offset() fixed a segfault
