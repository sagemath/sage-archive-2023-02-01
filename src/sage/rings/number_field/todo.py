[ ] The following should get implemented:

    sage: K.<a> = NumberField([x^2 + 2, x^2 + 3]); K
    Number Field in a0 with defining polynomial x^2 + 3 over its base field
    sage: I = K.factor_integer(14); I

    NotImplementedError

[ ] Better support for relative extensions.

[ ] Much faster basic arithmetic based on FLINT.

[ ] Orders

[ ] Write relative ideals.
