Sequences

A mutable sequence of elements with a common guaranteed category,
which can be set immutable.

Sequence derives from list, so has all the functionality of lists and
can be used wherever lists are used.  When a sequence is created
without explicitly given the common universe of the elements, the
constructor coerces the first and second element to some
*canonical* common parent, if possible, then the second and
third, etc.  If this is possible, it then coerces everything into the
canonical parent at the end.  (Note that canonical coercion is very
restrictive.)  The sequence then has a function ``universe()``
which returns either the common canonical parent (if the coercion
succeeded), or the category of all objects (Objects()).  So if you
have a list `v` and type

    sage: v = [1, 2/3, 5]
    sage: w = Sequence(v)
    sage: w.universe()
    Rational Field

then since ``w.universe()`` is `\QQ`, you're guaranteed that all
elements of `w` are rationals::

    sage: v[0].parent()
    Integer Ring
    sage: w[0].parent()
    Rational Field

If you do assignment to `w` this property of being rationals is guaranteed
to be preserved.

    sage: w[0] = 2
    sage: w[0].parent()
    Rational Field
    sage: w[0] = 'hi'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: unable to convert hi to a rational

However, if you do ``w = Sequence(v)`` and the resulting universe
is ``Objects()``, the elements are not guaranteed to have any
special parent.  This is what should happen, e.g., with finite field
elements of different characteristics::

    sage: v = Sequence([GF(3)(1), GF(7)(1)])
    sage: v.universe()
    Category of objects

You can make a list immutable with ``v.freeze()``.  Assignment is
never again allowed on an immutable list.

Creation of a sequence involves making a copy of the input list, and
substantial coercions.  It can be greatly sped up by explicitly
specifying the universe of the sequence::

    sage: v = Sequence(range(10000), universe=ZZ)

TESTS::

    sage: v = Sequence([1..5])
    sage: loads(dumps(v)) == v
    True

def Sequence(x, universe=None, check=True, immutable=False, cr=False, cr_str=None, use_sage_types=False):
    """
    A mutable list of elements with a common guaranteed universe,
    which can be set immutable.

    A universe is either an object that supports coercion (e.g., a
    parent), or a category.

    INPUT:

    - ``x`` - a list or tuple instance

    - ``universe`` - (default: None) the universe of elements; if None
      determined using canonical coercions and the entire list of
      elements.  If list is empty, is category Objects() of all
      objects.

    - ``check`` -- (default: True) whether to coerce the elements of x
      into the universe

    - ``immutable`` - (default: True) whether or not this sequence is
      immutable

    - ``cr`` - (default: False) if True, then print a carriage return
      after each comma when printing this sequence.

    - ``cr_str`` - (default: False) if True, then print a carriage return
      after each comma when calling ``str()`` on this sequence.

    - ``use_sage_types`` -- (default: False) if True, coerce the
       built-in Python numerical types int, long, float, complex to the
       corresponding Sage types (this makes functions like vector()
       more flexible)

    OUTPUT:

    - a sequence

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: v = Sequence(range(10))
        sage: v.universe()
        <type 'int'>
        sage: v
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    We can request that the built-in Python numerical types be coerced
    to Sage objects::

        sage: v = Sequence(range(10), use_sage_types=True)
        sage: v.universe()
        Integer Ring
        sage: v
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    You can also use seq for "Sequence", which is identical to using
    Sequence::

        sage: v = seq([1,2,1/1]); v
        [1, 2, 1]
        sage: v.universe()
        Rational Field
        sage: v.parent()
        Category of sequences in Rational Field
        sage: v.parent()([3,4/3])
        [3, 4/3]


    Note that assignment coerces if possible,::

        sage: v = Sequence(range(10), ZZ)
        sage: a = QQ(5)
        sage: v[3] = a
        sage: parent(v[3])
        Integer Ring
        sage: parent(a)
        Rational Field
        sage: v[3] = 2/3
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer

    Sequences can be used absolutely anywhere lists or tuples can be used::

        sage: isinstance(v, list)
        True

    Sequence can be immutable, so entries can't be changed::

        sage: v = Sequence([1,2,3], immutable=True)
        sage: v.is_immutable()
        True
        sage: v[0] = 5
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: object is immutable; please change a copy instead.

    Only immutable sequences are hashable (unlike Python lists),
    though the hashing is potentially slow, since it first involves
    conversion of the sequence to a tuple, and returning the hash of
    that.::

        sage: v = Sequence(range(10), ZZ, immutable=True)
        sage: hash(v)
        1591723448             # 32-bit
        -4181190870548101704   # 64-bit


    If you really know what you are doing, you can circumvent the type
    checking (for an efficiency gain)::

        sage: list.__setitem__(v, int(1), 2/3)        # bad circumvention
        sage: v
        [0, 2/3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        sage: list.__setitem__(v, int(1), int(2))     # not so bad circumvention

    You can make a sequence with a new universe from an old sequence.::

        sage: w = Sequence(v, QQ)
        sage: w
        [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        sage: w.universe()
        Rational Field
        sage: w[1] = 2/3
        sage: w
        [0, 2/3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    Sequences themselves live in a category, the category of all sequences
    in the given universe.::

        sage: w.category()
        Category of sequences in Rational Field

    This is also the parent of any sequence::

        sage: w.parent()
        Category of sequences in Rational Field

    The default universe for any sequence, if no compatible parent structure
    can be found, is the universe of all Sage objects.

    This example illustrates how every element of a list is taken into account
    when constructing a sequence.::

        sage: v = Sequence([1,7,6,GF(5)(3)]); v
        [1, 2, 1, 3]
        sage: v.universe()
        Finite Field of size 5
        sage: v.parent()
