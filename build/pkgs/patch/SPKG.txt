== Description ==

'patch' takes a patch file containing a difference listing produced
by the 'diff' program and applies those differences to one
or more original files, producing patched versions.

The version of 'patch' included is the GNU one. Some of the 'diff' files
produced by GNU 'diff' are not acceptble to some versions of the 'patch'
command, such as the 'patch' command that comes with Solaris.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

In the event patches ever need to be made to this package, the method of
applying the patches should not rely on the 'patch' existing on the system.

Versions 2.6 and 2.6.1 seem to be broken on OS X 10.4 (and supposedly also
Solaris too). So do NOT update the package to those versions.

Version 2.6.1 had some self-tests, so assuming the OS X & Solaris bugs get
fixed at some point, a spkg-check file should be added.

== Changelog ==

=== patch-2.5.9 (David Kirkby, Jeroen Demeyer, 16th november 2010)  ===
 * Initial version.
