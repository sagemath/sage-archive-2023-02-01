A catalog of normal form games.

This allows us to construct common games directly::

    sage: g = game_theory.normal_form_games.PrisonersDilemma()
    sage: g
    Prisoners dilemma - Normal Form Game with the following utilities: ...

We can then immediately obtain the Nash equilibrium for this game::

    sage: g.obtain_nash()
    [[(0, 1), (0, 1)]]

When we test whether the game is actually the one in question, sometimes we will
build a dictionary to test it, since the printed representation can be
platform-dependent, like so::

    sage: d = {(0, 0): [-2, -2], (0, 1): [-5, 0], (1, 0): [0, -5], (1, 1): [-4, -4]}
    sage: g == d
    True

The docstrings give an interpretation of each game.

def PrisonersDilemma(R=-2, P=-4, S=-5, T=0):
    r"""
    Return a Prisoners dilemma game.

    Assume two thieves have been caught by the police
    and separated for questioning.
    If both thieves cooperate and do not divulge any information they will
    each get a short sentence.
    If one defects he/she is offered a deal while the other thief will get a
    long sentence.
    If they both defect they both get a medium length sentence.

    This can be modeled as a normal form game using the following two matrices
    [Webb]_:

    .. MATH::

        A = \begin{pmatrix}
            R&S\\
            T&P\\
            \end{pmatrix}


        B = \begin{pmatrix}
            R&T\\
            S&P\\
            \end{pmatrix}

    Where `T > R > P > S`.

    - `R` denotes the reward received for cooperating.
    - `S` denotes the 'sucker' utility.
    - `P` denotes the utility for punishing the other player.
    - `T` denotes the temptation payoff.

    An often used version [Webb]_ is the following:

    .. MATH::

        A = \begin{pmatrix}
            -2&-5\\
            0&-4\\
            \end{pmatrix}


        B = \begin{pmatrix}
            -2&0\\
            -5&-4\\
            \end{pmatrix}

    There is a single Nash equilibrium for this at which both thieves defect.
    This can be implemented in Sage using the following::

        sage: g = game_theory.normal_form_games.PrisonersDilemma()
        sage: g
        Prisoners dilemma - Normal Form Game with the following utilities: ...
        sage: d = {(0, 0): [-2, -2], (0, 1): [-5, 0], (1, 0): [0, -5],
        ....:      (1, 1): [-4, -4]}
        sage: g == d
        True
        sage: g.obtain_nash()
        [[(0, 1), (0, 1)]]

    Note that we can pass other values of R, P, S, T::

        sage: g = game_theory.normal_form_games.PrisonersDilemma(R=-1, P=-2, S=-3, T=0)
        sage: g
        Prisoners dilemma - Normal Form Game with the following utilities:...
        sage: d = {(0, 1): [-3, 0], (1, 0): [0, -3],
        ....:      (0, 0): [-1, -1], (1, 1): [-2, -2]}
        sage: g == d
        True
        sage: g.obtain_nash()
        [[(0, 1), (0, 1)]]

    If we pass values that fail the defining requirement: `T > R > P > S`
    we get an error message::

        sage: g = game_theory.normal_form_games.PrisonersDilemma(R=-1, P=-2, S=0, T=5)

    Return a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

    Rock-Paper-Scissors is a zero sum game usually played between two
    players where each player simultaneously forms one of three
    shapes with an outstretched hand.The game has only three possible outcomes
    other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another
    player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to
    one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose
    to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). If both players throw the
    same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break
    the tie.

    Rock-Paper-Scissors.
    It is a zero sum game usually played between two
    players where each player simultaneously forms one of three
    shapes with an outstretched hand. This game became popular
    after appearing on the television show 'Big Bang Theory'.

    - Paper covers Rock
    - Rock crushes Lizard
    - Lizard poisons Spock
    - Spock smashes Scissors
    - Scissors decapitates Lizard
    - Lizard eats Paper

    Return a Chicken game.

    Consider two drivers locked in a fierce battle for pride. They drive
    towards a cliff and the winner is declared as the last one to swerve.
    If neither player swerves they will both fall off the cliff.

    This can be modeled as a particular type of anti coordination game
    using the following two matrices:

    .. MATH::

        A = \begin{pmatrix}
            A&C\\

            \end{pmatrix}

    Where `A < B, D < C` and `a < c, d < b` but with the extra
    condition that `A > C` and `a > b`.

    Here are the numeric values used by default [Watson]_:

    .. MATH::

        A = \begin{pmatrix}
            0&-1\\

    There are three Nash equilibria:

        1. The second player swerving.
        2. The first player swerving.
        3. Both players swerving with 1 out of 10 times.

    This can be implemented in Sage using the following::

def TravellersDilemma(max_value=10):

    Return a Travellers dilemma game.

    An airline loses two suitcases belonging to two different travelers. Both
    suitcases happen to be identical and contain identical antiques. An
    airline manager tasked to settle the claims of both travelers explains
    that the airline is liable for a maximum of 10 per suitcase, and in order
    to determine an honest appraised value of the antiques the manager
    separates both travelers so they can't confer, and asks them to write down
    the amount of their value at no less than 2 and no larger than 10. He
    also tells them that if both write down the same number, he will treat
    that number as the true dollar value of both suitcases and reimburse both
    travelers that amount.

    However, if one writes down a smaller number than the other, this smaller
    number will be taken as the true dollar value, and both travelers will
    receive that amount along with a bonus/malus: 2 extra will be paid to the
    traveler who wrote down the lower value and a 2 deduction will be taken
    from the person who wrote down the higher amount. The challenge is: what
    strategy should both travelers follow to decide the value they should
    write down?

    This can be modeled as a normal form game using the following two matrices
