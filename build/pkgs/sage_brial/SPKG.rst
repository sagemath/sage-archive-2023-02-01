BRiAl
=====

Description
-----------

BRiAl is the successor to PolyBoRi.

The core of PolyBoRi is a C++ library, which provides high-level data
types for Boolean polynomials and monomials, exponent vectors, as well
as for the underlying polynomial rings and subsets of the powerset of
the Boolean variables. This SPKG is a (sage) python wrapper around the
functionality of the C++ library.
