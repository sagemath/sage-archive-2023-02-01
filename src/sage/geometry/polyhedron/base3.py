        An example of two polyhedra with isomorphic face lattices

        Return the binary matrix of vertex adjacencies.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: polytopes.simplex(4).vertex_adjacency_matrix()
            [0 1 1 1 1]
            [1 0 1 1 1]

            [1 1 1 0 1]
            [1 1 1 1 0]

        The rows and columns of the vertex adjacency matrix correspond
        to the :meth:`Vrepresentation` objects: vertices, rays, and
        lines. The `(i,j)` matrix entry equals `1` if the `i`-th and
        `j`-th V-representation object are adjacent.

        Two vertices are adjacent if they are the endpoints of an
        edge, that is, a one-dimensional face. For unbounded polyhedra
        this clearly needs to be generalized and we define two
        V-representation objects (see
        :mod:`sage.geometry.polyhedron.constructor`) to be adjacent if
        they together generate a one-face. There are three possible
        combinations:

        * Two vertices can bound a finite-length edge.

        * A vertex and a ray can generate a half-infinite edge
          starting at the vertex and with the direction given by the
          ray.

        * A vertex and a line can generate an infinite edge. The
          position of the vertex on the line is arbitrary in this
          case, only its transverse position matters. The direction of
          the edge is given by the line generator.

        For example, take the half-plane::

            sage: half_plane = Polyhedron(ieqs=[(0,1,0)])
            sage: half_plane.Hrepresentation()
            (An inequality (1, 0) x + 0 >= 0,)

        Its (non-unique) V-representation consists of a vertex, a ray,
        and a line. The only edge is spanned by the vertex and the
        line generator, so they are adjacent::

            sage: half_plane.Vrepresentation()
            (A line in the direction (0, 1), A ray in the direction (1, 0), A vertex at (0, 0))
            sage: half_plane.vertex_adjacency_matrix()
            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 0]
            [1 0 0]

        In one dimension higher, that is for a half-space in 3
        dimensions, there is no one-dimensional face. Hence nothing is
        adjacent::

            sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[(0,1,0,0)]).vertex_adjacency_matrix()
            [0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0]

        EXAMPLES:

        In a bounded polygon, every vertex has precisely two adjacent ones::

            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)])
            sage: for v in P.Vrep_generator():
            ....:     print("{} {}".format(P.adjacency_matrix().row(v.index()), v))
            (0, 1, 0, 1) A vertex at (0, 1)
            (1, 0, 1, 0) A vertex at (1, 0)
            (0, 1, 0, 1) A vertex at (3, 0)
            (1, 0, 1, 0) A vertex at (4, 1)

        If the V-representation of the polygon contains vertices and
        one ray, then each V-representation object is adjacent to two
        V-representation objects::

            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)],
            ....:                rays=[(0,1)])
            sage: for v in P.Vrep_generator():
            ....:       print("{} {}".format(P.adjacency_matrix().row(v.index()), v))
            (0, 1, 0, 0, 1) A ray in the direction (0, 1)
            (1, 0, 1, 0, 0) A vertex at (0, 1)
            (0, 1, 0, 1, 0) A vertex at (1, 0)
            (0, 0, 1, 0, 1) A vertex at (3, 0)
            (1, 0, 0, 1, 0) A vertex at (4, 1)

        If the V-representation of the polygon contains vertices and
        two distinct rays, then each vertex is adjacent to two
        V-representation objects (which can now be vertices or
        rays). The two rays are not adjacent to each other::

            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)],
            ....:                rays=[(0,1), (1,1)])
            sage: for v in P.Vrep_generator():
            ....:     print("{} {}".format(P.adjacency_matrix().row(v.index()), v))
            (0, 1, 0, 0, 0) A ray in the direction (0, 1)
            (1, 0, 1, 0, 0) A vertex at (0, 1)
            (0, 1, 0, 0, 1) A vertex at (1, 0)
            (0, 0, 0, 0, 1) A ray in the direction (1, 1)
            (0, 0, 1, 1, 0) A vertex at (3, 0)
