Convex rational polyhedral cones

This module was designed as a part of framework for toric varieties
(:mod:`~sage.schemes.toric.variety`,
:mod:`~sage.schemes.toric.fano_variety`). While the emphasis is on
strictly convex cones, non-strictly convex cones are supported as well. Work
with distinct lattices (in the sense of discrete subgroups spanning vector
spaces) is supported. The default lattice is :class:`ToricLattice
<sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>` `N` of the appropriate
dimension. The only case when you must specify lattice explicitly is creation
of a 0-dimensional cone, where dimension of the ambient space cannot be
guessed.

EXAMPLES:

Use :func:`Cone` to construct cones::

    sage: octant = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)])
    sage: halfspace = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,-1,0), (0,0,1)])
    sage: positive_xy = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0)])
    sage: four_rays = Cone([(1,1,1), (1,-1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,1)])

For all of the cones above we have provided primitive generating rays, but in
fact this is not necessary - a cone can be constructed from any collection of
rays (from the same space, of course). If there are non-primitive (or even
non-integral) rays, they will be replaced with primitive ones. If there are
extra rays, they will be discarded. Of course, this means that :func:`Cone`
has to do some work before actually constructing the cone and sometimes it is
not desirable, if you know for sure that your input is already "good". In this
case you can use options ``check=False`` to force :func:`Cone` to use
exactly the directions that you have specified and ``normalize=False`` to
force it to use exactly the rays that you have specified. However, it is
better not to use these possibilities without necessity, since cones are
assumed to be represented by a minimal set of primitive generating rays.
See :func:`Cone` for further documentation on construction.

Once you have a cone, you can perform numerous operations on it. The most
important ones are, probably, ray accessing methods::

    sage: rays = halfspace.rays()
    sage: rays
    N( 0,  0, 1),
    N( 0,  1, 0),
    N( 0, -1, 0),
    N( 1,  0, 0),
    N(-1,  0, 0)
    in 3-d lattice N
    sage: rays.set()
    frozenset({N(-1, 0, 0), N(0, -1, 0), N(0, 0, 1), N(0, 1, 0), N(1, 0, 0)})
    sage: rays.matrix()
    [ 0  0  1]
    [ 0  1  0]
    [ 0 -1  0]
    [ 1  0  0]
    [-1  0  0]
    sage: rays.column_matrix()
    [ 0  0  0  1 -1]
    [ 0  1 -1  0  0]
    [ 1  0  0  0  0]
    sage: rays(3)
    N(1, 0, 0)
    in 3-d lattice N
    sage: rays[3]
    N(1, 0, 0)
    sage: halfspace.ray(3)
    N(1, 0, 0)

The method :meth:`~IntegralRayCollection.rays` returns a
:class:`~sage.geometry.point_collection.PointCollection` with the
`i`-th element being the primitive integral generator of the `i`-th
ray. It is possible to convert this collection to a matrix with either
rows or columns corresponding to these generators. You may also change
the default
:meth:`~sage.geometry.point_collection.PointCollection.output_format`
of all point collections to be such a matrix.

If you want to do something with each ray of a cone, you can write ::

    sage: for ray in positive_xy: print ray
    N(1, 0, 0)
    N(0, 1, 0)

There are two dimensions associated to each cone - the dimension of the
subspace spanned by the cone and the dimension of the space where it lives::

    sage: positive_xy.dim()
    2
    sage: positive_xy.lattice_dim()
    3

You also may be interested in this dimension::

    sage: dim(positive_xy.linear_subspace())
    0
    sage: dim(halfspace.linear_subspace())
    2

Or, perhaps, all you care about is whether it is zero or not::

    sage: positive_xy.is_strictly_convex()
    True
    sage: halfspace.is_strictly_convex()
    False

You can also perform these checks::

    sage: positive_xy.is_simplicial()
    True
    sage: four_rays.is_simplicial()
    False
    sage: positive_xy.is_smooth()
    True

You can work with subcones that form faces of other cones::

    sage: face = four_rays.faces(dim=2)[0]
    sage: face
    2-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N
    sage: face.rays()
    N(-1, -1, 1),
    N(-1,  1, 1)
    in 3-d lattice N
    sage: face.ambient_ray_indices()
    (2, 3)
    sage: four_rays.rays(face.ambient_ray_indices())
    N(-1, -1, 1),
    N(-1,  1, 1)
    in 3-d lattice N

If you need to know inclusion relations between faces, you can use ::

    sage: L = four_rays.face_lattice()
    sage: map(len, L.level_sets())
    [1, 4, 4, 1]
    sage: face = L.level_sets()[2][0]
    sage: face.rays()
    N(1,  1, 1),
    N(1, -1, 1)
    in 3-d lattice N
    sage: L.hasse_diagram().neighbors_in(face)
    [1-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N,
     1-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N]

.. WARNING::

    The order of faces in level sets of
    the face lattice may differ from the order of faces returned by
    :meth:`~ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.faces`. While the first order is
    random, the latter one ensures that one-dimensional faces are listed in
    the same order as generating rays.

When all the functionality provided by cones is not enough, you may want to
check if you can do necessary things using polyhedra corresponding to cones::

    sage: four_rays.polyhedron()
    A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as
    the convex hull of 1 vertex and 4 rays

And of course you are always welcome to suggest new features that should be
added to cones!

def Cone(rays, lattice=None, check=True, normalize=True):
    r"""
    Construct a (not necessarily strictly) convex rational polyhedral cone.

    INPUT:

    - ``rays`` -- a list of rays. Each ray should be given as a list
      or a vector convertible to the rational extension of the given
      ``lattice``. May also be specified by a
      :class:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base` object;

    - ``lattice`` -- :class:`ToricLattice
      <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, `\ZZ^n`, or any
      other object that behaves like these. If not specified, an attempt will
      be made to determine an appropriate toric lattice automatically;

    - ``check`` -- by default the input data will be checked for
      correctness (e.g. that all rays have the same number of
      components) and generating rays will be constructed from
      ``rays``. If you know that the input is a minimal set of
      generators of a valid cone, you may significantly decrease
      construction time using ``check=False`` option;

    - ``normalize`` -- you can further speed up construction using
      ``normalize=False`` option. In this case ``rays`` must be a list of
      immutable primitive rays in ``lattice``. In general, you should not use
      this option, it is designed for code optimization and does not give as
      drastic improvement in speed as the previous one.

    OUTPUT:

    - convex rational polyhedral cone determined by ``rays``.

    EXAMPLES:

    Let's define a cone corresponding to the first quadrant of the plane
    (note, you can even mix objects of different types to represent rays, as
    long as you let this function to perform all the checks and necessary
    conversions!)::

        sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), [0,1]])
        sage: quadrant
        2-d cone in 2-d lattice N
        sage: quadrant.rays()
        N(1, 0),
        N(0, 1)
        in 2-d lattice N

    If you give more rays than necessary, the extra ones will be discarded::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,1)]).rays()
        N(0, 1),
        N(1, 0)
        in 2-d lattice N

    However, this work is not done with ``check=False`` option, so use it
    carefully! ::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,1)], check=False).rays()
        N(1, 0),
        N(0, 1),
        N(1, 1),
        N(0, 1)
        in 2-d lattice N

    Even worse things can happen with ``normalize=False`` option::

        sage: Cone([(1,0), (0,1)], check=False, normalize=False)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'parent'

    You can construct different "not" cones: not full-dimensional, not
    strictly convex, not containing any rays::

        sage: one_dimensional_cone = Cone([(1,0)])
        sage: one_dimensional_cone.dim()
        1
        sage: half_plane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
        sage: half_plane.rays()
        N( 0, 1),
        N( 1, 0),
        N(-1, 0)
        in 2-d lattice N
        sage: half_plane.is_strictly_convex()
        False
        sage: origin = Cone([(0,0)])
        sage: origin.rays()
        Empty collection
        in 2-d lattice N
        sage: origin.dim()
        0
        sage: origin.lattice_dim()
        2

    You may construct the cone above without giving any rays, but in this case
    you must provide ``lattice`` explicitly::

        sage: origin = Cone([])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: lattice must be given explicitly if there are no rays!
        sage: origin = Cone([], lattice=ToricLattice(2))
        sage: origin.dim()
        0
        sage: origin.lattice_dim()
        2
        sage: origin.lattice()
        2-d lattice N

    Of course, you can also provide ``lattice`` in other cases::

        sage: L = ToricLattice(3, "L")
        sage: c1 = Cone([(1,0,0),(1,1,1)], lattice=L)
        sage: c1.rays()
        L(1, 0, 0),
        L(1, 1, 1)
        in 3-d lattice L

    Or you can construct cones from rays of a particular lattice::

        sage: ray1 = L(1,0,0)
        sage: ray2 = L(1,1,1)
        sage: c2 = Cone([ray1, ray2])
        sage: c2.rays()
        L(1, 0, 0),
        L(1, 1, 1)
        in 3-d lattice L
        sage: c1 == c2
        True

    When the cone in question is not strictly convex, the standard form for
    the "generating rays" of the linear subspace is "basis vectors and their
    negatives", as in the following example::

        sage: plane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1)])
        sage: plane.rays()
        N( 0,  1),
        N( 0, -1),
        N( 1,  0),
        N(-1,  0)
        in 2-d lattice N

    The cone can also be specified by a
    :class:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base`::

        sage: p = plane.polyhedron()
        sage: Cone(p)
        2-d cone in 2-d lattice N
        sage: Cone(p) == plane
        True

        sage: N = ToricLattice(2)
        sage: Nsub = N.span([ N(1,2) ])
        sage: Cone(Nsub.basis())

    Create a collection of integral rays.

    .. WARNING::

        No correctness check or normalization is performed on the input data.
        This class is designed for internal operations and you probably should
        not use it directly.

    This is a base class for :class:`convex rational polyhedral cones
    <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>` and :class:`fans
    <sage.geometry.fan.RationalPolyhedralFan>`.

    Ray collections are immutable, but they cache most of the returned values.

    INPUT:

    - ``rays`` -- list of immutable vectors in ``lattice``;

    - ``lattice`` -- :class:`ToricLattice
      <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, `\ZZ^n`, or any
      other object that behaves like these. If ``None``, it will be determined
      as :func:`parent` of the first ray. Of course, this cannot be done if
      there are no rays, so in this case you must give an appropriate
      ``lattice`` directly. Note that ``None`` is *not* the default value -
      you always *must* give this argument explicitly, even if it is ``None``.

    - collection of given integral rays.

        The codimension of a collection of rays (of a cone/fan) is the

        The codimension of the nonnegative orthant is zero, since the

        However, if we remove a ray so that the entire cone is contained
        within the `x`-`y` plane, then the resulting cone will have
        codimension one, because the `z`-axis is perpendicular to every
        element of the cone::

            True
            sage: K.codim()

        And if the cone is trivial in any space, then its codimension is
        equal to the dimension of the ambient space::

            sage: K = Cone([], lattice=ToricLattice(0))
            sage: K.lattice_dim()

        TESTS:

        The codimension of a cone should be an integer between zero and
        the dimension of the ambient space, inclusive::

    Create a convex rational polyhedral cone.

    .. WARNING::

        This class does not perform any checks of correctness of input nor
        does it convert input into the standard representation. Use
        :func:`Cone` to construct cones.

    Cones are immutable, but they cache most of the returned values.

    INPUT:

    The input can be either:

    - ``rays`` -- list of immutable primitive vectors in ``lattice``;

    - ``lattice`` -- :class:`ToricLattice
      <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, `\ZZ^n`, or any
      other object that behaves like these. If ``None``, it will be determined
      as :func:`parent` of the first ray. Of course, this cannot be done if
      there are no rays, so in this case you must give an appropriate
      ``lattice`` directly.

    or (these parameters must be given as keywords):

    - ``ambient`` -- ambient structure of this cone, a bigger :class:`cone
      <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>` or a :class:`fan
      <sage.geometry.fan.RationalPolyhedralFan>`, this cone *must be a face
      of* ``ambient``;

    - ``ambient_ray_indices`` -- increasing list or tuple of integers, indices
      of rays of ``ambient`` generating this cone.

    In both cases, the following keyword parameter may be specified in addition:

    - ``PPL`` -- either ``None`` (default) or a
      :class:`~sage.libs.ppl.C_Polyhedron` representing the cone. This
      serves only to cache the polyhedral data if you know it
      already. The polyhedron will be set immutable.

    OUTPUT:

    - convex rational polyhedral cone.

    .. NOTE::

        Every cone has its ambient structure. If it was not specified, it is
        this cone itself.

            1-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N

        Things are a little bit subtle with fans, as we illustrate below.

        First, we create a fan from two cones in the plane::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            1

        The second generating cone is adjacent to this one. Now we create the
        same fan, but embedded into the 3-dimensional space::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,0,0)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            1

        The result is as before, since we still have::

            sage: fan.dim()
            2

        Now we add another cone to make the fan 3-dimensional::

            sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2), (3,)],
            ...             rays=[(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,0,0), (0,0,1)])
            sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
            sage: len(cone.adjacent())
            0

        Since now ``cone`` has smaller dimension than ``fan``, it and its
        adjacent cones must be facets of a bigger one, but since ``cone``
        in this example is generating, it is not contained in any other.

        does not represent a valid cone of ``self``, ``ValueError`` exception
        is raised.

            This method is very quick if ``self`` is already the ambient
            structure of ``cone``, so you can use without extra checks and

        If we want to operate with this ray as a face of the cone, we need to
        embed it first::

            sage: e_ray = c.embed(ray)
            sage: e_ray
            1-d face of 3-d cone in 3-d lattice N

            in 3-d lattice N

        Return the face lattice of ``self``.

        This lattice will have the origin as the bottom (we do not include the
        empty set as a face) and this cone itself as the top.

        OUTPUT:

        - :class:`finite poset <sage.combinat.posets.posets.FinitePoset>` of
          :class:`cones <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Let's take a look at the face lattice of the first quadrant::

            sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
            sage: L = quadrant.face_lattice()
            sage: L
            Finite poset containing 4 elements with distinguished linear extension

        To see all faces arranged by dimension, you can do this::

            sage: for level in L.level_sets(): print level
            [0-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N]
            [1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,
             1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N]
            [2-d cone in 2-d lattice N]

        For a particular face you can look at its actual rays... ::

            sage: face = L.level_sets()[1][0]
            sage: face.rays()
            N(1, 0)
            in 2-d lattice N

        ... or you can see the index of the ray of the original cone that
        corresponds to the above one::

            sage: face.ambient_ray_indices()
            (0,)
            sage: quadrant.ray(0)
            N(1, 0)

        An alternative to extracting faces from the face lattice is to use
        :meth:`faces` method::

            sage: face is quadrant.faces(dim=1)[0]
            True

        The advantage of working with the face lattice directly is that you
        can (relatively easily) get faces that are related to the given one::

            sage: face = L.level_sets()[1][0]
            sage: D = L.hasse_diagram()
            sage: D.neighbors(face)
            [2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,
             0-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N]

        However, you can achieve some of this functionality using
        :meth:`facets`, :meth:`facet_of`, and :meth:`adjacent` methods::

            sage: face = quadrant.faces(1)[0]
            sage: face
            1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N
            sage: face.rays()
            N(1, 0)
            in 2-d lattice N
            sage: face.facets()
            (0-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,)
            sage: face.facet_of()
            (2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,)
            sage: face.adjacent()
            (1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,)
            sage: face.adjacent()[0].rays()
            N(0, 1)
            in 2-d lattice N

        Note that if ``cone`` is a face of ``supercone``, then the face
        lattice of ``cone`` consists of (appropriate) faces of ``supercone``::

            sage: supercone = Cone([(1,2,3,4), (5,6,7,8),
            ...                     (1,2,4,8), (1,3,9,7)])
            sage: supercone.face_lattice()
            Finite poset containing 16 elements with distinguished linear extension
            sage: supercone.face_lattice().top()
            4-d cone in 4-d lattice N
            sage: cone = supercone.facets()[0]
            sage: cone
            3-d face of 4-d cone in 4-d lattice N
            sage: cone.face_lattice()
            Finite poset containing 8 elements with distinguished linear extension
            sage: cone.face_lattice().bottom()
            0-d face of 4-d cone in 4-d lattice N
            sage: cone.face_lattice().top()
            3-d face of 4-d cone in 4-d lattice N
            sage: cone.face_lattice().top() == cone
            True

        TESTS::

            sage: C1 = Cone([(0,1)])
            sage: C2 = Cone([(0,1)])
            sage: C1 == C2
            True
            sage: C1 is C2
            False

        C1 and C2 are equal, but not identical. We currently want them
        to have non identical face lattices, even if the faces
        themselves are equal (see #10998)::

        Return faces of ``self`` of specified (co)dimension.

        INPUT:

        - ``dim`` -- integer, dimension of the requested faces;

        - ``codim`` -- integer, codimension of the requested faces.

        .. NOTE::

            You can specify at most one parameter. If you don't give any, then
            all faces will be returned.

        OUTPUT:

        - if either ``dim`` or ``codim`` is given, the output will be a
          :class:`tuple` of :class:`cones <ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>`;

        - if neither ``dim`` nor ``codim`` is given, the output will be the
          :class:`tuple` of tuples as above, giving faces of all existing
          dimensions. If you care about inclusion relations between faces,
          consider using :meth:`face_lattice` or :meth:`adjacent`,
          :meth:`facet_of`, and :meth:`facets`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Let's take a look at the faces of the first quadrant::

            sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
            sage: quadrant.faces()
            ((0-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,),
             (1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,
              1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N),
             (2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,))
            sage: quadrant.faces(dim=1)
            (1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,
             1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N)
            sage: face = quadrant.faces(dim=1)[0]

        Now you can look at the actual rays of this face... ::

            sage: face.rays()
            N(1, 0)
            in 2-d lattice N

        ... or you can see indices of the rays of the orginal cone that
        correspond to the above ray::

            sage: face.ambient_ray_indices()
            (0,)
            sage: quadrant.ray(0)
            N(1, 0)

        Note that it is OK to ask for faces of too small or high dimension::

            sage: quadrant.faces(-1)
            ()
            sage: quadrant.faces(3)
            ()

        In the case of non-strictly convex cones even faces of small
        non-negative dimension may be missing::

            sage: halfplane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
            sage: halfplane.faces(0)
            ()
            sage: halfplane.faces()
            ((1-d face of 2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,),
             (2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,))
            sage: plane = Cone([(1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1)])
            sage: plane.faces(1)
            ()
            sage: plane.faces()
            ((2-d cone in 2-d lattice N,),)

        TESTS:

        Now we check that "general" cones whose dimension is smaller than the
        dimension of the ambient space work as expected (see :trac:`9188`)::

            sage: c = Cone([(1,1,1,3),(1,-1,1,3),(-1,-1,1,3)])
            sage: c.faces()
            ((0-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,),
             (1-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,
              1-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,
              1-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N),
             (2-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,
              2-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,
              2-d face of 3-d cone in 4-d lattice N),
             (3-d cone in 4-d lattice N,))

        Return inward normals to facets of ``self``.

        .. NOTE::

            #. For a not full-dimensional cone facet normals will specify
               hyperplanes whose intersections with the space spanned by
               ``self`` give facets of ``self``.

            #. For a not strictly convex cone facet normals will be orthogonal
               to the linear subspace of ``self``, i.e. they always will be
               elements of the dual cone of ``self``.

            #. The order of normals is random, but consistent with
               :meth:`facets`.

        OUTPUT:

        - a :class:`~sage.geometry.point_collection.PointCollection`.

        If the ambient :meth:`~IntegralRayCollection.lattice` of ``self`` is a
        :class:`toric lattice
        <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, the facet nomals

        ``ZZ^n``) that does not have a ``dual()`` method, the facet normals
        will be returned as integral vectors.

        below is independent of TOPCOM, you don't have to use it::

            sage: PointConfiguration.set_engine('internal')

        We start with a simple case of a non-smooth 2-dimensional cone::

            N(1, 1),

        A non-simplicial cone works, too::

            sage: cone = Cone([(3,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)])
            sage: cone.semigroup_generators()

        GAP's toric package thinks this is challenging::

            sage: cone = Cone([[1,2,3,4],[0,1,0,7],[3,1,0,2],[0,0,1,0]]).dual()
            sage: len( cone.semigroup_generators() )
            2806

        The cone need not be strictly convex::

            sage: halfplane = Cone([(1,0),(2,1),(-1,0)])
            sage: halfplane.semigroup_generators()
            (N(0, 1), N(1, 0), N(-1, 0))
            sage: line = Cone([(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)])

            sage: wedge.semigroup_generators()

        Nor does it have to be full-dimensional (see
        http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11312)::

            sage: Cone([(1,1,0), (-1,1,0)]).semigroup_generators()

            N(-1, 1, 0)

        ALGORITHM:

        If the cone is not simplicial, it is first triangulated. Each
        simplicial subcone has the integral points of the spaned
        parallelotope as generators. This is the first step of the
        primal Normaliz algorithm, see [Normaliz]_. For each
        simplicial cone (of dimension `d`), the integral points of the
        open parallelotope

        .. math::

            par \langle x_1, \dots, x_d \rangle =
            \ZZ^n \cap
            \left\{
            q_1 x_1 + \cdots +q_d x_d
            :~
            0 \leq q_i < 1
            \right\}

        are then computed [BrunsKoch]_.

        Finally, the the union of the generators of all simplicial
        subcones is returned.

        Return the Hilbert basis of the cone.

        Given a strictly convex cone `C\subset \RR^d`, the Hilbert
        basis of `C` is the set of all irreducible elements in the
        semigroup `C\cap \ZZ^d`. It is the unique minimal generating
        set over `\ZZ` for the integral points `C\cap \ZZ^d`.

        If the cone `C` is not strictly convex, this method finds the
        (unique) minimial set of lattice points that need to be added
        to the defining rays of the cone to generate the whole
        semigroup `C\cap \ZZ^d`. But because the rays of the cone are
        not unique nor necessarily minimal in this case, neither is
        the returned generating set (consisting of the rays plus
        additional generators).

        See also :meth:`semigroup_generators` if you are not
        interested in a minimal set of generators.

        OUTPUT:

        - a
          :class:`~sage.geometry.point_collection.PointCollection`. The
          rays of ``self`` are the first ``self.nrays()`` entries.

        Compute a discrete complementarity set of this cone.

        A discrete complementarity set of a cone is the set of all

        set of the cone, and `s` is in some fixed generating set of its

        EXAMPLES:

        Pairs of standard basis elements form a discrete complementarity
        set for the nonnegative orthant::

            sage: K = Cone([(1,0),(0,1)])
            sage: K.discrete_complementarity_set()
            ((N(1, 0), M(0, 1)), (N(0, 1), M(1, 0)))

        If a cone consists of a single ray, then the second components
        of a discrete complementarity set for that cone should generate
        the orthogonal complement of the ray::

            sage: K = Cone([(1,0)])
            sage: K.discrete_complementarity_set()

             (N(1, 0, 0), M(0, 0, -1)))

        When a cone is the entire space, its dual is the trivial cone,
        so the only discrete complementarity set for it is empty::

            True
            sage: K.discrete_complementarity_set()

        Likewise for trivial cones, whose duals are the entire space::

            sage: K = Cone([], ToricLattice(0))
            sage: K.discrete_complementarity_set()

        TESTS:

        A discrete complementarity set for the dual can be obtained by
        switching components in a discrete complementarity set of the
        original cone::

        And by duality, every transformation is Lyapunov-like on the
        ambient space::

        However, in a trivial space, there are no non-trivial linear maps,
        so there can be no Lyapunov-like basis::

            sage: L = ToricLattice(0)
            sage: K = Cone([], lattice=L)
            sage: K.lyapunov_like_basis()

        The Lyapunov-like transformations on a cone and its dual are
        transposes of one another. However, there's no reason to expect
        that one basis will consist of transposes of the other::

    r"""
    Generate a random convex rational polyhedral cone.

    Lower and upper bounds may be provided for both the dimension of the
    ambient space and the number of generating rays of the cone. If a
    lower bound is left unspecified, it defaults to zero. Unspecified
    upper bounds will be chosen randomly, unless you set ``solid``, in
    which case they are chosen a little more wisely.

    You may specify the ambient ``lattice`` for the returned cone. In
    that case, the ``min_ambient_dim`` and ``max_ambient_dim``
    parameters are ignored.

    You may also request that the returned cone be strictly convex (or
    not). Likewise you may request that it be (non-)solid.

    .. WARNING::

        If you request a large number of rays in a low-dimensional
        space, you might be waiting for a while. For example, in three
        dimensions, it is possible to obtain an octagon raised up to height
        one (all z-coordinates equal to one). But in practice, we usually
        generate the entire three-dimensional space with six rays before we
        get to the eight rays needed for an octagon. We therefore have to
        throw the cone out and start over from scratch. This process repeats
        until we get lucky.

        We also refrain from "adjusting" the min/max parameters given to
        us when a (non-)strictly convex or (non-)solid cone is
        requested. This means that it may take a long time to generate
        such a cone if the parameters are chosen unwisely.

        For example, you may want to set ``min_rays`` close to
        ``min_ambient_dim`` if you desire a solid cone. Or, if you desire a
        non-strictly-convex cone, then they all contain at least two
        generating rays. So that might be a good candidate for
        ``min_rays``.

    INPUT:

    * ``lattice`` (default: random) -- A ``ToricLattice`` object in
      which the returned cone will live. By default a new lattice will
      be constructed with a randomly-chosen rank (subject to
      ``min_ambient_dim`` and ``max_ambient_dim``).

    * ``min_ambient_dim`` (default: zero) -- A nonnegative integer
      representing the minimum dimension of the ambient lattice.

    * ``max_ambient_dim`` (default: random) -- A nonnegative integer
      representing the maximum dimension of the ambient lattice.

    * ``min_rays`` (default: zero) -- A nonnegative integer representing
      the minimum number of generating rays of the cone.

    * ``max_rays`` (default: random) -- A nonnegative integer representing
      the maximum number of generating rays of the cone.

    * ``strictly_convex`` (default: random) -- Whether or not to make the
      returned cone strictly convex. Specify ``True`` for a strictly convex
      cone, ``False`` for a non-strictly-convex cone, or ``None`` if you
      don't care.

    * ``solid`` (defalt: random) -- Whether or not to make the returned
      cone solid. Specify ``True`` for a solid cone, ``False`` for a
      non-solid cone, or ``None`` if you don't care.

    OUTPUT:

    A new, randomly generated cone.

    A ``ValueError`` will be thrown under the following conditions:

    * Any of ``min_ambient_dim``, ``max_ambient_dim``, ``min_rays``, or
      ``max_rays`` are negative.

    * ``max_ambient_dim`` is less than ``min_ambient_dim``.

    * ``max_rays`` is less than ``min_rays``.

    * Both ``max_ambient_dim`` and ``lattice`` are specified.

    * ``min_rays`` is greater than four but ``max_ambient_dim`` is less than
      three.

    * ``min_rays`` is greater than four but ``lattice`` has dimension
      less than three.

    * ``min_rays`` is greater than two but ``max_ambient_dim`` is less than
      two.

    * ``min_rays`` is greater than two but ``lattice`` has dimension less
      than two.

    * ``min_rays`` is positive but ``max_ambient_dim`` is zero.

    * ``min_rays`` is positive but ``lattice`` has dimension zero.

    * A trivial lattice is supplied and a non-strictly-convex cone
      is requested.

    * A non-strictly-convex cone is requested but ``max_rays`` is less
      than two.

    * A solid cone is requested but ``max_rays`` is less than
      ``min_ambient_dim``.

    * A solid cone is requested but ``max_rays`` is less than the
      dimension of ``lattice``.

    * A non-solid cone is requested but ``max_ambient_dim`` is zero.

    * A non-solid cone is requested but ``lattice`` has dimension zero.

    * A non-solid cone is requested but ``min_rays`` is so large that
      it guarantees a solid cone.

    ALGORITHM:

    First, a lattice is determined from ``min_ambient_dim`` and
    ``max_ambient_dim`` (or from the supplied ``lattice``).

    Then, lattice elements are generated one at a time and added to a
    cone. This continues until either the cone meets the user's
    requirements, or the cone is equal to the entire space (at which
    point it is futile to generate more).

    We check whether or not the resulting cone meets the user's
    requirements; if it does, it is returned. If not, we throw it away
    and start over. This process repeats indefinitely until an
    appropriate cone is generated.

    EXAMPLES:

    Generate a trivial cone in a trivial space::

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: random_cone(max_ambient_dim=0, max_rays=0)
        0-d cone in 0-d lattice N

    We can predict the ambient dimension when
    ``min_ambient_dim == max_ambient_dim``::

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: K = random_cone(min_ambient_dim=4, max_ambient_dim=4)
        sage: K.lattice_dim()
        4

    Likewise for the number of rays when ``min_rays == max_rays``::

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: K = random_cone(min_rays=3, max_rays=3)
        sage: K.nrays()
        3

    If we specify a lattice, then the returned cone will live in it::

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: L = ToricLattice(5, "L")
        sage: K = random_cone(lattice=L)
        sage: K.lattice() is L
        True

    We can also request a strictly convex cone::

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: K = random_cone(max_ambient_dim=8, max_rays=10,
        ....:                 strictly_convex=True)
        sage: K.is_strictly_convex()
        True

    Or one that isn't strictly convex::

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: K = random_cone(min_ambient_dim=5, min_rays=2,
        ....:                 strictly_convex=False)
        sage: K.is_strictly_convex()
        False

    An example with all parameters set::

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: K = random_cone(min_ambient_dim=4, max_ambient_dim=7,
        ....:                 min_rays=2, max_rays=10,
        ....:                 strictly_convex=False, solid=True)
        sage: 4 <= K.lattice_dim() and K.lattice_dim() <= 7
        True
        sage: 2 <= K.nrays() and K.nrays() <= 10
        True
        sage: K.is_strictly_convex()
        False
        sage: K.is_solid()
        True

    TESTS:

    It's hard to test the output of a random process, but we can at
    least make sure that we get a cone back.

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: from sage.geometry.cone import is_Cone
        sage: K = random_cone(max_ambient_dim=6, max_rays=10)
        sage: is_Cone(K)
        True

    The upper/lower bounds are respected::

        sage: set_random_seed()
        sage: K = random_cone(min_ambient_dim=5, max_ambient_dim=8,
        ....:                 min_rays=3, max_rays=4)
        sage: 5 <= K.lattice_dim() and K.lattice_dim() <= 8
        True
        sage: 3 <= K.nrays() and K.nrays() <= 4
        True

    Ensure that an exception is raised when either lower bound is greater
    than its respective upper bound::
