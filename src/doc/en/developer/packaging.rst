==========================
Packaging Third-Party Code
==========================

One of the mottoes of the Sage project is to not reinvent the
wheel: If an algorithm is already implemented in a well-tested library
then consider incorporating that library into Sage. The current list
of available packages are the subdirectories of
``SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/``.

Not all of these packages are built by default, they are divided into
standard and optional ones. Standard packages are built by default and
have much more stringent quality requirements. In addition, there are
experimental spkgs (and some legacy optional spkgs) that are just
tarballs containing build scripts.


Inclusion Procedure for New and Updated Packages
================================================
Packages that are not part of Sage will first become optional or
experimental (the latter if they will not build on all supported
systems). After they have been in one of these two categories for
a year without problems they can be proposed to be included as
standard packages in Sage.

To propose a package for optional/experimental inclusion please
open a trac ticket with the respective ``Component:`` field set to
either ``packages:experimental`` or ``packages:optional``. The associated
code requirements are described in the following sections. In short,
packages consist of a link to the original tarball with additional
code under ``SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs``.

After the ticket was reviewed and included, experimental and optional
packages stay in that status for at least a year, after which they
can be proposed to be included as standard packages in Sage. For this
a trac ticket is opened with the ``Component:`` field set to
``packages:standard``. Note that the script in ``SAGE_ROOT/build/deps``
is called when building Sage so please include the build command
for your standard package there. Then make a proposal in the Google
Group ``sage-devel``.

Upgrading packages to new upstream versions or with additional
patches includes opening a ticket in the respective category too,
as described above.


Prerequisites for New Packages
==============================

For a package to become part of Sage's standard distribution, it
must meet the following requirements:

- **License**. For standard packages, the license must be compatible
  with the GNU General Public License, version 3. The Free Software
  Foundation maintains a long list of `licenses and comments about
  them <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html>`_.

- **Build Support**. The code must build on all the `fully supported
  platforms
  <http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms#Fully_supported>`_.

  A standard package should also work on all the platforms where Sage
  is `expected to work
  <http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms#Expected_to_work>`_ and
  on which Sage `almost works
  <http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms#Almost_works>`_ but
  since we don't fully support these platforms and often lack the
  resources to test on them, you are not expected to confirm your
  packages works on those platforms.

- **Quality**. The code should be "better" than any other available
  code (that passes the two above criteria), and the authors need to
  justify this. The comparison should be made to both Python and other
  software. Criteria in passing the quality test include:

  - Speed

  - Documentation

  - Usability

  - Absence of memory leaks

  - Maintainable

  - Portability

  - Reasonable build time, size, dependencies

- **Previously an optional package**. A new standard package must have
  spent some time as an optional package. Or have a good reason why
  this is not possible.

- **Refereeing**. The code must be refereed, as discussed in
  :ref:`chapter-sage-trac`.



.. _section-directory-structure:

Directory Structure
===================

Third-party packages in Sage consists of two parts: 

#. The tarball as it is distributed by the third party, or as close as
   possible. Valid reasons for modifying the tarball are deleting
   unnecessary files to keeep the download size manageable or
   regenerating auto-generated files if necessary. But the actual code
   must be unmodified. See also :ref:`section-spkg-src`.

#. The build scripts and associated files are in a subdirectory
   ``SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/package``, where you replace ``package``
   with a lower-case version of the upstream project name. 

As an example, let us consider a hypothetical FoO project. They
(upstream) distribute a tarball ``foo-1.3.tar.gz``. to package it in
Sage, we create a subdirectory containing the following::

    SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/foo
    |-- patches
    |   |-- bar.patch
    |   `-- baz.patch
    |-- checksums.ini
    |-- package-version.txt
    |-- spkg-check
    |-- spkg-install
    |-- spkg-src
    `-- SPKG.txt

We discuss the individual files in the following.


.. _section-spkg-install:

Install Script
--------------

The ``spkg-install`` file is a shell script installing the package,
with ``PACKAGE_NAME`` replaced by the the package name. In the best
case, the upstream project can simply be installed by the usual
configure / make / make install steps. In that case, the build script
would simply consist of::

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    cd src

    ./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error configuring PACKAGE_NAME."
        exit 1
    fi

    $MAKE
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error building PACKAGE_NAME."
        exit 1
    fi

    $MAKE -j1 install
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error installing PACKAGE_NAME."
        exit 1
    fi


Note that the top-level directory inside the tarball is renamed to
``src`` before calling the ``spkg-install`` script, so you can just
use ``cd src`` instead of ``cd foo-1.3``.

If there is any meaningful documentation included but not installed by
``make install``, then you can add something like the following to
install it::

    if [ "$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = yes ] ; then
        $MAKE doc
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error building PACKAGE_NAME docs."
            exit 1
        fi
        mkdir -p "$SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME"
        cp -R doc/* "$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME"
    fi
    



.. _section-spkg-check:

Self-Tests
----------

The ``spkg-check`` file is an optional, but highly recommended, script
to run self-tests of the package. It is run after building and
installing if the ``SAGE_CHECK`` environment variable is set, see the
Sage installation guide. Ideally, upstream has some sort of tests
suite that can be run with the standard ``make check`` target. In that
case, the ``spkg-check`` script would simply contain::

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    cd src
    $MAKE check


.. _section-spkg-versioning:

Package Versioning
------------------

The ``package-version.txt`` file containts just the version. So if
upstream is ``foo-1.3.tar.gz`` then the package version file would
only contain ``1.3``.

If the upstream package is taken from some revision other than a
stable version, you should use the date at which the revision is made,
e.g. the Singular package ``20090818`` is made with the revision as of
2009-08-18. 

If you made any changes to the upstream tarball (see
:ref:`section-directory-structure` for allowable changes) then you
should append a ``.p1`` to the version. If you make further changes,
increase the patch level as necessary. So the different versions would
be ``1.3``, ``1.3.p1``, ``1.3.p2``, ...


.. _section-spkg-SPKG-txt:

The SPKG.txt File
-----------------

The ``SPKG.txt`` file should follow this pattern::

     = PACKAGE_NAME =

     == Description ==

     What does the package do?

     == License ==

     What is the license? If non-standard, is it GPLv3+ compatible?

     == SPKG Maintainers ==

     * Mary Smith
     * Bill Jones
     * Leonhard Euler

     == Upstream Contact ==

     Provide information for upstream contact.

     == Dependencies ==

     Put a bulleted list of dependencies here:

     * python
     * readline

     == Special Update/Build Instructions ==

     List patches that need to be applied and what they do. If the
     tarball was modified by hand and not via a spkg-src script,
     describe what was changed.


with ``PACKAGE_NAME`` replaced by the the package name. Legacy
``SPKG.txt`` files have an additional changelog section, but this
information is now kept in the git repository.


.. _section-spkg-patching:

Patching Sources
----------------

Actual changes to the source code must be via patches, which should be
placed in the ``patches`` directory. GNU patch is distributed with
Sage, so you can rely on it being available. All patches must be
documented in ``SPKG.txt``, i.e. what they do, if they are platform
specific, if they should be pushed upstream, etc.

Patches to files in ``src/`` need to be applied in ``spkg-install``,
that is, if there are any patches then your ``spkg-install`` script
should contain a section like this::

    for patch in ../patches/*.patch; do
        [ -r "$patch" ] || continue  # Skip non-existing or non-readable patches
        patch -p1 <"$patch"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error applying '$patch'"
            exit 1
        fi
    done

which applies the patches to the sources.


.. _section-spkg-src:

Modified Tarballs
-----------------

The ``spkg-src`` file is optional and only to document how the
upstream tarball was changed. Ideally it is not modified, then there
would be no ``spkg-src`` file present either.

However, if you really must modify the upstream tarball then it is
recommended that you write a script, called ``spkg-src``, that makes
the changes. This not only serves as documentation but also makes it
easier to apply the same modifications to future versions.


Checksums
---------

The ``checksums.ini`` file contains checksums of the upstream
tarball. It is autogenerated, so you just have to place the upstream
tarball in the ``SAGE_ROOT/upstream/`` directory and run::

    [user@localhost]$ sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums


Testing
=======

If you have a new tarball that is not yet distributed with Sage, then
you have to manually place it in the ``SAGE_ROOT/upstream/`
directory. Then you can run the istallation via ``sage -f
package_name``. If your package contains any
:ref:`section-spkg-check`, run::

    [user@localhost]$ SAGE_CHECK=yes sage -f package_name


License Information
===================

If you are patching a standard Sage spkg, then you should make sure
that the license information for that package is up-to-date, both in
its ``SPKG.txt`` file and in the file ``SAGE_ROOT/COPYING.txt``.  For
example, if you are producing an spkg which upgrades the vanilla
source to a new version, check whether the license changed between
versions.
