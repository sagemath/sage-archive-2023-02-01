In many cases, documentation for modules and functions list the
authors.


Getting Started
---------------

This README.txt contains build instructions for Sage. If you downloaded  
a binary, you do not need to do anything; just execute:  

    ./sage

from the command line. If you downloaded the sources, please read below  
on how to build Sage and work around common issues.  

If you have questions or encounter problems, please do not hesitate  
to email the sage-support mailing list:  

   http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support


Supported Platforms
-------------------

Sage fully supports several Linux distributions, recent versions of  
Mac OS X, Windows (using virtualization), as well as a number of  
Solaris and OpenSolaris releases.  

There should be no serious bugs in an officially released version of  
Sage on any of the fully supported platforms, but any major issues with  
a particular release will be documented on an errata page:  

   http://wiki.sagemath.org/errata

Ports are in progress to some other, less common platforms. The list of  
supported platforms and their current statuses are given at the  
following web page:  

   http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms

If you are interested in helping port Sage to a new platform, please let  
us know at the sage-devel mailing list:  

   http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel


Quick Instructions to Build from Source
---------------------------------------

The following steps briefly outline the process of building Sage from  
source. More detailed instructions, including how to build faster on  
multicore machines, are contained later in this README and in the  
Installation Guide:  

   http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation

__1. Make sure you have the dependencies and 5 GB of free disk space.__

   >* __All Linux versions:__ gcc, make, m4, perl, ranlib, and tar.  
   
   >* __Fedora or RedHat systems:__ the perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker package.  
   (install these using your package manager)  

   >* __OS X:__ Xcode. Make sure you have installed the most recent version  
   of Xcode. With recent versions of OS X (OS X Lion or later), you  
   can install Xcode for free from the App Store. For pre-Lion  
   versions of OS X, you can download Xcode from  
   http://developer.apple.com/downloads/.  

   >* With OS X, you also need to install the "command line tools". When  
   using OS X Mavericks, after installing Xcode, run this command from  
   a terminal window:  

         xcode-select --install

   >* Then click "Install" in the pop-up window.

   >* When using OS X Mountain Lion or earlier, you need to install the  
   command line tools from Xcode: run Xcode; then from the File  
   menu, choose "Preferences", then the "Downloads" tab, and then  
   "Install" the Command Line Tools.  

   >* Other platforms: See detailed instructions below.

__2. Extract the tarball:__

         tar xvf sage-*.tar

__3. cd into the Sage directory and type make:__

         cd sage-*/
         make

   That's it! Everything is automatic and non-interactive. The build  
   should work fine on all fully supported platforms. If it does not, we  
   want to know!  


Environment Variables
---------------------

There are a lot of environment variables which control the install  
process of Sage, see:  

   http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables


Implementation
--------------

Sage has significant components written in the following languages:  
   > C/C++, Python, Cython, Lisp, and Fortran. Lisp (ECL), Python, and Cython  
   are built as part of Sage and a GNU Fortran (gfortran) binary is  
   included (OS X only), so you do not need them in order to build Sage.  


More Detailed Instructions to Build from Source
-----------------------------------------------

__1.__ Make sure you have about __5 GB of free disk space__.

__2. Install build dependencies.__

   >* __Linux:__ See quick instructions above.

   >* __OS X:__ Make sure you have XCode version >= 2.4, i.e. "gcc -v" should  
   output build >= 5363. If you don't, go to:  
      http://developer.apple.com/

   > sign up, and download the free XCode package. Only OS X >= 10.4 is  
   supported.

   >* __Solaris and OpenSolaris:__ Building Sage on these platforms is more  
   tricky than on Linux or OS X. For details on how to build Sage on  
   these platforms, see:  
      http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

   >* __Windows:__ Download and install VirtualBox, and then download the  
   Sage virtual appliance. For details, see:  
      http://wiki.sagemath.org/SageAppliance

   >* __NOTE:__ On some operating systems, it might be necessary to install  
   gas/as, gld/ld, gnm/nm. On most platforms, these are automatically  
   installed when you install the programs listed above.  

__3. Extract the Sage source tarball__ and cd into a directory with no  
   spaces in it. If you have a machine with 4 processors, say, type  
   the following to configure the build script to perform a parallel  
   compilation of Sage using 4 jobs:

         export MAKE="make -j4"

   >* (With 4 processors, you might also consider "-j5" or "-j6" --  
   building with more jobs than CPU cores can speed things up.)  
   You might in addition pass a "-l" flag to "make": this  
   sets a load limit, so for example if you execute  

         export MAKE="make -j4 -l5.5"

   > then "make" won't start more than one job at a time if the system  
   load average is above 5.5. See:  
   http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary  
   http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel.  

   > *If you want to run the test suite for each individual spkg as it is  
   installed, type:  

         export SAGE_CHECK="yes"

   > before starting the Sage build. This will run each test suite and  
   will raise an error if any failures occur. Python's test suite has  
   been disabled by default, because it causes failures on most  
   systems. To renable the Python testsuite, set the environment  
   variable SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES to "python".

   >* To start the build, type:  

         make

__4. Wait about 20 minutes to 14 days, depending on your computer__ (it took  
   about 2 weeks to build Sage on the T-Mobile G1 Android cell phone).  

__5. Type "./sage" to try it out.__  

__6. Optional__: Type "make ptest" to test all examples in the documentation  
   (over 200,000 lines of input!) -- this takes from 10 minutes to  
   several hours. Don't get too disturbed if there are 2 to 3 failures,  
   but always feel free to email the section of logs/ptest.log that  
   contains errors to the sage-support mailing list. If there are  
   numerous failures, there was a serious problem with your build.  

__7.__ The HTML version of the documentation is built during the compilation  
   process of Sage and resides in the directory:

         $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/sage/html/

   >* __Optional__: If you want to build the PDF version (requires LaTeX)  
   of the documentation, run:  

         make doc-pdf

__8. Optional__: It is recommended that you install the optional GAP
   database by typing:

         ./sage -i database_gap

   This will download the package and install it. While you're at it,
   you might install other optional packages of interest to you: type
   "./sage --optional" to get a list.

__9. Optional__: It is recommended that you have both LaTeX and the  
   ImageMagick tools (e.g. the "convert" command) installed since some  
   plotting functionality benefits from it.  

__10. Optional__: Read this if you are intending to run a Sage notebook  
    server for multiple users. For security (i.e., to run  
    "notebook(secure=True)") you want to access the server using the  
    HTTPS protocol. First, install OpenSSL and the OpenSSL development  
    headers on your system if they are not already installed. Then  
    install pyOpenSSL by building Sage and then typing  

         ./sage -i pyopenssl

   >* Note that this command requires internet access. Alternatively,  
   "make ssl" builds Sage and installs pyOpenSSL.


Problems
--------

* If you have problems building Sage, check the Sage Installation Guide,  
and also note the following. Each separate component of Sage is  
contained in an spkg; these are stored in spkg/standard/. As each one  
is built, a build log is stored in logs/pkgs/, so you can browse these  
to find error messages. If an spkg fails to build, the whole build  
process will stop soon after, so check the most recent log files  
first, or run  

         grep -li "^Error" logs/pkgs/*

from the top-level Sage directory to find log files with error  
messages in them.  Send (a small part of) the relevant log file to the  
sage-devel mailing list, making sure to include at least some of the  
error messages; probably someone there will have some helpful  
suggestions.  


Supported Compilers
-------------------

* Sage includes a GCC (_GNU Compiler Collection_) package. In order to  
build Sage, you need a C compiler which can build GCC and its  
prerequisites. gcc version 4.0.1 or later should probably work. On  
Solaris or OpenSolaris, building with the Sun compiler should also work.  

* The GCC package in Sage is not always installed. It is determined  
automatically whether it needs to be installed. You can override this  
by setting the environment variable **SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes** (to force  
installation of GCC) or **SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no** (to disable installation of  
GCC). If you don't want to install GCC, you need to have recent  
versions of gcc, g++ and gfortran; moreover, the versions must be equal.  

* There are some known problems with old assemblers, in particular when  
building the ECM package. You should ensure that your assembler  
understands all instructions for your processor. On Linux, this means  
you need a recent version of binutils; on OS X you need a recent version  
of XCode.

Relocation
----------

You *should* be able to move the sage-x.y.z/ directory anywhere you  
want. If you copy the sage script or make a symbolic link to it, you  
should modify the script to reflect this (as instructed at the top of  
the script). It is best if the path to Sage does not have any spaces in  
it.  

For a system-wide installation, as root you can move the sage-x.y.z/  
directory to a system-wide directory. Afterwards, you need to start up  
Sage as root at least once prior to using the system-wide Sage as a  
normal user. See the Installation Guide for further information on  
performing a system-wide installation:

   http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment

If you find anything that doesn't work correctly after you moved the  
directory, please email the sage-support mailing list.  


Redistribution
--------------

Your local Sage install is almost exactly the same as any 'developer'  
install. You can make changes to documentation, source, etc., and very  
easily package the complete results up for redistribution just like we  
do.  

1. To make your own source tarball of Sage, type:  

         sage --sdist

2. To make a binary distribution with your currently installed packages,  
   type:

         sage --bdist

3. To make a binary that will run on the widest range of target  
   machines, set the SAGE_FAT_BINARY environment variable to "yes"  
   before building Sage:  

         export SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes"
         make distclean && make
         ./sage --bdist

In all cases, the result is placed in the directory "$SAGE_ROOT/dist/".
