Distances/shortest paths between all pairs of vertices

This module implements a few functions that deal with the computation of
distances or shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

**Efficiency** : Because these functions involve listing many times the
(out)-neighborhoods of (di)-graphs, it is useful in terms of efficiency to build
a temporary copy of the graph in a data structure that makes it easy to compute
quickly. These functions also work on large volume of data, typically dense
matrices of size `n^2`, and are expected to return corresponding dictionaries of
size `n^2`, where the integers corresponding to the vertices have first been
converted to the vertices' labels. Sadly, this last translating operation turns
out to be the most time-consuming, and for this reason it is also nice to have a
Cython module, and version of these functions that return C arrays, in order to
avoid these operations when they are not necessary.

**Memory cost** : The methods implemented in the current module sometimes need large
amounts of memory to return their result. Storing the distances between all
pairs of vertices in a graph on `1500` vertices as a dictionary of dictionaries
takes around 200MB, while storing the same information as a C array requires
4MB.


The module's main function
--------------------------

The C function ``all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS`` actually does all the
computations, and all the others (except for ``Floyd_Warshall``) are just
wrapping it. This function begins with copying the graph in a data structure
that makes it fast to query the out-neighbors of a vertex, then starts one
Breadth First Search per vertex of the (di)graph.

**What can this function compute ?**

    - The matrix of predecessors.

      This matrix `P` has size `n^2`, and is such that vertex `P[u,v]` is a
      predecessor of `v` on a shortest `uv`-path. Hence, this matrix efficiently
      encodes the information of a shortest `uv`-path for any `u,v\in G` :
      indeed, to go from `u` to `v` you should first find a shortest
      `uP[u,v]`-path, then jump from `P[u,v]` to `v` as it is one of its
      outneighbors. Apply recursively and find out what the whole path is !.

    - The matrix of distances.

      This matrix has size `n^2` and associates to any `uv` the distance from
      `u` to `v`.

    - The vector of eccentricities.

      This vector of size `n` encodes for each vertex `v` the distance to vertex
      which is furthest from `v` in the graph. In particular, the diameter of
      the graph is the maximum of these values.

**What does it take as input ?**

    - ``gg`` a (Di)Graph.

    - ``unsigned short * predecessors`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n^2\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. Set to ``NULL`` if you do not
      want to compute the predecessors.

    - ``unsigned short * distances`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n^2\cdot\text{sizeof(unsigned short)}`. The computation of the distances
      is necessary for the algorithm, so this value can **not** be set to
      ``NULL``.

    - ``int * eccentricity`` -- a pointer toward an array of size
      `n\cdot\text{sizeof(int)}`. Set to ``NULL`` if you do not want to compute
      the eccentricity.

**Technical details**

    - The vertices are encoded as `1, ..., n` as they appear in the ordering of
      ``G.vertices()``.

    - Because this function works on matrices whose size is quadratic compared
      to the number of vertices when computing all distances or predecessors, it
      uses short variables to store the vertices' names instead of long ones to
      divide by 2 the size in memory. This means that only the
      diameter/eccentricities can be computed on a graph of more than 65536
      nodes. For information, the current version of the algorithm on a graph
      with `65536=2^{16}` nodes creates in memory `2` tables on `2^{32}` short
      elements (2bytes each), for a total of `2^{33}` bytes or `8` gigabytes. In
      order to support larger sizes, we would have to replace shorts by 32-bits
      int or 64-bits int, which would then require respectively 16GB or 32GB.

    - In the C version of these functions, infinite distances are represented
      with ``<unsigned short> -1 = 65535`` for ``unsigned short`` variables, and
      by ``INT32_MAX`` otherwise. These case happens when the input is a
      disconnected graph, or a non-strongly-connected digraph.

    - A memory error is raised when data structures allocation failed. This
      could happen with large graphs on computers with low memory space.

    .. WARNING::

        The function ``all_pairs_shortest_path_BFS`` has **no reason** to be
        called by the user, even though he would be writing his code in Cython
        and look for efficiency. This module contains wrappers for this function
        that feed it with the good parameters. As the function is inlined, using
        those wrappers actually saves time as it should avoid testing the
        parameters again and again in the main function's body.

    Tests if the graph is distance-regular

def distances_and_predecessors_all_pairs(G):
    r"""
    Returns the matrix of distances in G and the matrix of predecessors.

    Distances : the matrix `M` returned is of length `n^2`, and the distance
    between vertices `u` and `v` is `M[u,v]`. The integer corresponding to a
    vertex is its index in the list ``G.vertices()``.

    Predecessors : the matrix `P` returned has size `n^2`, and is such that
    vertex `P[u,v]` is a predecessor of `v` on a shortest `uv`-path. Hence, this
    matrix efficiently encodes the information of a shortest `uv`-path for any
    `u,v\in G` : indeed, to go from `u` to `v` you should first find a shortest
    `uP[u,v]`-path, then jump from `P[u,v]` to `v` as it is one of its
    outneighbors.

    The integer corresponding to a vertex is its index in the list
    ``G.vertices()``.

    Returns the diameter of `G`.

    This algorithm returns Infinity if the (di)graph is not connected. It can
    also quickly return a lower bound on the diameter using the ``2sweep`` and
    ``multi-sweep`` schemes.

    INPUT:

    - ``algorithm`` -- (default: 'iFUB') specifies the algorithm to use among:

      - ``'standard'`` -- Computes the diameter of the input (di)graph as the
        largest eccentricity of its vertices. This is the classical algorithm
        with time complexity in `O(nm)`.

      - ``'2sweep'`` -- Computes a lower bound on the diameter of an
        unweighted undirected graph using 2 BFS, as proposed in [MLH08]_.  It
        first selects a vertex `v` that is at largest distance from an initial
        vertex source using BFS. Then it performs a second BFS from `v`. The
        largest distance from `v` is returned as a lower bound on the diameter
        of `G`.  The time complexity of this algorithm is linear in the size of
        `G`.

      - ``'multi-sweep'`` -- Computes a lower bound on the diameter of an
        unweighted undirected graph using several iterations of the ``2sweep``
        algorithms [CGH+13]_. Roughly, it first uses ``2sweep`` to identify
        two vertices `u` and `v` that are far apart. Then it selects a vertex
        `w` that is at same distance from `u` and `v`.  This vertex `w` will
        serve as the new source for another iteration of the ``2sweep``
        algorithm that may improve the current lower bound on the diameter.
        This process is repeated as long as the lower bound on the diameter
        is improved.

      - ``'iFUB'`` -- The iFUB (iterative Fringe Upper Bound) algorithm,
        proposed in [CGI+10]_, computes the exact value of the diameter of an
        unweighted undirected graph. It is based on the following observation:

            The diameter of the graph is equal to the maximum eccentricity of
            a vertex. Let `v` be any vertex, and let `V` be partitionned into
            `A\cup B` where:

            .. MATH::

                d(v,a)<=i, \forall a \in A\\
                d(v,b)>=i, \forall b \in B

            As all vertices from `A` are at distance `\leq 2i` from each
            other, a vertex `a\in A` with eccentricity `ecc(a)>2i` is at
            distance `ecc(a)` from some vertex `b\in B`.

            Consequently, if we have already computed the maximum eccentricity
            `m` of all vertices in `B` and if `m>2i`, then we do not need to
            compute the eccentricity of the vertices in `A`.

        Starting from a vertex `v` obtained through a multi-sweep computation
        (which refines the 4sweep algorithm used in [CGH+13]_), we compute the
        diameter by computing the eccentricity of all vertices sorted
        decreasingly according to their distance to `v`, and stop as allowed
        by the remark above. The worst case time complexity of the iFUB
        algorithm is `O(nm)`, but it can be very fast in practice.

    - ``source`` -- (default: None) vertex from which to start the first BFS.
      If ``source==None``, an arbitrary vertex of the graph is chosen. Raise an
      error if the initial vertex is not in `G`.  This parameter is not used
      when ``algorithm=='standard'``.

def floyd_warshall(gg, paths = True, distances = False):
    r"""
    Computes the shortest path/distances between all pairs of vertices.

    For more information on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, see the `Wikipedia
    article on Floyd-Warshall
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm>`_.

    INPUT:

    - ``gg`` -- the graph on which to work.

    - ``paths`` (boolean) -- whether to return the dictionary of shortest
      paths. Set to ``True`` by default.

    - ``distances`` (boolean) -- whether to return the dictionary of
      distances. Set to ``False`` by default.

    OUTPUT:

        Depending on the input, this function return the dictionary of paths,
        the dictionary of distances, or a pair of dictionaries
        ``(distances, paths)`` where ``distance[u][v]`` denotes the distance of a
        shortest path from `u` to `v` and ``paths[u][v]`` denotes an inneighbor
        `w` of `v` such that `dist(u,v)= 1 + dist(u,w)`.

    .. WARNING::

        Because this function works on matrices whose size is quadratic compared
        to the number of vertices, it uses short variables instead of long ones
        to divide by 2 the size in memory. This means that the current
        implementation does not run on a graph of more than 65536 nodes (this
        can be easily changed if necessary, but would require much more
        memory. It may be worth writing two versions). For information, the
        current version of the algorithm on a graph with `65536=2^{16}` nodes
        creates in memory `2` tables on `2^{32}` short elements (2bytes each),
        for a total of `2^{34}` bytes or `16` gigabytes. Let us also remember
        that if the memory size is quadratic, the algorithm runs in cubic time.

    .. NOTE::

        When ``paths = False`` the algorithm saves roughly half of the memory as
        it does not have to maintain the matrix of predecessors. However,
        setting ``distances=False`` produces no such effect as the algorithm can
        not run without computing them. They will not be returned, but they will
        be stored while the method is running.

    EXAMPLES:

    Shortest paths in a small grid ::

        sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(2,2)
        sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import floyd_warshall
        sage: print floyd_warshall(g)
        {(0, 1): {(0, 1): None, (1, 0): (0, 0), (0, 0): (0, 1), (1, 1): (0, 1)},
        (1, 0): {(0, 1): (0, 0), (1, 0): None, (0, 0): (1, 0), (1, 1): (1, 0)},
        (0, 0): {(0, 1): (0, 0), (1, 0): (0, 0), (0, 0): None, (1, 1): (0, 1)},
        (1, 1): {(0, 1): (1, 1), (1, 0): (1, 1), (0, 0): (0, 1), (1, 1): None}}

    Checking the distances are correct ::

        sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(5,5)
        sage: dist,path = floyd_warshall(g, distances = True)
        sage: all( dist[u][v] == g.distance(u,v) for u in g for v in g )
        True

    Checking a random path is valid ::

        sage: u,v = g.random_vertex(), g.random_vertex()
        sage: p = [v]
        sage: while p[0] is not None:
        ...     p.insert(0,path[u][p[0]])
        sage: len(p) == dist[u][v] + 2
        True

    Distances for all pairs of vertices in a diamond::

        sage: g = graphs.DiamondGraph()
        sage: floyd_warshall(g, paths = False, distances = True)
        {0: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2},
         1: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1},
         2: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1},
         3: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0}}
