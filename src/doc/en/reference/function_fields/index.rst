Algebraic Function Fields
=========================

Sage allows basic computations with elements and ideals in orders of algebraic
function fields over arbitrary constant fields. Advanced computations, like
computing the genus or a basis of the Riemann-Roch space of a divisor, are
available for function fields over finite fields, number fields, and the
algebraic closure of `\QQ`.
