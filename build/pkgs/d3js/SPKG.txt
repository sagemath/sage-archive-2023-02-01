== Dependencies ==

None.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

Two kind of archives can be downloaded from d3.js website: one with all source
code and tests that weights 2,9M (both in zip and tar.gz formats) and one with
the final javascript scripts which weights 121K (zip format only). Since
testing requires node.js that is not shipped with Sage, we currenlty ship the
final js only. Hence we have to transform it from zip to tar.gz format.
Running sage-src should do all the repackaging job.
