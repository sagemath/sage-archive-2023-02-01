Knapsack Problems

This module implements a number of solutions to various knapsack problems,
otherwise known as linear integer programming problems. Solutions to the
following knapsack problems are implemented:

- Solving the subset sum problem for super-increasing sequences.
- General case using Linear Programming

Definition of Knapsack problems
-------------------------------

You have already had a knapsack problem, so you should know, but in case you do
not, a knapsack problem is what happens when you have hundred of items to put
into a bag which is too small, and you want to pack the most useful of them.

When you formally write it, here is your problem:

* Your bag can contain a weight of at most `W`.
* Each item `i` has a weight `w_i`.
* Each item `i` has a usefulness `u_i`.

You then want to maximize the total usefulness of the items you will store into
your bag, while keeping sure the weight of the bag will not go over `W`.

As a linear program, this problem can be represented this way (if you define
`b_i` as the binary variable indicating whether the item `i` is to be included
in your bag):

.. MATH::

    \mbox{Maximize: }\sum_i b_i u_i \\
    \mbox{Such that: }
    \sum_i b_i w_i \leq W \\
    \forall i, b_i \mbox{ binary variable} \\

(For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Knapsack_problem`)

Examples
--------

If your knapsack problem is composed of three items (weight, value)
defined by (1,2), (1.5,1), (0.5,3), and a bag of maximum weight 2,
you can easily solve it this way::

    sage: from sage.numerical.knapsack import knapsack
    sage: knapsack( [(1,2), (1.5,1), (0.5,3)], max=2)
    [5.0, [(1, 2), (0.500000000000000, 3)]]

Super-increasing sequences
--------------------------

We can test for whether or not a sequence is super-increasing::

    sage: from sage.numerical.knapsack import Superincreasing
    sage: L = [1, 2, 5, 21, 69, 189, 376, 919]
    sage: seq = Superincreasing(L)
    sage: seq
    Super-increasing sequence of length 8
    sage: seq.is_superincreasing()
    True
    sage: Superincreasing().is_superincreasing([1,3,5,7])
    False

Solving the subset sum problem for a super-increasing sequence
and target sum::

    sage: L = [1, 2, 5, 21, 69, 189, 376, 919]
    sage: Superincreasing(L).subset_sum(98)
    [69, 21, 5, 2, 1]

class Superincreasing(SageObject):
    r"""
    A class for super-increasing sequences.

    Let `L = (a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n)` be a non-empty sequence of
    non-negative integers. Then `L` is said to be super-increasing if
    each `a_i` is strictly greater than the sum of all previous values.
    That is, for each `a_i \in L` the sequence `L` must satisfy the property

    .. MATH::

        a_i > \sum_{k=1}^{i-1} a_k

    in order to be called a super-increasing sequence, where `|L| \geq 2`.
    If `L` has only one element, it is also defined to be a
    super-increasing sequence.

    If ``seq`` is ``None``, then construct an empty sequence. By
    definition, this empty sequence is not super-increasing.

        Solving the subset sum problem for a super-increasing sequence.

        Let `S = (s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots, s_n)` be a non-empty sequence of
        non-negative integers, and let `N \in \ZZ` be non-negative. The
        subset sum problem asks for a  subset `A \subseteq S` all of whose
        elements sum to `N`. This method specializes the subset sum problem
        to the case of super-increasing sequences. If a solution exists, then
        it is also a super-increasing sequence.

        .. NOTE::

            This method only solves the subset sum problem for
            super-increasing sequences. In general, solving the subset sum
            problem for an arbitrary sequence is known to be computationally
            hard.


        INPUT:

        - ``N`` -- a non-negative integer.


        OUTPUT:

        - A non-empty subset of ``self`` whose elements sum to ``N``. This
          subset is also a super-increasing sequence. If no such subset
          exists, then return the empty list.

    Solves the knapsack problem

    For more information on the knapsack problem, see the documentation of the
    :mod:`knapsack module <sage.numerical.knapsack>` or the
    :wikipedia:`Knapsack_problem`.

    INPUT:

    - ``seq`` -- Two different possible types:

      - A sequence of tuples ``(weight, value, something1, something2,
        ...)``. Note that only the first two coordinates (``weight`` and
        ``values``) will be taken into account. The rest (if any) will be
        ignored. This can be useful if you need to attach some information to
        the items.

      - A sequence of reals (a value of 1 is assumed).

    - ``binary`` -- When set to ``True``, an item can be taken 0 or 1 time.
      When set to ``False``, an item can be taken any amount of times (while
      staying integer and positive).

    - ``max`` -- Maximum admissible weight.

    - ``value_only`` -- When set to ``True``, only the maximum useful value is
      returned. When set to ``False``, both the maximum useful value and an
      assignment are returned.

    - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
      (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
      more information on MILP solvers and which default solver is used, see
      the method
      :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
      of the class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of verbosity. Set
      to 0 by default, which means quiet.

    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- parameter for use with MILP solvers over an
      inexact base ring; see :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

    OUTPUT:

    If ``value_only`` is set to ``True``, only the maximum useful value is
    returned. Else (the default), the function returns a pair ``[value,list]``,
    where ``list`` can be of two types according to the type of ``seq``:

    - The list of tuples `(w_i, u_i, ...)` occurring in the solution.

    - A list of reals where each real is repeated the number of times it is
      taken into the solution.

    EXAMPLES:

    If your knapsack problem is composed of three items ``(weight, value)``
    defined by ``(1,2), (1.5,1), (0.5,3)``, and a bag of maximum weight `2`, you
    can easily solve it this way::

        sage: from sage.numerical.knapsack import knapsack
        sage: knapsack( [(1,2), (1.5,1), (0.5,3)], max=2)
        [5.0, [(1, 2), (0.500000000000000, 3)]]

        sage: knapsack( [(1,2), (1.5,1), (0.5,3)], max=2, value_only=True)
        5.0

    Besides weight and value, you may attach any data to the items::

        sage: from sage.numerical.knapsack import knapsack
        sage: knapsack( [(1, 2, 'spam'), (0.5, 3, 'a', 'lot')])
        [3.0, [(0.500000000000000, 3, 'a', 'lot')]]

    In the case where all the values (usefulness) of the items are equal to one,
    you do not need embarrass yourself with the second values, and you can just
    type for items `(1,1), (1.5,1), (0.5,1)` the command::

        sage: from sage.numerical.knapsack import knapsack
        sage: knapsack([1,1.5,0.5], max=2, value_only=True)
        2.0
