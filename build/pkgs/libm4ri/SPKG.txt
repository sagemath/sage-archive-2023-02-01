 * new upstream release
   + refactoring (function names match what the function is doing now)
   + heuristic algorithm choice for RREF
   + OpenMP tuning and fixes
   + new option to supress SSE2 instruction

=== libm4ri-20091101 (Martin Albrecht, November 1st, 2009) ===
 * new upstream release
   + switched to LQUP instead of PLUQ for better performance
   + because of this and other improvements much better handling of sparse-ish matrices
   + overall better performance for elimination
   + better performance for mzd_transpose
   + dropped the check for the numer of CPUs from configure which was unused and not cross platform
   + optional tuning code to calculate cache sizes (not enabled by default)
   + some refactoring
   + mzd_row_add_offset() fixed a segfault
