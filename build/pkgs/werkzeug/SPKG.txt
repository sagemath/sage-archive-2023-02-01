== Description ==

The Swiss Army knife of Python web development

Werkzeug started as simple collection of various utilities for WSGI
applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility modules. It
includes a powerful debugger, full featured request and response objects, HTTP
utilities to handle entity tags, cache control headers, HTTP dates, cookie
handling, file uploads, a powerful URL routing system and a bunch of community
contributed addon modules.

Werkzeug is unicode aware and doesn't enforce a specific template engine,
database adapter or anything else. It doesnâ€™t even enforce a specific way of
handling requests and leaves all that up to the developer. It's most useful
for end user applications which should work on as many server environments as
possible (such as blogs, wikis, bulletin boards, etc.).
