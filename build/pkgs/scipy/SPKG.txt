== Description ==
SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
science, and engineering. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides
convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is
built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient
numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.
Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and
are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be
depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.

== Changelog ==

== scipy-0.8 (S. Reiterer, F. Bissey, D. Kirkby; 6th October 2010) ===
 * #9808 Upgrade to scipy 0.8.
 * Deleted outdated patches
 * spkg install changed by F. Bissey, because g95 makes trouble on OS X.
 * Exported FC, F77, F90 and F95 so SciPy does use the compiler
   we specify. Just setting FC was insufficient on a Sun with Fortran compilers
   in /usr/bin/f77 and /usr/bin/f90. The variable F95 was only set as a
   precautionary measure
 * Added "License information", "Upstream Contact", "Dependencies" and
   "Special Update/Build Instructions" section to SPKG.txt
 * Changed "maintainer" to "SPKG Maintainers" in SPKG.txt to be consistent with
   what is stated in the Sage Developers Guide.

=== scipy-0.7.1 (Jason Grout; 12 Nov 2009) ===
 * upgrade to scipy 0.7.1.  The optimize.py patch still needs to be applied in this version of scipy.

=== scipy-0.7.0 (Jason Grout; 27 May 2009) ===
 * upgrade to scipy 0.7.0
 * add an upstream change in patches/optimize.py.  In the next version of scipy, this patch should be deleted.

=== scipy-20071020-0.6.p4 (William Stein; July 11, 2008) ===
 * bump version to force recompile since we improved the numpy distutils.

=== scipy-20071020-0.6.p3 ===
 * add hg repo, add .hgignore, remove backup files

=== scipy-20071020-0.6.p2 ===
 * previous release
