        The scalar restriction of ``self`` to the ``newbase``.

        It is defined as follows.
        In each above three cases, we get a ring homorphism ``f``
        from a domain ``domain`` to the base of ``self``.
        The scalar restriction of ``self`` to ``newbase`` is the
        extension ``self._backend()/domain`` with defining morphism the
        compositum of ``f`` with the defining morphism of ``self``
