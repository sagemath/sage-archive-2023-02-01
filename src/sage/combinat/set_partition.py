class SetPartition(AbstractSetPartition,

    r"""
    A partition of a set.

    A set partition `p` of a set `S` is a partition of `S` into subsets
    called parts and represented as a set of sets. By extension, a set
    partition of a nonnegative integer `n` is the set partition of the
    integers from 1 to `n`. The number of set partitions of `n` is called
    the `n`-th Bell number.

    There is a natural integer partition associated with a set partition,
    namely the nonincreasing sequence of sizes of all its parts.

    There is a classical lattice associated with all set partitions of
    `n`. The infimum of two set partitions is the set partition obtained
    by intersecting all the parts of both set partitions. The supremum
    is obtained by transitive closure of the relation `i` related to `j`
    if and only if they are in the same part in at least one of the set
    partitions.

    We will use terminology from partitions, in particular the *length* of
    a set partition `A = \{A_1, \ldots, A_k\}` is the number of parts of `A`
    and is denoted by `|A| := k`. The *size* of `A` is the cardinality of `S`.
    We will also sometimes use the notation `[n] := \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}`.

    EXAMPLES:

    There are 5 set partitions of the set `\{1,2,3\}`::

        sage: SetPartitions(3).cardinality()
        5

    Here is the list of them::

        sage: SetPartitions(3).list()
        [{{1, 2, 3}}, {{1, 2}, {3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}, {{1}, {2, 3}}, {{1}, {2}, {3}}]

    There are 6 set partitions of `\{1,2,3,4\}` whose underlying partition is
    `[2, 1, 1]`::

        sage: SetPartitions(4, [2,1,1]).list()
        [{{1}, {2, 4}, {3}},
         {{1}, {2}, {3, 4}},
         {{1, 4}, {2}, {3}},
         {{1, 3}, {2}, {4}},
         {{1, 2}, {3}, {4}},
         {{1}, {2, 3}, {4}}]

    Since :trac:`14140`, we can create a set partition directly by
    :class:`SetPartition`, which creates the base set by taking the
    union of the parts passed in::

        sage: s = SetPartition([[1,3],[2,4]]); s
        {{1, 3}, {2, 4}}
        sage: s.parent()

class SetPartitions(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
    r"""
    An (unordered) partition of a set `S` is a set of pairwise
    disjoint nonempty subsets with union `S`, and is represented
    by a sorted list of such subsets.

    ``SetPartitions(s)`` returns the class of all set partitions of the set
    ``s``, which can be given as a set or a string; if a string, each
    character is considered an element.

    ``SetPartitions(n)``, where ``n`` is an integer, returns the class of
    all set partitions of the set `\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}`.

    You may specify a second argument `k`. If `k` is an integer,
    :class:`SetPartitions` returns the class of set partitions into `k` parts;
    if it is an integer partition, :class:`SetPartitions` returns the class of
    set partitions whose block sizes correspond to that integer partition.

    The Bell number `B_n`, named in honor of Eric Temple Bell,
    is the number of different partitions of a set with `n` elements.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: S = [1,2,3,4]
        sage: SetPartitions(S, 2)
        Set partitions of {1, 2, 3, 4} with 2 parts

        This algorithm counts for each block of the partition the
        number of ways to fill it using values from the set.  Then,
        for each distinct value `v` of block size, we divide the result by
        the number of ways to arrange the blocks of size `v` in the
        set partition.

        For example, if we want to count the number of set partitions
        of size 13 having [3,3,3,2,2] as underlying partition we
        compute the number of ways to fill each block of the
        partition, which is `\binom{13}{3} \binom{10}{3} \binom{7}{3}
        \binom{4}{2}\binom{2}{2}` and as we have three blocks of size
