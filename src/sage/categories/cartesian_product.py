class CartesianProductFunctor(CovariantFunctorialConstruction):
    """
    A singleton class for the Cartesian product functor

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: cartesian_product
        The cartesian_product functorial construction

    ``cartesian_product`` takes a finite collection of sets, and
    constructs the Cartesian product of those sets::

        sage: A = FiniteEnumeratedSet(['a','b','c'])
        sage: B = FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2])
        sage: C = cartesian_product([A, B]); C
        The cartesian product of ({'a', 'b', 'c'}, {1, 2})
        sage: C.an_element()
        ('a', 1)
        sage: C.list()         # todo: not implemented
        [['a', 1], ['a', 2], ['b', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 1], ['c', 2]]

    If those sets are endowed with more structure, say they are
    monoids (hence in the category `Monoids()`), then the result is
    automatically endowed with its natural monoid structure::

         sage: M = Monoids().example()
         sage: M
         An example of a monoid: the free monoid generated by ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
         sage: M.rename('M')
         sage: C = cartesian_product([M, ZZ, QQ])
         sage: C
         The cartesian product of (M, Integer Ring, Rational Field)
         sage: C.an_element()
         ('abcd', 1, 1/2)
         sage: C.an_element()^2
         ('abcdabcd', 1, 1/4)
         sage: C.category()
         Category of Cartesian products of monoids

         sage: Monoids().CartesianProducts()
         Category of Cartesian products of monoids

    The Cartesian product functor is covariant: if ``A`` is a
    subcategory of ``B``, then ``A.CartesianProducts()`` is a
    subcategory of ``B.CartesianProducts()`` (see also
    :class:`~sage.categories.covariant_functorial_construction.CovariantFunctorialConstruction`)::

         sage: C.categories()
         [Category of Cartesian products of monoids,
          Category of monoids,
          Category of Cartesian products of semigroups,
          Category of semigroups,
          Category of Cartesian products of magmas,
          Category of unital magmas,
          Category of magmas,
          Category of Cartesian products of sets,
          Category of sets,
          Category of sets with partial maps,
          Category of objects]

    Hence, the role of ``Monoids().CartesianProducts()`` is solely to
    provide mathematical information and algorithms which are relevant
    to Cartesian product of monoids. For example, it specifies that
    the result is again a monoid, and that its multiplicative unit is
    the cartesian product of the units of the underlying sets::

        sage: C.one()
        ('', 1, 1)

    Those are implemented in the nested class
    :class:`Monoids.CartesianProducts
    <sage.categories.monoids.Monoids.CartesianProducts>` of
    ``Monoids(QQ)``. This nested class is itself a subclass of
    :class:`CartesianProductsCategory`.
