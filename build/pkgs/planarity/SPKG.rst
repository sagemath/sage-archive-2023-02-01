planarity: Planarity-related graph algorithms
=============================================

Description
-----------

This code project provides a library for implementing graph algorithms
as well as implementations of several planarity-related graph
algorithms. The origin of this project is the reference implementation
for the Edge Addition Planarity Algorithm [1], which is now the fastest
and simplest linear-time method for planar graph embedding and planarity
obstruction isolation (i.e. Kuratowski subgraph isolation).
