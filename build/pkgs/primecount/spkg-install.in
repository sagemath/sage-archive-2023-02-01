# build system that appends -mpopcnt to the compiler flags whenever
# the compiler supports it.  (Note that with gcc, WITH_POPCNT=OFF
# does NOT actually disable use of the popcount intrinsics.)

# Without CMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED=ON, cmake uses -isystem for
# the primesieve include directory. But when that is SAGE_LOCAL, per
# https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Directory-Options.html, "If a
# standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
# -isystem, is also specified with -I, the -I option is ignored. The
# directory is still searched but as a system directory at its normal
# position in the system include chain."
# Thus this will cause system includes take precedence over SAGE_LOCAL/include.
# In particular, an old system package primesieve will take precedence
# over primesieve in SAGE_LOCAL.
