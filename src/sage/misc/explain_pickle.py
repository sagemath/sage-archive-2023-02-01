A tool for inspecting Python pickles

The explain_pickle function takes a pickle and produces Sage code that
will evaluate to the contents of the pickle.  Ideally, the combination
of explain_pickle to produce Sage code and sage_eval to evaluate the code
would be a 100% compatible implementation of cPickle's unpickler; this
is almost the case now.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: explain_pickle(dumps(12345))
    pg_make_integer = unpickle_global('sage.rings.integer', 'make_integer')
    pg_make_integer('c1p')
    sage: explain_pickle(dumps(polygen(QQ)))
    pg_Polynomial_rational_flint = unpickle_global('sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint', 'Polynomial_rational_flint')
    pg_PolynomialRing = unpickle_global('sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor', 'PolynomialRing')
    pg_RationalField = unpickle_global('sage.rings.rational_field', 'RationalField')
    pg = unpickle_instantiate(pg_RationalField, ())
    pg_make_rational = unpickle_global('sage.rings.rational', 'make_rational')
    pg_Polynomial_rational_flint(pg_PolynomialRing(pg, 'x', None, False), [pg_make_rational('0'), pg_make_rational('1')], False, True)
    sage: sage_eval(explain_pickle(dumps(polygen(QQ)))) == polygen(QQ)
    True

By default (as above) the code produced contains calls to several
utility functions (unpickle_global, etc.); this is done so that the
code is truly equivalent to the pickle.  If the pickle can be loaded
into a future version of Sage, then the code that explain_pickle
produces today should work in that future Sage as well.

It is also possible to produce simpler code, that is tied to the current
version of Sage; here are the above two examples again::

    sage: explain_pickle(dumps(12345), in_current_sage=True)
    from sage.rings.integer import make_integer
    make_integer('c1p')
    sage: explain_pickle(dumps(polygen(QQ)), in_current_sage=True)
    from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint import Polynomial_rational_flint
    from sage.rings.rational import make_rational
    Polynomial_rational_flint(PolynomialRing(RationalField(), 'x', None, False), [make_rational('0'), make_rational('1')], False, True)

The explain_pickle function has several use cases.

  - Write pickling support for your classes

    You can use explain_pickle to see what will happen when a pickle
    is unpickled.  Consider: is this sequence of commands something
    that can be easily supported in all future Sage versions, or does
    it expose internal design decisions that are subject to change?

  - Debug old pickles

    If you have a pickle from an old version of Sage that no longer
    unpickles, you can use explain_pickle to see what it is trying to
    do, to figure out how to fix it.

  - Use explain_pickle in doctests to help maintenance

    If you have a ``loads(dumps(S))`` doctest, you could also add an
    ``explain_pickle(dumps(S))`` doctest.  Then if something changes
    in a way that would invalidate old pickles, the output of
    ``explain_pickle`` will also change.  At that point, you can add
    the previous output of :obj:`explain_pickle` as a new set of
    doctests (and then update the :obj`explain_pickle` doctest to use
    the new output), to ensure that old pickles will continue to work.
    (These problems will also be caught using the :obj:`picklejar`,
    but having the tests directly in the relevant module is clearer.)

As mentioned above, there are several output modes for :obj:`explain_pickle`,
that control fidelity versus simplicity of the output.  For example,
the GLOBAL instruction takes a module name and a class name and
produces the corresponding class.  So GLOBAL of ``sage.rings.integer``,
``Integer`` is approximately equivalent to ``sage.rings.integer.Integer``.

However, this class lookup process can be customized (using
sage.structure.sage_object.register_unpickle_override).  For instance,
if some future version of Sage renamed ``sage/rings/integer.pyx`` to
``sage/rings/knuth_was_here.pyx``, old pickles would no longer work unless
register_unpickle_override was used; in that case, GLOBAL of
'sage.rings.integer', 'integer' would mean
``sage.rings.knuth_was_here.integer``.

By default, ``explain_pickle`` will map this GLOBAL instruction to
``unpickle_global('sage.rings.integer', 'integer')``.  Then when this code
is evaluated, unpickle_global will look up the current mapping in the
register_unpickle_override table, so the generated code will continue
to work even in hypothetical future versions of Sage where integer.pyx
has been renamed.

If you pass the flag ``in_current_sage=True``, then
:obj:`explain_pickle` will generate code that may only work in the
current version of Sage, not in future versions.  In this case, it
would generate::

  from sage.rings.integer import integer

and if you ran explain_pickle in hypothetical future sage, it would generate:

  from sage.rings.knuth_was_here import integer

but the current code wouldn't work in the future sage.

If you pass the flag ``default_assumptions=True``, then
:obj:`explain_pickle` will generate code that would work in the
absence of any special unpickling information.  That is, in either
current Sage or hypothetical future Sage, it would generate::

  from sage.rings.integer import integer

The intention is that ``default_assumptions`` output is prettier (more
human-readable), but may not actually work; so it is only intended for
human reading.

There are several functions used in the output of :obj:`explain_pickle`.
Here I give a brief description of what they usually do, as well as
how to modify their operation (for instance, if you're trying to get
old pickles to work).

  - ``unpickle_global(module, classname)``:
    unpickle_global('sage.foo.bar', 'baz') is usually equivalent to
    sage.foo.bar.baz, but this can be customized with
    register_unpickle_override.

  - ``unpickle_newobj(klass, args)``:
    Usually equivalent to ``klass.__new__(klass, *args)``.  If
    ``klass`` is a Python class, then you can define :meth:`__new__`
    to control the result (this result actually need not be an
    instance of klass).  (This doesn't work for Cython classes.)

  - ``unpickle_build(obj, state)``:
    If ``obj`` has a :meth:`__setstate__` method, then this is equivalent to
    ``obj.__setstate__(state)``.  Otherwise uses state to set the attributes
    of ``obj``.  Customize by defining :meth:`__setstate__`.

  - ``unpickle_instantiate(klass, args)``:
    Usually equivalent to ``klass(*args)``.  Cannot be customized.

  - unpickle_appends(lst, vals):
    Appends the values in vals to lst.  If not ``isinstance(lst, list)``,
    can be customized by defining a :meth:`append` method.

    Explain a pickle. That is, produce source code such that evaluating
    the code is equivalent to loading the pickle.  Feeding the result
    of ``explain_pickle`` to ``sage_eval`` should be totally equivalent to loading
    the ``pickle`` with ``cPickle``.

    INPUT:

     - ``pickle``   -- the pickle to explain, as a string (default: None)
     - ``file``     -- a filename of a pickle (default: None)
     - ``compress`` -- if False, don't attempt to decompress the pickle
                    (default: True)
     - ``in_current_sage`` -- if True, produce potentially simpler code that is
                           tied to the current version of Sage. (default: False)
     - ``default_assumptions`` -- if True, produce potentially simpler code that
                               assumes that generic unpickling code will be
                               used.  This code may not actually work.
                               (default: False)
     - ``eval`` -- if True, then evaluate the resulting code and return the
                evaluated result. (default: False)
     - ``preparse`` -- if True, then produce code to be evaluated with
                    Sage's preparser; if False, then produce standard
                    Python code; if None, then produce code that will work
                    either with or without the preparser.  (default: True)
     - ``pedantic`` -- if True, then carefully ensures that the result has
                    at least as much sharing as the result of cPickle
                    (it may have more, for immutable objects).  (default: False)

    Exactly one of ``pickle`` (a string containing a pickle) or
    ``file`` (the filename of a pickle) must be provided.

def test_pickle(p, verbose_eval=False, pedantic=False, args=()):
    r"""
    Tests explain_pickle on a given pickle p.  p can be:

    - a string containing an uncompressed pickle (which will always end
      with a '.')

    - a string containing a pickle fragment (not ending with '.')
      test_pickle will synthesize a pickle that will push args onto
      the stack (using persistent IDs), run the pickle fragment, and then
      STOP (if the string 'mark' occurs in args, then a mark will be pushed)

    - an arbitrary object; test_pickle will pickle the object

    Once it has a pickle, test_pickle will print the pickle's
    disassembly, run explain_pickle with in_current_sage=True and
    False, print the results, evaluate the results, unpickle the
    object with cPickle, and compare all three results.

    If verbose_eval is True, then test_pickle will print messages
    before evaluating the pickles; this is to allow for tests where
    the unpickling prints messages (to verify that the same operations
    occur in all cases).
