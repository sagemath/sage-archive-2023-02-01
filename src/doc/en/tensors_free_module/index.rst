Tensors on free modules of finite rank
======================================

This is the reference manual for tensors on free modules of finite rank over
a commutative ring.

This work is part of the `SageManifolds project <http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/>`_
but it does not depend upon other SageManifolds classes. In other words, it 
constitutes a self-consistent subset that can be used independently of 
SageManifolds.
