Cutwidth

This module implements several algorithms to compute the cutwidth of a graph and
the corresponding ordering of the vertices. It also implements tests functions
for evaluation the width of a linear ordering (or layout).

Given an ordering
`v_1,\cdots, v_n` of the vertices of `V(G)`, its *cost* is defined as:

.. MATH::

    c(v_1, ..., v_n) = \max_{1\leq i \leq n-1} c'(\{v_1, ..., v_i\})

Where

.. MATH::

    c'(S) = |\{(u,w)\in E(G)\mid u\in S\text{ and }w\in V(G)\backslash S\}|

The *cutwidth* of a graph `G` is equal to the minimum cost of an ordering of its
vertices.


**This module contains the following methods**

    :meth:`cutwidth` | Return the cutwidth of the graph and the corresponding vertex ordering.
    :meth:`cutwidth_dyn` | Compute the cutwidth of `G` using an exponential time and space algorithm based on dynamic programming
    :meth:`cutwidth_MILP` | Compute the cutwidth of `G` and the optimal ordering of its vertices using an MILP formulation
    :meth:`width_of_cut_decomposition` | Return the width of the cut decomposition induced by the linear ordering `L` of the vertices of `G`


Exponential algorithm for cutwidth
----------------------------------

In order to find an optimal ordering of the vertices for the vertex separation,
this algorithm tries to save time by computing the function `c'(S)` **at most
once** once for each of the sets `S\subseteq V(G)`. These values are stored in
an array of size `2^n` where reading the value of `c'(S)` or updating it can be
done in constant time.

Assuming that we can compute the cost of a set `S` and remember it, finding an
optimal ordering is an easy task. Indeed, we can think of the sequence `v_1,
..., v_n` of vertices as a sequence of *sets* `\{v_1\}, \{v_1,v_2\}, ...,
\{v_1,...,v_n\}`, whose cost is precisely `\max c'(\{v_1\}), c'(\{v_1,v_2\}),
... , c'(\{v_1,...,v_n\})`. Hence, when considering the digraph on the `2^n`
sets `S\subseteq V(G)` where there is an arc from `S` to `S'` if `S'=S\cap
\{v\}` for some `v` (that is, if the sets `S` and `S'` can be consecutive in a
sequence), an ordering of the vertices of `G` corresponds to a *path* from
`\emptyset` to `\{v_1,...,v_n\}`. In this setting, checking whether there exists
a ordering of cost less than `k` can be achieved by checking whether there
exists a directed path `\emptyset` to `\{v_1,...,v_n\}` using only sets of cost
less than `k`. This is just a depth-first-search, for each `k`.

**Lazy evaluation of** `c'`

In the previous algorithm, most of the time is actually spent on the computation
of `c'(S)` for each set `S\subseteq V(G)` -- i.e. `2^n` computations of
neighborhoods. This can be seen as a huge waste of time when noticing that it is
useless to know that the value `c'(S)` for a set `S` is less than `k` if all the
paths leading to `S` have a cost greater than `k`. For this reason, the value of
`c'(S)` is computed lazily during the depth-first search. Explanation :

When the depth-first search discovers a set of size less than `k`, the costs of
its out-neighbors (the potential sets that could follow it in the optimal
ordering) are evaluated. When an out-neighbor is found that has a cost smaller
than `k`, the depth-first search continues with this set, which is explored with
the hope that it could lead to a path toward `\{v_1,...,v_n\}`. On the other
hand, if an out-neighbour has a cost larger than `k` it is useless to attempt to
build a cheap sequence going though this set, and the exploration stops
there. This way, a large number of sets will never be evaluated and *a lot* of
computational time is saved this way.

Besides, some improvement is also made by "improving" the values found by
`c'`. Indeed, `c'(S)` is a lower bound on the cost of a sequence containing the
set `S`, but if all out-neighbors of `S` have a cost of `c'(S) + 5` then one
knows that having `S` in a sequence means a total cost of at least `c'(S) +
5`. For this reason, for each set `S` we store the value of `c'(S)`, and replace
it by `\max (c'(S), \min_{\text{next}})` (where `\min_{\text{next}}` is the
minimum of the costs of the out-neighbors of `S`) once the costs of these
out-neighbors have been evaluated by the algorithm.

This algorithm and its implementation are very similar to
:meth:`sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation.vertex_separation_exp`.
The main difference is in the computation of `c'(S)`. See the :mod:`vertex
separation module's documentation
<sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation>` for more details on this
algorithm.

.. NOTE::

    Because of its current implementation, this algorithm only works on graphs
    on strictly less than 32 vertices. This can be changed to 64 if necessary,
    but 32 vertices already require 4GB of memory.


MILP formulation for the cutwidth
---------------------------------

We describe a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for determining an
optimal layout for the cutwidth of `G`.

**Variables:**

- `x_v^k` -- Variable set to 1 if vertex `v` is placed in the ordering at
  position `i` with `i\leq k`, and 0 otherwise.

- `y_{u,v}^{k}` -- Variable set to 1 if one of `u` or `v` is at a position
  `i\leq k` and the other is at a position `j>k`, and so we have to count edge
  `uv` at position `k`. Otherwise, `y_{u,v}^{k}=0`. The value of `y_{u,v}^{k}`
  is a xor of the values of `x_u^k` and `x_v^k`.

- `z` -- Objective value to minimize. It is equal to the maximum over all
  position `k` of the number of edges with one extremity at position at most `k`
  and the other at position stricly more than `k`, that is `\sum_{uv\in
  E}y_{u,v}^{k}`.


**MILP formulation:**

.. MATH::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{alignat*}{2}
    \intertext{Minimize:}
    &z&\\
    \intertext{Subject to:}
    \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}x_v^i &\leq k*x_v^{k} & \forall v\in V,\ k\in[1,n-1] \quad(1)\\
    x_v^n & =1  & \quad \forall v\in V \quad(2)\\
    \sum_{v\in V}x_v^k & = k+1 &\quad  \forall k\in[0,n-1] \quad(3)\\
    x_u^k - x_v^k & \leq y_{u,v}^k &\quad  \forall uv\in E,\ \forall k\in[0,n-1]  \quad(4)\\
    x_v^k - x_u^k & \leq y_{u,v}^k &\quad  \forall uv\in E,\ \forall k\in[0,n-1] \quad(5)\\
    \sum_{uv\in E}y_{u,v}^k &\leq z &\quad  \forall k\in[0,n-1] \quad(6)\\
    0 \leq z &\leq |E|
    \end{alignat*}

Constraints (1)-(3) ensure that all vertices have a distinct position.
Constraints (4)-(5) force variable `y_{u,v}^k` to 1 if the edge is in the cut.
Constraint (6) count the number of edges starting at position at most `k` and
ending at a position stricly larger than `k`.

This formulation corresponds to method :meth:`cutwidth_MILP`.

      feasible solution.

    - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP) solver to
      be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For more information
      on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see the method
      :meth:`solve<sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the
      class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram<sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of verbosity. Set
      to 0 by default, which means quiet.

    OUTPUT:

    A pair ``(cost, ordering)`` representing the optimal ordering of the
    vertices and its cost.

    EXAMPLE:

    Cutwidth of a Cycle graph::

        sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions import cutwidth
        sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
        sage: cw, L = cutwidth.cutwidth_MILP(G); cw
        2
        sage: cw == cutwidth.width_of_cut_decomposition(G, L)
        True
        sage: cwe, Le = cutwidth.cutwidth_dyn(G); cwe
        2

    Cutwidth of a Complete graph::

        sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions import cutwidth
        sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
        sage: cw, L = cutwidth.cutwidth_MILP(G); cw
        4
        sage: cw == cutwidth.width_of_cut_decomposition(G, L)
        True

    Cutwidth of a Path graph::

        sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions import cutwidth
        sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(3)
        sage: cw, L = cutwidth.cutwidth_MILP(G); cw
        1
        sage: cw == cutwidth.width_of_cut_decomposition(G, L)
        True

    TESTS:

    Comparison with exponential algorithm::

        sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions import cutwidth
        sage: for i in range(2):  # long test
        ....:     G = graphs.RandomGNP(7, 0.3)
        ....:     ve, le = cutwidth.cutwidth_dyn(G)
        ....:     vm, lm = cutwidth.cutwidth_MILP(G, solver='GLPK')
        ....:     if ve != vm:
        ....:        print "The solution is not optimal!"

    Giving a too large lower bound::

        sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.cutwidth import cutwidth_MILP
        sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(3)
        sage: cutwidth_MILP(G, lower_bound=G.size()+1)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        MIPSolverException: ...

    Giving anything else than a Graph::

        sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.cutwidth import cutwidth_MILP
        sage: cutwidth_MILP([])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
