r"""
This module contains Cython code for a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Once Cython implements closures and the ``yield`` keyword is possible, this can be moved into the ``sage.games.sudoku`` module, as part of the ``Sudoku.backtrack`` method, and this module can be banned.

def backtrack_all(n, puzzle):
    r"""
    A routine to compute all the solutions to a Sudoku puzzle.

    INPUT:

        - ``n`` - the size of the puzzle, where the array is an `n^2\times n^2` grid

        - ``puzzle`` - a list of the entries of the puzzle (1-based), in row-major order

    OUTPUT:

        A list of solutions, where each solution is a (1-based) list similar to ``puzzle``.

    TESTS:

    This is just a cursory test here, since eventually this code will move.
    See the `backtrack` method of the `Sudoku` class in the
    `sage.games.sudoku` module for more enlightening examples. ::

        sage: from sage.games.sudoku_backtrack import backtrack_all
        sage: c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        sage: print(backtrack_all(3, c))
        [[6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 9, 8, 7, 8, 3, 1, 4, 7, 9, 5, 2, 6, 2, 9, 7, 6, 8, 5, 4, 1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 5, 3, 8, 6, 9, 1, 3, 8, 5, 1, 9, 6, 2, 7, 4, 9, 1, 6, 7, 2, 4, 3, 5, 8, 5, 6, 8, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, 7, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 8, 6, 9, 1, 2, 9, 8, 6, 3, 7, 4, 5]]

    ALGORITHM:

    We traverse a search tree depth-first.  Each level of the tree corresponds to a location in the grid, listed in row-major order.  At each location we maintain a list of the symbols which may be used in that location as follows.

    A location has "peers", which are the locations in the same row, column or box (sub-grid).  As symbols are chosen (or fixed initially) at a location, they become ineligible for use at a peer.  We track this in the ``available`` array where at each location each symbol has a count of how many times it has been made ineligible.  As this counter transitions between 0 and 1, the number of eligible symbols at a location is tracked in the ``card`` array.  When the number of eligible symbols at any location becomes 1, then we know that *must* be the symbol employed in that location.  This then allows us to further update the eligible symbols at the peers of that location.  When the number of the eligible symbols at any location becomes 0, then we know that we can prune the search tree.

    So at each new level of the search tree, we propagate as many fixed symbols as we can, placing them into a two-ended queue (``fixed`` and ``fixed_symbol``) that we process until it is empty or we need to prune.  All this recording of ineligible symbols and numbers of eligible symbols has to be unwound as we backup the tree, though.

    The notion of propagating singleton cells forward comes from an essay by Peter Norvig [sudoku:norvig]_.
