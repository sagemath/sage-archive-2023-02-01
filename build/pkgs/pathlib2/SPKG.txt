== Description ==

Object-oriented filesystem paths

The old pathlib module on bitbucket is in bugfix-only mode. The goal
of pathlib2 is to provide a backport of standard pathlib module which
tracks the standard library module, so all the newest features of the
standard pathlib can be used also on older Python versions.
