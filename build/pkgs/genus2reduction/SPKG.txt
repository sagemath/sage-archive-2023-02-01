This is the home of genus2reduction, so there isn't an auxiliary download
cite for updates.  If building this breaks because PARI changes, this is
the place to fix it.

=== genus2reduction-0.3.p2 (William Stein, Feb. 21st, 2008) ===
   * Put -lgmp -lm *back* in the build line.  Tim Abbot had removed them claiming they aren't
     needed, but that's not correct.  They are needed, since, e.g., pari relies on them.
     Maybe they aren't needed on LInux for some reason, but on OS X they definitely are.
     Please don't remove them again.
