Galois representations attached to elliptic curves

Given an elliptic curve `E` over `\QQ`
and a rational prime number `p`, the `p^n`-torsion
`E[p^n]` points of `E` is a representation of the
absolute Galois group `G_{\QQ}` of `\QQ`. As `n` varies
we obtain the Tate module `T_p E` which is a
a representation of `G_\QQ` on a free `\ZZ_p`-module
of rank `2`. As `p` varies the representations
are compatible.

Currently sage can decide whether the Galois module
`E[p]` is reducible, i.e., if `E` admits an isogeny
of degree `p`, and whether the image of
the representation on `E[p]` is surjective onto
`\text{Aut}(E[p]) = GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)`.

The following are the most useful functions for the class ``GaloisRepresentation``.

For the reducibility:

- ``is_reducible(p)``
- ``is_irreducible(p)``
- ``reducible_primes()``

For the image:

- ``is_surjective(p)``
- ``non_surjective()``
- ``image_type(p)``

For the classification of the representation

- ``is_semistable(p)``
- ``is_unramified(p, ell)``
- ``is_crystalline(p)``

EXAMPLES::

    sage: E = EllipticCurve('196a1')
    sage: rho = E.galois_representation()
    sage: rho.is_irreducible(7)
    True
    sage: rho.is_reducible(3)
    True
    sage: rho.is_irreducible(2)
    True
    sage: rho.is_surjective(2)
    False
    sage: rho.is_surjective(3)
    False
    sage: rho.is_surjective(5)
    True
    sage: rho.reducible_primes()
    [3]
    sage: rho.non_surjective()
    [2, 3]
    sage: rho.image_type(2)
    'The image is cyclic of order 3.'
    sage: rho.image_type(3)
    'The image is contained in a Borel subgroup as there is a 3-isogeny.'
    sage: rho.image_type(5)
    'The image is all of GL_2(F_5).'

For semi-stable curve it is known that the representation is
surjective if and only if it is irreducible::

    sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
    sage: rho = E.galois_representation()
    sage: rho.non_surjective()
    [5]
    sage: rho.reducible_primes()
    [5]

For cm curves it is not true that there are only finitely many primes for which the
Galois representation mod p is surjective onto `GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)`::

    sage: E = EllipticCurve('27a1')
    sage: rho = E.galois_representation()
    sage: rho.non_surjective()
    [0]
    sage: rho.reducible_primes()
    [3]
    sage: E.has_cm()
    True
    sage: rho.image_type(11)
    'The image is contained in the normalizer of a non-split Cartan group. (cm)'

        1. If `p \geq 5` then the mod-p representation is
           surjective if and only if the p-adic representation is
           surjective. When `p = 2, 3` there are
           counterexamples. See papers of Dokchitsers and Elkies
           for more details.

        2. For the primes `p=2` and 3, this will always answer either
           True or False. For larger primes it might give None.

            # I would have thought that this is the easier part: to

            # field Q(E[3]) has Galois group GL_2(Z/3) over Q.  Let
            # E[3]+ be the subfield fixed by the element -1 of
            # GL_2(Z/3).  Then E[3] has Galois group PGL_2(Z/3), which
            # is identified with S_4 by its action on the four
            # 3-element subgroups of E[3].  Each such subgroup is in
            # turn determined by the x-coordinate shared by its two
            # nonzero points.  So, if E[3] is surjective then any
            # permutation of those x-coordinates is realized by some

        Returns a list of primes p such that the mod-p representation
        *might* not be surjective. If `p` is not in the returned list,
        then the mod-p representation is provably surjective.

        By a theorem of Serre, there are only finitely
        many primes in this list, except when the curve has
        complex multiplication.

        If the curve has CM, we simply return the
        sequence [0] and do no further computation.

        INPUT:

        - ``A`` - an integer (default 1000). By increasing this parameter
          the resulting set might get smaller.

        OUTPUT:

        -  ``list`` - if the curve has CM, returns [0].
           Otherwise, returns a list of primes where mod-p representation is
           very likely not surjective. At any prime not in this list, the
           representation is definitely surjective.

        This function returns, given the representation `\rho`
        a list of `p` values that add up to 1, representing the
        frequency of the conjugacy classes of the projective image
        of `\rho` in `PGL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)`.

        Let `M` be a matrix in `GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)`, then define
        `u(M) = \text{tr}(M)^2/\det(M)`, which only depends on the
        conjugacy class of `M` in `PGL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)`. Hence this defines
        a map `u: PGL_2(\mathbb{F}_p) \to \mathbb{F}_p`, which is almost
        a bijection between conjugacy classes of the source
        and `\mathbb{F}_p` (the elements of order `p` and the identity
        map to `4` and both classes of elements of order 2 map to 0).

        This function returns the frequency with which the values of
        `u` appeared among the images of the Frobenius elements
        `a_{\ell}`at `\ell` for good primes `\ell\neq p` below a
        given ``bound``.

        INPUT:

        -  a prime ``p``

        -  a natural number ``bound`` (optional, default=10000)

        OUTPUT:

        - a list of `p` real numbers in the interval `[0,1]` adding up to 1

        REMARKS:

        Conjugacy classes of subgroups of `PGL_2(\mathbb{F}_5)`

        For the case `p=5`, the order of an element determines almost the value of `u`:

        +-------+---+---+---+---+--------+
        |`u`    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4      |
        +-------+---+---+---+---+--------+
        |orders | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 1 or 5 |
        +-------+---+---+---+---+--------+

        Here we give here the full table of all conjugacy classes of subgroups with the values
        that ``image_classes`` should give (as ``bound`` tends to `\infty`). Comparing with the output
        of the above examples, it is now easy to guess what the image is.
