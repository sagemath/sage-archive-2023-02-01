== Description ==

John Cremona's programs for enumerating and computating with elliptic
curves defined over the rational numbers. This is the culmination of
over 25 years of hard work.

=== Special Update/Build Instructions ===

 * The makefiles do use GNU extensions. This causes build failures on systems like FreeBSD where GNU's make is usually called gmake. A workaround is to create a symlink from gmake to make in {{{~/bin}}} and to add that directory to {{{$PATH}}} before the directory that contains the BSD make

== Changelog ==

=== eclib-20100711 (John Cremona, 11 July 2010) ===
 * Four changesets applied to source code, including
 * Implementation of support for "minus space" modular symbols spaces
 * Some improvements to sparse linear algebra (nothing dramatic)

=== eclib-20080310.p10 (Mitesh Patel, 2nd March 2010) ===

=== eclib-20080310.p9 (John Cremona, 2nd February 2010) ===
 * Fix bug in second descent (R-solubility not tested)
 * Enhance descent interface by providing separate rank_bound and
   selmer_rank functions

=== eclib-20080310.p8 (David Kirkby, 2nd January 2010) ===
