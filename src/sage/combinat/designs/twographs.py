Two-graphs

A two-graph on `n` points is a family `T \subset \binom {[n]}{3}`
of `3`-sets, such that any `4`-set `S\subset [n]` of size four
contains an even number of elements of `T`. Any graph `([n],E)`
gives rise to a two-graph
`T(E)=\{t \in \binom {[n]}{3} : \left| \binom {t}{2} \cap E \right|\ odd \}`,
and any two graphs with the same two-graph can be obtained one
from the other by :meth:`Seidel switching <Graph.seidel_switching>`.
This defines an equivalence relation on the graphs on `[n]`,
called Seidel switching equivalence.
Conversely, given a two-graph `T`, one can construct a graph
`\Gamma` in the corresponding Seidel switching class with an
isolated vertex `w`. The graph `\Gamma \setminus w` is called
the :meth:`descendant <TwoGraph.descendant>` of `T` w.r.t. `v`.

`T` is called regular if each two-subset of `[n]` is contained
in the same number alpha of triples of `T`.

This module implements a direct construction of a two-graph from a list of
triples, construction of descendant graphs, regularity checking, and other
things such as constructing the complement two-graph, cf. [BH2012]_.
