    r"""
    Dense matrix over a univariate polynomial ring over a field.

    For a field $\Bold{K}$, we consider matrices over the univariate
    polynomial ring $\Bold{K}[x]$.

    They are often used to represent bases of some $\Bold{K}[x]$-modules. In
    this context, there are two possible representations which are both
    commonly used in the literature.

    - Working column-wise: each column of the matrix is a vector in the basis;
      then, a $\\Bold{K}[x]$-submodule of $\\Bold{K}[x]^{m}$ of rank $n$ is
      represented by an $m \\times n$ matrix, whose columns span the module
      (via $\\Bold{K}[x]$-linear combinations). This matrix has full rank,
      and $n \\leq m$.

    - Working row-wise: each row of the matrix is a vector in the basis; then,
      a $\\Bold{K}[x]$-submodule of $\\Bold{K}[x]^{n}$ of rank $m$ is
      represented by an $m \\times n$ matrix, whose rows span the module (via
      $\\Bold{K}[x]$-linear combinations). This matrix has full rank, and $m
      \\leq n$.

    For the rest of this class description, we assume that one is working
    row-wise. For a given such module, all its bases are equivalent under
    left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix, that is, a square matrix which
    has determinant in $\Bold{K}\setminus\{0\}$.

    There are bases which are called reduced or minimal: their rows have the
    minimal degree possible among all bases of this module; here the degree of
    a row is the maximum of the degrees of the entries of the row. An
    equivalent condition is that the leading matrix of this basis has full rank
    (see :meth:`leading_matrix`, :meth:`reduced_form`, :meth:`is_reduced`).
    There is a unique minimal basis, called the Popov basis of the module,
    which satisfies some additional normalization condition (see
    :meth:`popov_form`, :meth:`is_popov`).

    These notions can be extended via a more general degree measure, involving
    a tuple of integers which is called shift and acts as column degree shifts
    in the definition of row degree. Precisely, for given $s_1,\ldots,s_n \in
    \ZZ$ and a row vector $[p_1 \; \cdots \; p_n] \in \Bold{K}[x]^{1 \times
    n}$, its shifted row degree is the maximum of $\deg(p_j) + s_j$ for $1 \leq
    j \leq n$ (see :meth:`row_degrees`). Then, reduced bases and Popov bases
    are defined similarly, with respect to this notion of degree.

    Another important canonical basis is the Hermite basis, which is an upper
    triangular matrix satisfying a normalization condition similar to that for
    the Popov basis. In fact, if $d$ is the largest degree appearing in the
    Hermite basis, then the Hermite basis coincide with the shifted Popov basis
    with the shifts $((n-1)d,\ldots,2d,d,0)$.

        For an $m \times n$ polynomial matrix, if working row-wise then

        integer; here, the degree of the zero matrix is -1.

        OUTPUT: an integer.

    def degree_matrix(self, shifts=None, row_wise=True):
        r"""
        Return the matrix of the (shifted) degrees in this matrix.

        For a given polynomial matrix $M = (M_{i,j})_{i,j}$, its degree matrix
        is the matrix $(\deg(M_{i,j}))_{i,j}$ formed by the degrees of its
        entries. Here, the degree of the zero polynomial is $-1$.

        For given shifts $s_1,\ldots,s_m \in \ZZ$, the shifted degree
        matrix of $M$ is either $(\deg(M_{i,j})+s_j)_{i,j}$ if working
        row-wise, or $(\deg(M_{i,j})+s_i)_{i,j}$ if working column-wise. In the
        former case, $m$ has to be the number of columns of $M$; in the latter
        case, the number of its rows. Here, if $M_{i,j}=0$ then the
        corresponding entry in the shifted degree matrix is
        $\min(s_1,\ldots,s_m)-1$. For more on shifts and working row-wise
        versus column-wise, see the class documentation.

        INPUT:

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, if ``True``
          then shifts apply to the columns of the matrix and otherwise to its

        Return the matrix which is obtained from this matrix after reversing
        all its entries with respect to the degree as specified by ``degree``.

        Reversing a polynomial with respect to an integer `d` follows the
        convention for univariate polynomials, in particular it uses truncation
        or zero-padding as necessary if `d` differs from the degree of this
        polynomial.

        If ``entry_wise`` is ``True``: the input ``degree`` and ``row_wise``
        are ignored, and all entries of the matrix are reversed with respect to
        their respective degrees.

        If ``entry_wise`` is ``False`` (the default):

        - if ``degree`` is an integer, all entries are reversed with respect to
          it;
        - if ``degree`` is not provided, then all entries are reversed with
          respect to the degree of the whole matrix;

        INPUT:

        - ``degree`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) a list of nonnegative
          integers, or a nonnegative integer,

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, if ``True``
          (resp. ``False``) then ``degree`` should be a list of length equal to
          the row (resp. column) dimension of this matrix.

        - ``entry_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``False``) boolean, if ``True``
          then the input ``degree`` and ``row_wise`` are ignored.

        Return a matrix polynomial approximation of precision ``d`` of the

        Here matrix polynomial means that ``self`` is seen as a univariate
        polynomial with matrix coefficients, meaning that this method has the
        same output as if one: 1) converts this matrix to a univariate

        Raises a ``ZeroDivisionError`` if the constant matrix of ``self`` is
        not invertible (i.e. has zero determinant); raises an
        ``ArithmeticError`` if ``self`` is nonsquare; and raises a
        ``ValueError`` if the precision ``d`` is not positive.

        that `AB` and `BA` are the identity matrix modulo `x^d`, where `A` is

        polynomial matrix multiplications in size `m \times m` and in degree
        less than `2d`, where `m` is the row dimension of ``self``.

        r"""
        Try to find a solution `X` to the equation `X A = B`, at precision
        ``d``.

        If ``self`` is a matrix `A`, then this function returns a vector or
        matrix `X` such that `X A = B \bmod x^d`. If `B` is a vector then `X`
        is a vector, and if `B` is a matrix then `X` is a matrix.

        Raises ``ValueError`` if ``d`` is not strictly positive, or if there is
        a dimension mismatch between `A` and `B`, or if there is no solution to
        the given matrix equation at the specified precision.

        INPUT:

        - ``B`` -- a polynomial matrix or polynomial vector.

        - ``d`` -- a positive integer.

        OUTPUT:

        A solution to the matrix equation, returned as polynomial matrix of
        degree less than ``d`` if ``B`` is a polynomial matrix; a polynomial
        vector of degree less than ``d`` if `B` is a polynomial vector.

        ALGORITHM:

        If `A` is square with invertible constant term, then the unique
        solution is found by calling :meth:`inverse_series_trunc` and using the
        Dixon & Moenck-Carter iteration. Otherwise, a left minimal approximant
        basis of a matrix formed by `A` and `B` is computed, for an appropriate
        shift which ensures that this basis reveals either a solution `X` or
        the fact that no such solution exists.

        If working row-wise (resp. column-wise), a polynomial matrix is said to

        Return a (shifted) (ordered) weak Popov form of this matrix.

        See :meth:`is_weak_popov` for a definition of weak Popov forms. If the
        input matrix is $A$, a weak Popov form of $A$ is any matrix $P$ in weak
        Popov form and such that $UA = P$ for some unimodular matrix $U$. The
        latter matrix is called the transformation, and the first optional
        argument allows one to specify whether to return this transformation.

        Sometimes, one forbids weak Popov forms to have zero rows (resp.
        columns) in the above definitions; an optional parameter allows one to
        adopt this more restrictive setting. If zero rows (resp. columns) are
        allowed, the convention here is to place them as the bottommost rows
        (resp. the rightmost columns) of the output weak Popov form.

        Note that, if asking for the transformation and discarding zero vectors
        (i.e. ``transformation=True`` and ``include_zero_vectors=False``), then
        the returned transformation is still the complete unimodular matrix,
        including its bottommost rows (resp. rightmost columns) which
        correspond to zero rows (resp. columns) of the complete weak Popov
        form. In fact, this bottom part of the transformation yields a basis of
        the left (resp. right) kernel of the input matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``transformation`` -- (optional, default: ``False``). If this
          is ``True``, the transformation matrix `U` will be returned as well.

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        Return the (shifted) Popov form of this matrix.

        See :meth:`is_popov` for a definition of Popov forms. If the input
        matrix is $A$, the (shifted) Popov form of $A$ is the unique matrix $P$
        in (shifted) Popov form and such that $UA = P$ for some unimodular
        matrix $U$. The latter matrix is called the transformation, and the
        first optional argument allows one to specify whether to return this
        transformation. We refer to the description of :meth:`weak_popov_form`
        for an explanation of the option ``include_zero_vectors`` .

        INPUT:

        - ``transformation`` -- (optional, default: ``False``). If this
          is ``True``, the transformation matrix `U` will be returned as well.

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, ``True`` if
          working row-wise (see the class description).

        - ``include_zero_vectors`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean,
          ``False`` if zero rows (resp. zero columns) should be discarded from
          the Popov forms.

        OUTPUT:

        - A polynomial matrix which is the Popov form of ``self`` if
          ``transformation`` is ``False``; otherwise two polynomial matrices
          which are the Popov form of ``self`` and the corresponding unimodular
          transformation.

        This method implements the Mulders-Storjohann algorithm of [MS2003]_
        for transforming a weak Popov form into Popov form, straightforwardly
        extended to the case of shifted forms.

        Return a row reduced form of this matrix (resp. a column reduced form
        if the optional parameter ``row_wise`` is set to ``False``).

        An $m \times n$ univariate polynomial matrix $M$ is said to be in
        (shifted) row reduced form if it has $k$ nonzero rows with $k \leq n$
        and its (shifted) leading matrix has rank $k$. See :meth:`is_reduced`
        for more information.

        Currently, the implementation of this method is a direct call to
        :meth:`weak_popov_form`.

        INPUT:

        - ``transformation`` -- (optional, default: ``False``). If this
          is ``True``, the transformation matrix `U` will be returned as well:
          this is a unimodular matrix over `\Bold{K}[x]` such that ``self``
          equals `UR`, where `R` is the output matrix.

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, ``True`` if
          working row-wise (see the class description).

        - ``include_zero_vectors`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean,
          ``False`` if one does not allow zero rows in row reduced forms (resp.
          zero columns in column reduced forms).

        OUTPUT:

        - A polynomial matrix `R` which is a reduced form of ``self`` if
          ``transformation=False``; otherwise two polynomial matrices `R, U`
          such that `UA = R` and `R` is reduced and `U` is unimodular where `A`
          is ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: pR.<x> = GF(3)[]
            sage: A = matrix(pR,3,[x,   x^2, x^3,
            ....:                  x^2, x^1, 0,
            ....:                  x^3, x^3, x^3])

            sage: R.is_reduced()
            True
            sage: R2 = A.reduced_form(shifts=[6,3,0]); R2

            True
            sage: R2.is_reduced()
            False

        If the matrix is an `n \times 1` matrix with at least one non-zero entry,
        `R` has a single non-zero entry and that entry is a scalar multiple of
        the greatest-common-divisor of the entries of the matrix::

            sage: A = matrix([[x*(x-1)*(x+1)],[x*(x-2)*(x+2)],[x]])
            sage: R = A.reduced_form()
            sage: R
            [x]
            [0]
            [0]

        A zero matrix is already reduced::

            sage: A = matrix(pR, 2, [0,0,0,0])
            sage: A.reduced_form()
            [0 0]
            [0 0]

        In the following example, the original matrix is already reduced, but
        the output is a different matrix: currently this method is an alias for
        :meth:`weak_popov_form`, which is a stronger reduced form::

            sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
            sage: A = matrix([[x,x,x],[0,0,x]]); A
            [x x x]
            [0 0 x]
            sage: A.is_reduced()
            True
            sage: W = A.reduced_form(); W
            [ x  x  x]
            [-x -x  0]
            sage: W.is_weak_popov()
            True

        The last example shows the usage of the transformation parameter::

            sage: Fq.<a> = GF(2^3)
            sage: pR.<x> = Fq[]
            sage: A = matrix(pR, [[x^2+a,  x^4+a],
            ....:                  [  x^3,  a*x^4]])

        a reversed polynomial matrix `B`, generalizing to matrices the fast
        division of univariate polynomials.

        If `A` is a `k \times n` polynomial matrix, and the input `B` is an `m
        \times n` polynomial matrix such that `B` has full column rank, or more
        generally such that the matrix equation `A = XB` has a rational
        solution, then there exists such a `(Q,R)` but it may not be unique;
        the algorithm returns one such quotient and remainder. Here `Q` is `k
        \times m` and `R` is `k \times n`. In this case, this method follows
        the folklore approach based on solving the matrix equation `A = XB` and
        splitting `X` into its polynomial part and proper fraction part.

        Finally, if the matrix equation `A = XB` has no rational solution, this
        method computes the normal form `R` and quotient `Q` of the rows of `A`
        with respect to the row space of `B` (see :meth:`reduce`). Doing this
        for a well-chosen shift ensures that either `R` does not have column
        degrees less than those of `B`, and then there is no valid quotient and
        remainder, or it does satisfy this degree constraint, and then this `R`
        can be returned as a remainder along with the quotient `Q`.

        A ``ValueError`` is raised if the dimensions of ``self`` and `B` are
        not conformal, or if there exists no quotient and remainder.

        Algorithm: this method follows the folklore approach based on solving

        The same remark holds more generally for full column rank matrices:
        there exists a solution and this method will find one. However for all
        other cases (rank-deficient or strictly fewer rows than columns) there
        might be no solution::

        In the latter case (rank-deficient or strictly fewer rows than

        it::

    def reduce(self, B, shifts=None, row_wise=True, return_quotient=False):
        r"""
        Reduce ``self``, i.e. compute its normal form, modulo the row space of
        `B` with respect to ``shifts``.

        If ``self`` is a `k \times n` polynomial matrix (written `A` below),
        and the input `B` is an `m \times n` polynomial matrix, this computes
        the normal form `R` of `A` with respect the row space of `B` and the
        monomial order defined by ``shifts`` (written `s` below). This means
        that the `i` th row of `R` is equal to the `i` th row of `A` up to
        addition of an element in the row space of `B`, and if `J =
        (j_1,\ldots,j_r)` are the `s`-leading positions of the `s`-Popov form
        `P` of `A`, then the submatrix `R_{*,J}` (submatrix of `R` formed by
        its columns in `J`) has column degrees smaller entrywise than the
        column degrees of `P_{*,J}`.

        If the option ``row_wise`` is set to ``False``, the same operation is
        performed, but with everything considered column-wise: column space of
        `B`, `i` th column of `R` and `A`, column-wise `s`-leading positions
        and `s`-Popov form, and submatrices `R_{J,*}` and `P_{J,*}`.

        The operation above can be seen as a matrix generalization of division
        with remainder for univariate polynomials. If the option
        ``return_quotient`` is set to ``True``, this method returns both the
        normal form `R` and a quotient matrix `Q` such that `A = QB + R` (or `A
        = BQ + R` if ``row_wise`` is ``False``). Whereas the remainder is
        unique, this quotient is not unique unless `B` has a trivial left
        kernel i.e. has full row rank (or right kernel, full column rank if
        ``row_wise`` is ``False``).

        This method checks whether `B` is in `s`-Popov form, and if not,
        computes the `s`-Popov form `P` of `B`, which can take some time.
        Therefore, if `P` is already known or is to be re-used, this method
        should be called directly with `P`, yielding the same normal form `R`
        since `P` and `B` have the same row space (or column space, if
        ``row_wise`` is ``False``).

        A ``ValueError`` is raised if the dimensions of the shifts and/or of
        the matrices are not conformal.

        INPUT:

        - ``B`` -- polynomial matrix.

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, ``True`` if
          working row-wise (see the class description).

        - ``return_quotient`` -- (optional, default: ``False``). If this
          is ``True``, the quotient will be returned as well.

        OUTPUT: a polynomial matrix if ``return_quotient=False``, two
        polynomial matrices otherwise.

        The matrix `x^8 \mathrm{Id}_5` is square, nonsingular, in Popov form,
        and its rows are approximants for ``pmat`` at order 8. However, it is
        not an approximant basis since its rows generate a module strictly
        contained in the set of approximants for ``pmat`` at order 8::

            False

        Since ``pmat`` is a single column, with nonzero constant coefficient,
        its column-wise approximant bases at order 8 are all `1\times 1`
        matrices `[c x^8]` for some nonzero field element `c`::

        r"""
        Return an approximant basis in ``shifts``-ordered weak Popov form for
        this polynomial matrix at order ``order``.

        Assuming we work row-wise, if `F` is an `m \times n` polynomial matrix
        and `(d_0,\ldots,d_{n-1})` are positive integers, then an approximant
        basis for `F` at order `(d_0,\ldots,d_{n-1})` is a polynomial matrix
        whose rows form a basis of the module of approximants for `F` at order
        `(d_0,\ldots,d_{n-1})`. The latter approximants are the polynomial
        vectors `p` of size `m` such that the column `j` of `p F` has valuation
        at least `d_j`, for all `0 \le j \le n-1`.

        If ``normal_form`` is ``True``, then the output basis `P` is
        furthermore in ``shifts``-Popov form. By default, `P` is considered
        row-wise, that is, its rows are left-approximants for ``self``; if
        ``row_wise`` is ``False`` then its columns are right-approximants for
        ``self``. It is guaranteed that the degree of the output basis is at
        most the maximum of the entries of ``order``, independently of
        ``shifts``.

        An error is raised if the input dimensions are not sound: if working
        row-wise (resp. column-wise), the length of ``order`` must be the
        number of columns (resp. rows) of ``self``, while the length of
        ``shifts`` must be the number of rows (resp. columns) of ``self``.

        If a single integer is provided for ``order``, then it is converted
        into a list of repeated integers with this value.

        INPUT:

        - ``order`` -- a list of positive integers, or a positive integer.

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, if ``True``
          then the output basis is considered row-wise and operates on the left
          of ``self``; otherwise it is column-wise and operates on the right
          of ``self``.

        - ``normal_form`` -- (optional, default: ``False``) boolean, if
          ``True`` then the output basis is in ``shifts``-Popov form.

        OUTPUT: a polynomial matrix.

        ALGORITHM:

        The implementation is inspired from the iterative algorithms described
        in [VBB1992]_ and [BL1994]_ ; for obtaining the normal form, it relies
        directly on Lemmas 3.3 and 4.1 in [JNSV2016]_ .

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: pR.<x> = GF(7)[]

            sage: order = [4, 3]; shifts = [-1, 2, 0]
            sage: F = Matrix(pR, [[5*x^3 + 4*x^2 + 4*x + 6, 5*x^2 + 4*x + 1], \
                                  [        2*x^2 + 2*x + 3, 6*x^2 + 6*x + 3], \
                                  [4*x^3         +   x + 1, 4*x^2 + 2*x + 3] ])
            sage: P = F.minimal_approximant_basis(order, shifts)
            sage: P.is_minimal_approximant_basis(F, order, shifts)
            True

        By default, the computed basis is not required to be in normal form
        (and will not be except in rare special cases)::

            sage: P.is_minimal_approximant_basis(F, order, shifts, \
                                                    normal_form=True)
            False
            sage: P = F.minimal_approximant_basis(order, shifts, normal_form=True)
            sage: P.is_minimal_approximant_basis(F, order, shifts, \
                                                    normal_form=True)
            True

        If shifts are not specified, they are chosen as uniform `[0,\ldots,0]`
        by default. Besides, if the orders are all the same, one can rather
        give a single integer::

            sage: F.minimal_approximant_basis(3) == \
                    F.minimal_approximant_basis([3,3], shifts=None)
            True

        One can work column-wise by specifying ``row_wise=False``::

            sage: P = F.minimal_approximant_basis([5,2,2], [0,1], row_wise=False)
            sage: P.is_minimal_approximant_basis(F, [5,2,2], \
                                shifts=[0,1], row_wise=False)
            True
            sage: F.minimal_approximant_basis(3, row_wise=True) == \
                F.transpose().minimal_approximant_basis(3, row_wise=False).transpose()
            True

        Errors are raised if the input dimensions are not sound::

        Return ``True`` if and only if this matrix is a left kernel basis in
        ``shifts``-ordered weak Popov form for the polynomial matrix ``pmat``.

        If ``normal_form`` is ``True``, then the kernel basis must furthermore
        be in ``shifts``-Popov form. An error is raised if the input dimensions
        are not sound.

        INPUT:

        - ``pmat`` -- a polynomial matrix.

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, if ``True``
          then the basis is considered row-wise and operates on the left of
          ``pmat``; otherwise it is column-wise and operates on the right of
          ``pmat``.

        - ``normal_form`` -- (optional, default: ``False``) boolean, if
          ``True`` then checks for a basis in ``shifts``-Popov form.

        OUTPUT: a boolean.

        Verification that the matrix has full rank and is in shifted weak
        Popov form is done via :meth:`is_weak_popov`; verification that the
        matrix is a left kernel basis is done by checking that the rank is
        correct, that the product is indeed zero, and that the matrix is
        saturated, i.e. it has unimodular column bases (see Lemma 6.10 of
        https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01272.pdf for details).

        Return a left kernel basis in ``shifts``-ordered weak Popov form for
        this polynomial matrix.

        Assuming we work row-wise, if `F` is an `m \times n` polynomial matrix,
        then a left kernel basis for `F` is a polynomial matrix whose rows form
        a basis of the left kernel of `F`, which is the module of polynomial
        vectors `p` of size `m` such that `p F` is zero.

        If ``normal_form`` is ``True``, then the output basis `P` is
        furthermore in ``shifts``-Popov form. By default, `P` is considered
        row-wise, that is, its rows are left kernel vectors for ``self``; if
        ``row_wise`` is ``False`` then its columns are right kernel vectors for
        ``self``.

        An error is raised if the input dimensions are not sound: if working
        row-wise (resp. column-wise), the length of ``shifts`` must be the
        number of rows (resp. columns) of ``self``.

        INPUT:

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, if ``True``
          then the output basis considered row-wise and operates on the left
          of ``self``; otherwise it is column-wise and operates on the right
          of ``self``.

        - ``normal_form`` -- (optional, default: ``False``) boolean, if
          ``True`` then the output basis is in ``shifts``-Popov form.

        OUTPUT: a polynomial matrix.

        ALGORITHM: uses minimal approximant basis computation at a
        sufficiently large order so that the approximant basis contains
        a kernel basis as a submatrix.
