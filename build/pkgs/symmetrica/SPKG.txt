== Description ==

Symmetrica is a program developed by Lehrstuhl Mathematik II of the
University of Bayreuth. It has routines to handle the following topics

 * ordinary representation theory of the symmetric group and related groups (2/11/04)
 * ordinary representation theory of the classical groups
 * modular representation theory of the symmetric group
 * projective representation theory of the symmetric group
 * combinatorics of tableaux
 * symmetric functions and polynomials (7/22/04)
 * commutative and non commutative Schubert polynomials
 * operations of finite groups.
 * ordinary representation theory of Hecke algebras of type A_n

== SPKG Maintainers ==
 * Mike Hansen


== Upstream Contact ==
 * Axel Kohnert - see http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/axel/


== Dependencies ==
 * GNU patch (for applying the patches to upstream)


== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

The following patches are applied in spkg-install:

 * de.patch (Turn off banner)
 * macro.h.patch (Change some return types, this can be avoided)
 * sort_sum_rename.patch (rename sort to sym_sort, sum to sym_sum)
 * We copy over our own Makefile:
   patches/makefile (Fix compiler, i.e., use $CC, and let it use $CFLAGS.)

Permissions in the upstream tarball are funky, please run
"chmod 644 src/" after unpacking.


== Changelog ==

=== symmetrica-2.0.p7 (Leif Leonhardy, October 6th 2011) ===
 #10719 (Fix linker errors on OpenSUSE 11.2 and Ubuntu 11.10):
 Additional reviewer changes:
  * Add more error checks, normalize error messages.
  * Set up flags in spkg-check as well, as we build the test
    program there. Also use $MAKE there. Put CFLAG64 into
    LDFLAGS if appropriate (i.e. SAGE64=yes).
  * Clean up our Makefile, also use LDFLAGS when linking the test program.
  * Add GNU patch to the dependencies.

=== symmetrica-2.0.p6 (Volker Braun, 28th September 2011) ===
 * #10719: Change -lm option order in Makefile.
 * Removed dist/ directory (obsolete Debian stuff).
 * src/ is now the pristine upstream source, patches are applied in
   spkg-install.
 * Added spkg-check.

=== symmetrica-2.0.p5 (David Kirkby, 6th January 2009) ===
 * Allow SAGE64 to work on any platform, not just OS X.
 * Update the makefile to use '$(CC)' rather than use 'gcc'

=== symmetrica-2.0.p4 () ===
 * ???????????????????????

=== symmetrica-2.0.p3 (Michael Abshoff, May 15th, 2009) ===
 * Work around Solaris linker problem
 * Apply patches to src directly against policy - see above

=== symmetrica-2.0.p2 (Michael Abshoff, April 3rd, 2008) ===
 * OS 64 bit build support
 * make sure SAGE_ROOT is defined
 * Fix FreeBSD build issue
 * Build symmetrica with -fPIC on Debian (Tim Abbott, #2791)

=== symmetrica-2.0.p1 (Tim Abbott) ===
 * Add Debian build support

=== symmetrica-2.0.p0 (Mike Hansen) ===
 * Change compile flags to "-O1" to reduce compile time by 2/3.

=== symmetrica-2.0 (Mike Hansen) ===
 * update to latest release

=== symmetrica-0.3.3 (Mike Hansen) ===
