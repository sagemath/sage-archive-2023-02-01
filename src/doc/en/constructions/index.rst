Welcome to the Sage Constructions documentation!
================================================

This document collects the answers to some questions along the line
"How do I construct ... in Sage?" Though much of this material can
be found in the manual or tutorial or string documentation of the
Python code, it is hoped that this will provide the casual user
with some basic examples on how to start using Sage in a useful
way.
