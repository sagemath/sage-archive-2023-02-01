ISGCI: Information System on Graph Classes and their Inclusions

This module implements an interface to the `ISGCI <http://www.graphclasses.org/>`_ database in Sage.

This database gathers information on graph classes and their
inclusions in each other. It also contains information on the
complexity of several computational problems.

It is available on the `GraphClasses.org <http://www.graphclasses.org/>`_
website maintained by H.N. de Ridder et al.

How to use it?
--------------

Presently, it is possible to use this database through the variables and methods
present in the :obj:`graph_classes <GraphClasses>` object.
For instance::

    sage: Trees = graph_classes.Tree
    sage: Chordal = graph_classes.Chordal

Inclusions
^^^^^^^^^^

It is then possible to check the inclusion of classes inside of others, if the
information is available in the database::

    sage: Trees <= Chordal
    True

And indeed, trees are chordal graphs.

The ISGCI database is not all-knowing, and so comparing two classes can return
``True``, ``False``, or ``Unknown`` (see the :mod:`documentation of the Unknown
truth value <sage.misc.unknown>`).

An *unknown* answer to ``A <= B`` only means that ISGCI cannot deduce from the
information in its database that ``A`` is a subclass of ``B`` nor that it is
not. For instance, ISGCI does not know at the moment that some chordal graphs
are not trees::

    sage: graph_classes.Chordal <= graph_classes.Tree
    Unknown

Descriptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given a graph class, one can obtain its associated information in the ISGCI
database with the :meth:`~GraphClass.description` method::

    sage: Chordal.description()
    Class of graphs : Chordal
    -------------------------
    type                           :  base
    id                             :  gc_32
    name                           :  chordal

    Weighted clique                :  Polynomial
    Weighted feedback vertex set   :  Unknown
    Weighted independent set       :  Linear

It is possible to obtain the complete list of the classes stored in ISGCI by
calling the :meth:`~GraphClasses.show_all` method (beware -- long output)::

    sage: graph_classes.show_all()
    id        | name                                     | type                 | smallgraph
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    gc_309    | $K_4$--minor--free                       | base                 |
    gc_541    | $N^*$                                    | base                 |
    gc_215    | $N^*$--perfect                           | base                 |
    gc_5      | $P_4$--bipartite                         | base                 |
    gc_3      | $P_4$--brittle                           | base                 |
    gc_6      | $P_4$--comparability                     | base                 |
    gc_7      | $P_4$--extendible                        | base                 |
    ...

Until a proper search method is implemented, this lets one find
classes which do not appear in :obj:`graph_classes.* <GraphClasses>`.

To retrieve a class of graph from its ISGCI ID one may use
the :meth:`~GraphClasses.get_class` method::

    sage: GC = graph_classes.get_class("gc_5")
    sage: GC
    $P_4$--bipartite graphs

Recognition of graphs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The graph classes represented by the ISGCI database can alternatively be used to
access recognition algorithms. For instance, in order to check that a given
graph is a tree one has the following the options ::

    sage: graphs.PathGraph(5) in graph_classes.Tree
    True

or::

    sage: graphs.PathGraph(5).is_tree()
    True

Furthermore, all ISGCI graph classes which are defined by the exclusion of a
finite sequence of induced subgraphs benefit from a generic recognition
algorithm. For instance ::

    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: g in graph_classes.ClawFree
    False
    sage: g.line_graph() in graph_classes.ClawFree
    True

Or directly from ISGCI ::

    sage: gc = graph_classes.get_class("gc_441")
    sage: gc
    diamond--free graphs
    sage: graphs.PetersenGraph() in gc
    True

Sage's view of ISGCI
--------------------

The database is stored by Sage in two ways.

**The classes**: the list of all graph classes and their properties is stored
in a huge dictionary (see :meth:`~sage.graphs.isgci.GraphClasses.classes`).
Below is what Sage knows of ``gc_249``::

    sage: graph_classes.classes()['gc_249']        # random
    {'problem':
        {'Independent set': 'Polynomial',
         'Treewidth': 'Unknown',
         'Weighted independent set': 'Polynomial',
         'Cliquewidth expression': 'NP-complete',
         'Weighted clique': 'Polynomial',
         'Clique cover': 'Unknown',
         'Domination': 'NP-complete',
         'Clique': 'Polynomial',
         'Colourability': 'NP-complete',
         'Cliquewidth': 'Unbounded',
         '3-Colourability': 'NP-complete',
         'Recognition': 'Linear'},
     'type': 'base',
     'id': 'gc_249',
     'name': 'line'}

**The class inclusion digraph**: Sage remembers the class inclusions through
the inclusion digraph (see :meth:`~sage.graphs.isgci.GraphClasses.inclusion_digraph`).
Its nodes are ID of ISGCI classes::

    sage: d = graph_classes.inclusion_digraph()
    sage: d.vertices()[-10:]
    ['gc_990', 'gc_991', 'gc_992', 'gc_993', 'gc_994', 'gc_995', 'gc_996', 'gc_997', 'gc_998', 'gc_999']

An arc from ``gc1`` to ``gc2`` means that ``gc1`` is a superclass of
``gc2``. This being said, not all edges are stored ! To ensure that a given
class is included in another one, we have to check whether there is in the
digraph a ``path`` from the first one to the other::

    sage: bip_id = graph_classes.Bipartite._gc_id
    sage: perfect_id = graph_classes.Perfect._gc_id
    sage: d.has_edge(perfect_id, bip_id)
    False
    sage: d.distance(perfect_id, bip_id)
    2

Hence bipartite graphs are perfect graphs. We can see how ISGCI obtains this
result ::

    sage: p = d.shortest_path(perfect_id, bip_id)
    sage: len(p) - 1
    2
    sage: print p                  # random
    ['gc_56', 'gc_76', 'gc_69']
    sage: for c in p:
    ...      print graph_classes.get_class(c)
    perfect graphs
    ...
    bipartite graphs

What ISGCI knows is that perfect graphs contain unimodular graph which contain
bipartite graphs. Therefore bipartite graphs are perfect !

.. note::

    The inclusion digraph is **NOT ACYCLIC**. Indeed, several entries
    exist in the ISGCI database which represent the same graph class,
    for instance Perfect graphs and Berge graphs::

        sage: graph_classes.inclusion_digraph().is_directed_acyclic()
        False
        sage: Berge = graph_classes.get_class("gc_274"); Berge
        Berge graphs
        sage: Perfect = graph_classes.get_class("gc_56"); Perfect
        perfect graphs
        sage: Berge <= Perfect
        True
        sage: Perfect <= Berge
        True
        sage: Perfect == Berge
        True

Information for developpers
----------------------------

* The database is loaded not *so* large, but it is still preferable to
  only load it on demand. This is achieved through the cached methods
  :meth:`~sage.graphs.isgci.GraphClasses.classes` and
  :meth:`~sage.graphs.isgci.GraphClasses.inclusion_digraph`.

* Upon the first access to the database, the information is extracted
  from the XML file and stored in the cache of three methods:

  * ``sage.graphs.isgci._classes`` (dictionary)
  * ``sage.graphs.isgci._inclusions`` (list of dictionaries)
  * ``sage.graphs.isgci._inclusion_digraph`` (DiGraph)

  Note that the digraph is only built if necessary (for instance if
  the user tries to compare two classes).

.. todo::

    Technical things:

    * Query the database for non-inclusion results so that comparisons can
      return ``False``, and implement strict inclusions.

    * Implement a proper search method for the classes not listed in
      :obj:`graph_classes <GraphClasses>`

      .. seealso: :func:`sage.graphs.isgci.show_all`.

    * Some of the graph classes appearing in :obj:`graph_classes
      <GraphClasses>` already have a recognition
      algorithm implemented in Sage. It would be so nice to be able to
      write ``g in Trees``, ``g in Perfect``, ``g in Chordal``, ... :-)

    Long-term stuff:

    * Implement simple accessors for all the information in the ISGCI
      database (as can be done from the website)

    * Implement intersection of graph classes

    * Write generic recognition algorithms for specific classes (when a graph class
      is defined by the exclusion of subgraphs, one can write a generic algorithm
      checking the existence of each of the graphs, and this method already exists
      in Sage).

    * Improve the performance of Sage's graph library by letting it
      take advantage of the properties of graph classes. For example,
      :meth:`Graph.independent_set` could use the library to detect
      that a given graph is, say, a tree or a planar graph, and use a
      specialized algorithm for finding an independent set.
