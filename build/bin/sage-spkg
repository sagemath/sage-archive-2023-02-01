#
#  sage-spkg: install a Sage package
#
#  This script is typically invoked by giving the command
#      sage -i <options> <package name>...
#
#  Options can be:
#   -s: do not delete temporary build directory
#   -c: after installing, run the test suite for the spkg. This should
#       override the settings of SAGE_CHECK and SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES.
#   -d: only download the package
#
#  A package may assume that the following environment
#  variables are defined:
#
#      SAGE_ROOT      -- root directory of sage install
#      SAGE_LOCAL     -- $SAGE_ROOT/local
#      SAGE_DISTFILES -- directory that stores upstream tarballs
#      LIBRARY_PATH, PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
#      CC, CXX, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS, MAKE
#
#  Your package script should try to build using the giving CC, CXX,
#  CFLAGS, MAKE, etc, via a file spkg-install in your script.
#
#  This script does the following:
#
#      1. Set environment variables (by calling sage-env)
#      2. Extract the metadata and upstream sources into a build directory
#      3. Run the script in the package called spkg-install
#      4. Return error 1 if anything goes wrong.

Usage: sage -p <options> <package name>

If <package name> is a URL, download and install it. If it is a file
name, install it. Otherwise, search Sage's list of packages (see
'sage --package list') for a matching package, and if a match is
found, install it.

Options:
   -s: do not delete the temporary build directory
   -c: after installing, run the test suite for the package
   -d: only download the package

Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
