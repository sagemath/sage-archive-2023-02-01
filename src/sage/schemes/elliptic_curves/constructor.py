class EllipticCurveFactory(UniqueFactory):
    r"""
    Construct an elliptic curve.

    In Sage, an elliptic curve is always specified by
    (the coefficients of) a long Weierstrass equation

    .. MATH::

        y^2 + a_1 xy + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6.

    INPUT:

    There are several ways to construct an elliptic curve:

    - ``EllipticCurve([a1,a2,a3,a4,a6])``: Elliptic curve with given
      `a`-invariants. The invariants are coerced into a common parent.
      If all are integers, they are coerced into the rational numbers.

    - ``EllipticCurve([a4,a6])``: Same as above, but `a_1=a_2=a_3=0`.

    - ``EllipticCurve(label)``: Returns the elliptic curve over `\QQ`
      from the Cremona database with the given label. The label is a
      string, such as ``"11a"`` or ``"37b2"``. The letters in the
      label *must* be lower case (Cremona's new labeling).

    - ``EllipticCurve(R, [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6])``: Create the elliptic
      curve over `R` with given `a`-invariants. Here `R` can be an
      arbitrary commutative ring, although most functionality is only
      implemented over fields.

    - ``EllipticCurve(j=j0)`` or ``EllipticCurve_from_j(j0)``: Return
      an elliptic curve with `j`-invariant ``j0``.

    - ``EllipticCurve(polynomial)``: Read off the `a`-invariants from
      the polynomial coefficients, see
      :func:`EllipticCurve_from_Weierstrass_polynomial`.

    - ``EllipticCurve(cubic, point)``: The elliptic curve defined by a
      plane cubic (homogeneous polynomial in three variables), with a
      rational point.

    Instead of giving the coefficients as a *list* of length 2 or 5,
    one can also give a *tuple*.

    EXAMPLES:

    We illustrate creating elliptic curves::

        sage: EllipticCurve([0,0,1,-1,0])
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x over Rational Field

    We create a curve from a Cremona label::

        sage: EllipticCurve('37b2')
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 1873*x - 31833 over Rational Field
        sage: EllipticCurve('5077a')
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - 7*x + 6 over Rational Field
        sage: EllipticCurve('389a')
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 2*x over Rational Field

    Old Cremona labels are allowed::

        sage: EllipticCurve('2400FF')
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + 2*x + 8 over Rational Field

    Unicode labels are allowed::

        sage: EllipticCurve(u'389a')
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 2*x over Rational Field

    We create curves over a finite field as follows::

        sage: EllipticCurve([GF(5)(0),0,1,-1,0])
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + 4*x over Finite Field of size 5
        sage: EllipticCurve(GF(5), [0, 0,1,-1,0])
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + 4*x over Finite Field of size 5

    Elliptic curves over `\ZZ/N\ZZ` with `N` prime are of type
    "elliptic curve over a finite field"::

        sage: F = Zmod(101)
        sage: EllipticCurve(F, [2, 3])
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 over Ring of integers modulo 101
        sage: E = EllipticCurve([F(2), F(3)])
        sage: type(E)
        <class 'sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_finite_field.EllipticCurve_finite_field_with_category'>
        sage: E.category()
        Category of schemes over Ring of integers modulo 101

    In contrast, elliptic curves over `\ZZ/N\ZZ` with `N` composite
    are of type "generic elliptic curve"::

        sage: F = Zmod(95)
        sage: EllipticCurve(F, [2, 3])
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 over Ring of integers modulo 95
        sage: E = EllipticCurve([F(2), F(3)])
        sage: type(E)
        <class 'sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_generic.EllipticCurve_generic_with_category'>
        sage: E.category()
        Category of schemes over Ring of integers modulo 95

    The following is a curve over the complex numbers::

        sage: E = EllipticCurve(CC, [0,0,1,-1,0])
        sage: E
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 1.00000000000000*y = x^3 + (-1.00000000000000)*x over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
        sage: E.j_invariant()
        2988.97297297297

    We can also create elliptic curves by giving the Weierstrass equation::

        sage: R2.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
        sage: EllipticCurve(y^2 + y - ( x^3 + x - 9 ))
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + x - 9 over Rational Field

        sage: R.<x,y> = GF(5)[]
        sage: EllipticCurve(x^3 + x^2 + 2 - y^2 - y*x)
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y  = x^3 + x^2 + 2 over Finite Field of size 5

    We can also create elliptic curves by giving a smooth plane cubic with a rational point::

        sage: R3.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,3)
        sage: F = x^3+y^3+30*z^3
        sage: P = [1,-1,0]
        sage: EllipticCurve(F,P)
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 - 270*y = x^3 - 24300 over Rational Field

    We can explicitly specify the `j`-invariant::

        sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=1728); E; E.j_invariant(); E.label()
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - x over Rational Field
        1728
        '32a2'

        sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=GF(5)(2)); E; E.j_invariant()
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 over Finite Field of size 5
        2

    See :trac:`6657` ::

        sage: EllipticCurve(GF(144169),j=1728)
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Finite Field of size 144169

    Elliptic curves over the same ring with the same Weierstrass
    coefficients are identical, even when they are constructed in
    different ways (see :trac:`11474`)::

        sage: EllipticCurve('11a3') is EllipticCurve(QQ, [0, -1, 1, 0, 0])
        True

    By default, when a rational value of `j` is given, the constructed
    curve is a minimal twist (minimal conductor for curves with that
    `j`-invariant).  This can be changed by setting the optional
    parameter ``minimal_twist``, which is True by default, to False::

        sage: EllipticCurve(j=100)
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + 3392*x + 307888 over Rational Field
        sage: E =EllipticCurve(j=100); E
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + 3392*x + 307888 over Rational Field
        sage: E.conductor()
        33129800
        sage: E.j_invariant()
        100
        sage: E =EllipticCurve(j=100, minimal_twist=False); E
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 488400*x - 530076800 over Rational Field
        sage: E.conductor()
        298168200
        sage: E.j_invariant()
        100

    Without this option, constructing the curve could take a long time
    since both `j` and `j-1728` have to be factored to compute the
    minimal twist (see :trac:`13100`)::

       sage: E = EllipticCurve_from_j(2^256+1,minimal_twist=False)
       sage: E.j_invariant() == 2^256+1
       True

    TESTS::

        sage: R = ZZ['u', 'v']
        sage: EllipticCurve(R, [1,1])
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in u, v
        over Integer Ring

    We create a curve and a point over ``QQbar`` (see :trac:`6879`)::

        sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQbar,[0,1])
        sage: E(0)
        (0 : 1 : 0)
        sage: E.base_field()
        Algebraic Field

        sage: E = EllipticCurve(RR,[1,2]); E; E.base_field()
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1.00000000000000*x + 2.00000000000000 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
        Real Field with 53 bits of precision
        sage: EllipticCurve(CC,[3,4]); E; E.base_field()
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 3.00000000000000*x + 4.00000000000000 over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1.00000000000000*x + 2.00000000000000 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
        Real Field with 53 bits of precision
        sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQbar,[5,6]); E; E.base_field()
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 5*x + 6 over Algebraic Field
        Algebraic Field

    See :trac:`6657` ::

        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...

        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: First parameter must be a ring containing 3/5

    If the universe of the coefficients is a general field, the object
    constructed has type EllipticCurve_field.  Otherwise it is
    EllipticCurve_generic.  See :trac:`9816` ::

    def create_key_and_extra_args(self, x=None, y=None, j=None, minimal_twist=True, **kwds):
        """
        Return a ``UniqueFactory`` key and possibly extra parameters.

        INPUT:

        See the documentation for :class:`EllipticCurveFactory`.

        OUTPUT:

        A pair ``(key, extra_args)``:

        - ``key`` has the form `(R, (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6))`,
          representing a ring and the Weierstrass coefficients of an
          elliptic curve over that ring;

        - ``extra_args`` is a dictionary containing additional data to
          be inserted into the elliptic curve structure.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: EllipticCurve.create_key_and_extra_args(j=8000)
            ((Rational Field, (0, 1, 0, -3, 1)), {})

        When constructing a curve over `\\QQ` from a Cremona or LMFDB
        label, the invariants from the database are returned as
        ``extra_args``::

            sage: key, data = EllipticCurve.create_key_and_extra_args('389.a1')
            sage: key
            (Rational Field, (0, 1, 1, -2, 0))
            sage: data['conductor']
            389
            sage: data['cremona_label']
            '389a1'
            sage: data['lmfdb_label']
            '389.a1'
            sage: data['rank']
            2
            sage: data['torsion_order']
            1

        User-specified keywords are also included in ``extra_args``::

            sage: key, data = EllipticCurve.create_key_and_extra_args((0, 0, 1, -23737, 960366), rank=4)
            sage: data['rank']
            4

        Furthermore, keywords takes precedence over data from the
        database, which can be used to specify an alternative set of
        generators for the Mordell-Weil group::

            sage: key, data = EllipticCurve.create_key_and_extra_args('5077a1', gens=[[1, -1], [-2, 3], [4, -7]])
            sage: data['gens']
            [[1, -1], [-2, 3], [4, -7]]
            sage: E = EllipticCurve.create_object(0, key, **data)
            sage: E.gens()
            [(-2 : 3 : 1), (1 : -1 : 1), (4 : -7 : 1)]

        Note that elliptic curves are equal if and only they have the
        same base ring and Weierstrass equation; the data in
        ``extra_args`` do not influence comparison of elliptic curves.
        A consequence of this is that passing keyword arguments only
        works when constructing an elliptic curve the first time::

            sage: E = EllipticCurve('433a1', gens=[[-1, 1], [3, 4]])
            sage: E.gens()
            [(-1 : 1 : 1), (3 : 4 : 1)]
            sage: E = EllipticCurve('433a1', gens=[[-1, 0], [0, 1]])
            sage: E.gens()
            [(-1 : 1 : 1), (3 : 4 : 1)]

        .. WARNING::

            Manually specifying extra data is almost never necessary
            and is not guaranteed to have any effect, as the above
            example shows.  Almost no checking is done, so specifying
            incorrect data may lead to wrong results of computations
            instead of errors or warnings.

def EllipticCurve_from_cubic(F, P=None, morphism=True):
    r"""
    Construct an elliptic curve from a ternary cubic with a rational point.

    If you just want the Weierstrass form and are not interested in
    the morphism then it is easier to use the function
    :func:`~sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.jacobian.Jacobian`
    instead. If there is a rational point on the given cubic, this
    function will construct the same elliptic curve but you do not have to
    supply the point ``P``.

    INPUT:

    - ``F`` -- a homogeneous cubic in three variables with rational
      coefficients, as a polynomial ring element, defining a smooth
      plane cubic curve `C`.

    - ``P`` -- a 3-tuple `(x,y,z)` defining a projective point on `C`,
      or ``None``.  If ``None`` then a rational flex will be used as a
      base point if one exists, otherwise an error will be raised.

    - ``morphism`` -- boolean (default: ``True``).  If ``True``
      returns a birational isomorphism from `C` to a Weierstrass
      elliptic curve `E`, otherwise just returns `E`.

    OUTPUT:

    Either (when ``morphism``=``False``) an elliptic curve `E` in long
    Weierstrass form isomorphic to the plane cubic curve `C` defined
    by the equation `F=0`.

    Or (when ``morphism=True``), a birational isomorphism from `C` to
    the elliptic curve `E`. If the given point is a flex, this is a
    linear isomorphism.

    .. NOTE::

      The function
      :func:`~sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.jacobian.Jacobian` may be
      used instead.  It constructs the same elliptic curve (which is in
      all cases the Jacobian of `(F=0)`) and needs no base point to be
      provided, but also returns no isomorphism since in general there
      is none: the plane cubic is only isomorphic to its Jacobian when
      it has a rational point.

    .. NOTE::

       When ``morphism=True``, a birational isomorphism between the
       curve `F=0` and the Weierstrass curve is returned. If the point
       happens to be a flex, then this is a linear isomorphism.  The
       morphism does not necessarily take the given point `P` to the
       point at infinity on `E`, since we always use a rational flex
       on `C` as base-point when one exists.

    EXAMPLES:

    First we find that the Fermat cubic is isomorphic to the curve
    with Cremona label 27a1::

        sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
        sage: cubic = x^3+y^3+z^3
        sage: P = [1,-1,0]
        sage: E = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(cubic, P, morphism=False); E
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 - 9*y = x^3 - 27 over Rational Field
        sage: E.cremona_label()
        '27a1'
        sage: EllipticCurve_from_cubic(cubic, [0,1,-1], morphism=False).cremona_label()
        '27a1'
        sage: EllipticCurve_from_cubic(cubic, [1,0,-1], morphism=False).cremona_label()
        '27a1'

    Next we find the minimal model and conductor of the Jacobian of the
    Selmer curve::

        sage: R.<a,b,c> = QQ[]
        sage: cubic = a^3+b^3+60*c^3
        sage: P = [1,-1,0]
        sage: E = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(cubic, P, morphism=False);  E
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 - 540*y = x^3 - 97200 over Rational Field
        sage: E.minimal_model()
        Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 24300 over Rational Field
        sage: E.conductor()
        24300

    We can also get the birational isomorphism to and from the
    Weierstrass form. We start with an example where ``P`` is a flex
    and the equivalence is a linear isomorphism::

        sage: f = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(cubic, P, morphism=True)
        sage: f
        Scheme morphism:
          From: Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by a^3 + b^3 + 60*c^3
          To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 - 540*y = x^3 - 97200 over Rational Field
          Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (a : b : c) to
                (-c : 3*a : 1/180*a + 1/180*b)

        sage: finv = f.inverse();  finv
        Scheme morphism:
          From: Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 - 540*y = x^3 - 97200 over Rational Field
          To:   Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by a^3 + b^3 + 60*c^3
          Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
                (1/3*y : -1/3*y + 180*z : -x)

        Scheme morphism:
          From: Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 2*x*y + 20*y = x^3 - x^2 - 20*x - 400/3
                over Rational Field
          To:   Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field defined by:
          a^3 + b^3 + 60*c^3
          Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
                (x + y + 20*z : -x - y : -x)

    We verify that `f` maps the chosen point `P=(1,-1,0)` on the cubic
    to the origin of the elliptic curve::

        sage: f([1,-1,0])
        (0 : 1 : 0)
        sage: finv([0,1,0])
        (-1 : 1 : 0)

    To verify the output, we plug in the polynomials to check that
    this indeed transforms the cubic into Weierstrass form::

        sage: cubic(finv.defining_polynomials()) * finv.post_rescaling()
        -x^3 + y^2*z - 540*y*z^2 + 97200*z^3

        sage: E.defining_polynomial()(f.defining_polynomials()) * f.post_rescaling()
        a^3 + b^3 + 60*c^3

    If the given point is not a flex and the cubic has no rational
    flexes, then the cubic can not be transformed to a Weierstrass
    equation by a linear transformation. The general birational
    transformation is still a birational isomorphism, but is
    quadratic::

        sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
        sage: cubic = x^2*y + 4*x*y^2 + x^2*z + 8*x*y*z + 4*y^2*z + 9*x*z^2 + 9*y*z^2
        sage: f = EllipticCurve_from_cubic(cubic, [1,-1,1], morphism=True); f
        Scheme morphism:
          From: Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2*y + 4*x*y^2 + x^2*z + 8*x*y*z + 4*y^2*z + 9*x*z^2 + 9*y*z^2
          To:   Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 7560/19*x*y + 552960000000/2352637*y = x^3 - 3445200/133*x^2 over Rational Field
          Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y : z) to
                (2527/17280*x^2 + 133/2160*x*y + 133/108000*y^2 + 133/2880*x*z + 931/18000*y*z - 3857/48000*z^2 : -6859/288*x^2 + 323/36*x*y + 359/1800*y^2 + 551/48*x*z + 2813/300*y*z + 24389/800*z^2 : -2352637/99532800000*x^2 - 2352637/124416000000*x*y - 2352637/622080000000*y^2 + 2352637/82944000000*x*z + 2352637/207360000000*y*z - 2352637/276480000000*z^2)

    Note that the morphism returned cannot be evaluated directly at
    the given point ``P=(1:-1:1)`` since the polynomials defining it
    all vanish there::

        sage: f([1,-1,1])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: [0, 0, 0] does not define a valid point since all entries are 0

    Using the group law on the codomain elliptic curve, which has rank
    1 and full 2-torsion, and the inverse morphism, we can find many
    points on the cubic.  First we find the preimages of multiples of
    the generator::

        sage: E = f.codomain()
        sage: E.label()
        '720e2'
        sage: E.rank()
        1
        sage: R = E.gens()[0]; R

def EllipticCurves_with_good_reduction_outside_S(S=[], proof=None, verbose=False):
    r"""
    Return a sorted list of all elliptic curves defined over `Q`
    with good reduction outside the set `S` of primes.

    INPUT:

    -  ``S`` -- list of primes (default: empty list)

    - ``proof`` -- boolean (default ``True``): the MW basis for
      auxiliary curves will be computed with this proof flag

    - ``verbose`` -- boolean (default ``False``): if ``True``, some details
      of the computation will be output

    .. NOTE::

        Proof flag: The algorithm used requires determining all
        S-integral points on several auxiliary curves, which in turn
        requires the computation of their generators.  This is not
        always possible (even in theory) using current knowledge.

        The value of this flag is passed to the function which
        computes generators of various auxiliary elliptic curves, in
        order to find their S-integral points.  Set to ``False`` if the
        default (``True``) causes warning messages, but note that you can
        then not rely on the set of curves returned being
        complete.
