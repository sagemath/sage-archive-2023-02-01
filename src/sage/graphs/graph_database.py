r"""A collection of constructors of common graphs.USES:    A list of all graphs and graph structures in this database is
    available via tab completion. Type "graphs." and then hit tab to see
    which graphs are available.    The docstrings include educational information about each named graph
    with the hopes that this database can be used as a reference.PLOTTING:    All graphs (i.e., networks) have an associated SAGE graphics object,
    which you can display:                sage: G = WheelGraph(15)        sage: p = G.plot()        sage: is_Graphics(p)        True    When creating a graph in SAGE, the default positioning of nodes is
    determined using the spring-layout algorithm.  Often, it is more
    efficient to pre-set the positions in a dictionary.  Additionally, we
    can use this position dictionary to display the graph in an intuitive
    manner, whereas the spring-layout would fail if the graph is not very
    symmetric.  For example, consider the Petersen graph with default node
    positioning vs. the Petersen graph constructed by this database:        sage: petersen_spring = Graph({0:[1,4,5], 1:[0,2,6], 2:[1,3,7], 3:[2,4,8], 4:[0,3,9],\                5:[0,7,8], 6:[1,8,9], 7:[2,5,9], 8:[3,5,6], 9:[4,6,7]})        sage.: petersen_spring.show()        sage: petersen_database = graphs.PetersenGraph()        sage.: petersen_database.show()        For all the constructors in this database (except the random and
    empty graphs), the position dictionary is filled, instead of using the
    spring-layout algorithm.ORGANIZATION:    The constructors available in this database are organized as follows:    \begin{verbatim}        Basic Structures:            - EmptyGraph            - CycleGraph            - StarGraph            - WheelGraph        Named Graphs:            - PetersenGraph        Families of Graphs:            - CompleteGraph            - CompleteBipartiteGraph            - RandomGNP            - RandomGNPFast    \end{verbatim}AUTHORS:    -- Robert Miller (2006-11-05): initial version - empty, random,

        an n-gon.                This constructor is dependant on vertices numbered 0 through n-1

        the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, each cycle graph will
        be displayed with the first (0) node at the top, with the rest
        following in a counterclockwise manner.                The cycle graph is a good opportunity to compare efficiency of
        filling a position dictionary vs. using the spring-layout algorithm
        for plotting.  Because the cycle graph is very symmetric, the
        resulting plots should be similar (in cases of small n).                Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the
        constructor.  Feel free to race the constructors below in the
        examples section.  The much larger difference is the time added        by the spring-layout algorithm when plotting.  (Also shown in the

        the spring-layout algorithm vs. the position dictionary used in
        this constructor.  The position dictionary flattens the graph,
        making it clear which nodes an edge is connected to.  But the
        complete graph offers a good example of how the spring-layout
        works.  The edges push outward (everything is connected), causing
        the graph to appear as a 3-dimensional pointy ball.  (See examples
        below).                Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the

        by the spring-layout algorithm when plotting.  (Also shown in the

        nodes) is stretched to the same length as the longer row, unless
        the shorter row has 1 node; in which case it is centered.  The x

        using the spring-layout algorithm vs. the position dictionary used
        in this constructor.  The position dictionary flattens the graph
        and separates the partitioned nodes, making it clear which nodes
        an edge is connected to.  The Complete Bipartite graph plotted with
        the spring-layout algorithm tends to center the nodes in n1 (see
        spring_med in examples below), thus overlapping its nodes and edges,
        making it typically hard to decipher.                Filling the position dictionary in advance adds O(n) to the
