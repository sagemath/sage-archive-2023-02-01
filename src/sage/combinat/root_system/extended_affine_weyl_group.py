def ExtendedAffineWeylGroup(cartan_type, general_linear=None, **print_options):
    r"""
    The extended affine Weyl group.

    INPUT:

    - ``cartan_type`` -- An affine or finite Cartan type (a finite Cartan type is an
      abbreviation for its untwisted affinization)
    - ``general_linear`` -- (default: None) If True and ``cartan_type`` indicates
      untwisted type A, returns the universal central extension
    - ``print_options`` -- Special instructions for printing elements (see below)

    .. RUBRIC:: Mnemonics

    - "P" -- subgroup of translations
    - "Pv" -- subgroup of translations in a dual form
    - "W0" -- classical Weyl group
    - "W" -- affine Weyl group
    - "F" -- fundamental group of length zero elements

    There are currently six realizations: "PW0", "W0P, "WF", "FW", "PvW0", and "W0Pv".

    "PW0" means the semidirect product of "P" with "W0" acting from the right.
    "W0P" is similar but with "W0" acting from the left.
    "WF" is the semidirect product of "W" with "F" acting from the right, etc.

    Recognized arguments for ``print_options`` are:

    - ``print_tuple`` -- True or False (default: False) If True, elements are printed
      `(a,b)`, otherwise as `a * b`
    - ``affine`` -- Prefix for simple reflections in the affine Weyl group
    - ``classical`` -- Prefix for simple reflections in the classical Weyl group
    - ``translation`` -- Prefix for the translation elements
    - ``fundamental`` -- Prefix for the elements of the fundamental group

    These options are not mutable.

    The *extended affine Weyl group* was introduced in the following references.

    .. RUBRIC:: Notation

    - `R` -- An irreducible affine root system
    - `I` -- Set of nodes of the Dynkin diagram of `R`
    - `R_0` -- The classical subsystem of `R`
    - `I_0` -- Set of nodes of the Dynkin diagram of `R_0`
    - `E` -- Extended affine Weyl group of type `R`
    - `W` -- Affine Weyl group of type `R`

    - `P` -- Finite weight lattice
    - `Q` -- Finite root lattice
    - `P^\vee` -- Finite coweight lattice
    - `Q^\vee` -- Finite coroot lattice

    .. RUBRIC:: Translation lattices

    The styles "PW0" and "W0P" use the following lattices:

    - Untwisted affine: `L = P^\vee`, `M = Q^\vee`
    - Dual of untwisted affine: `L = P`, `M = Q`
    - `BC_n` (`A_{2n}^{(2)}`): `L = M = P`
    - Dual of `BC_n` (`A_{2n}^{(2)\dagger}`): `L = M = P^\vee`

    The styles "PvW0" and "W0Pv" use the following lattices:

    - Untwisted affine: The weight lattice of the dual finite Cartan type.
    - Dual untwisted affine: The same as for "PW0" and "W0P".

    For mixed affine type (`A_{2n}^{(2)}`, aka  `\tilde{BC}_n`, and their affine duals)
    the styles "PvW0" and "W0Pv" are not implemented.

    .. RUBRIC:: Finite and affine Weyl groups `W_0` and `W`

    The finite Weyl group `W_0` is generated by the simple reflections `s_i` for `i \in I_0` where
    `s_i` is the reflection across a suitable hyperplane `H_i` through the origin in the
    real span `V` of the lattice `M`.

    `R` specifies another (affine) hyperplane `H_0`. The affine Weyl group `W` is generated by `W_0`
    and the reflection `S_0` across `H_0`.

    .. RUBRIC:: Extended affine Weyl group `E`

    The complement in `V` of the set `H` of hyperplanes obtained from the `H_i` by the action of
    `W`, has connected components called alcoves. `W` acts freely and transitively on the set
    of alcoves. After the choice of a certain alcove (the fundamental alcove),
    there is an induced bijection from `W` to the set of alcoves under which the identity
    in `W` maps to the fundamental alcove.

    Then `L` is the largest sublattice of `V`, whose translations stabilize the set of alcoves.

    There are isomorphisms

    .. MATH::

        \begin{aligned}
        W &\cong M \rtimes W_0 \cong W_0 \ltimes M \\
        E &\cong L \rtimes W_0 \cong W_0 \ltimes L
        \end{aligned}

    .. RUBRIC:: Fundamental group of affine Dynkin automorphisms

    Since `L` acts on the set of alcoves, the group `F = L/M` may be viewed as a
    subgroup of the symmetries of the fundamental alcove or equivalently the
    symmetries of the affine Dynkin diagram.
    `F` acts on the set of alcoves and hence on `W`. Conjugation by an element of `F`
    acts on `W` by permuting the indices of simple reflections.

    There are isomorphisms

    .. MATH::

        E \cong F \ltimes W \cong W \rtimes F

    An affine Dynkin node is *special* if it is conjugate to the zero node under some
    affine Dynkin automorphism.

    There is a bijection `i` `\mapsto` `\pi_i` from the set of special nodes
    to the group `F`, where `\pi_i` is the unique element of `F` that sends `0` to `i`.
    When `L=P` (resp. `L=P^\vee`) the element `\pi_i` is induced
    (under the isomorphism `F \cong L/M`) by addition of the coset of the
    `i`-th fundamental weight (resp. coweight).

    The length function of the Coxeter group `W` may be extended to `E` by
    `\ell(w \pi) = \ell(w)` where `w \in W` and `\pi\in F`.
    This is the number of hyperplanes in `H` separating the
    fundamental alcove from its image by `w \pi` (or equivalently `w`).

    It is known that if `G` is the compact Lie group of adjoint type with root
    system `R_0` then `F` is isomorphic to the fundamental group of `G`, or
    to the center of its simply-connected covering group. That is why we
    call `F` the *fundamental group*.

    In the future we may want to build an element of the group from an appropriate linear map f
    on some of the root lattice realizations for this Cartan type: W.from_endomorphism(f).

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: E = ExtendedAffineWeylGroup(["A",2,1]); E
        Extended affine Weyl group of type ['A', 2, 1]
        sage: type(E)
        <class 'sage.combinat.root_system.extended_affine_weyl_group.ExtendedAffineWeylGroup_Class_with_category'>

        sage: PW0=E.PW0(); PW0
        Extended affine Weyl group of type ['A', 2, 1] realized by Semidirect product of Multiplicative form of Coweight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 2] acted upon by Weyl Group of type ['A', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the coweight lattice)

        sage: W0P = E.W0P(); W0P
        Extended affine Weyl group of type ['A', 2, 1] realized by Semidirect product of Weyl Group of type ['A', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the coweight lattice) acting on Multiplicative form of Coweight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 2]

        sage: PvW0 = E.PvW0(); PvW0
        Extended affine Weyl group of type ['A', 2, 1] realized by Semidirect product of Multiplicative form of Weight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 2] acted upon by Weyl Group of type ['A', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the weight lattice)

        sage: W0Pv = E.W0Pv(); W0Pv
        Extended affine Weyl group of type ['A', 2, 1] realized by Semidirect product of Weyl Group of type ['A', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the weight lattice) acting on Multiplicative form of Weight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 2]

        sage: WF = E.WF(); WF
        Extended affine Weyl group of type ['A', 2, 1] realized by Semidirect product of Weyl Group of type ['A', 2, 1] (as a matrix group acting on the root lattice) acted upon by Fundamental group of type ['A', 2, 1]

        sage: FW = E.FW(); FW
        Extended affine Weyl group of type ['A', 2, 1] realized by Semidirect product of Fundamental group of type ['A', 2, 1] acting on Weyl Group of type ['A', 2, 1] (as a matrix group acting on the root lattice)

    When the realizations are constructed from each other as above, there are built-in coercions between them. ::

        sage: F = E.fundamental_group()
        sage: x = WF.from_reduced_word([0,1,2]) * WF(F(2)); x
        S0*S1*S2 * pi[2]
        sage: FW(x)
        pi[2] * S1*S2*S0
        sage: W0P(x)
        s1*s2*s1 * t[-2*Lambdacheck[1] - Lambdacheck[2]]
        sage: PW0(x)
        t[Lambdacheck[1] + 2*Lambdacheck[2]] * s1*s2*s1
        sage: PvW0(x)
        t[Lambda[1] + 2*Lambda[2]] * s1*s2*s1

    The translation lattice and its distinguished basis are obtained from ``E``::

        sage: L = E.lattice(); L
        Coweight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 2]
        sage: b = E.lattice_basis(); b
        Finite family {1: Lambdacheck[1], 2: Lambdacheck[2]}

    Translation lattice elements can be coerced into any realization::

        sage: PW0(b[1]-b[2])
        t[Lambdacheck[1] - Lambdacheck[2]]
        sage: FW(b[1]-b[2])
        pi[2] * S0*S1

    The dual form of the translation lattice and its basis are similarly obtained::

        sage: Lv = E.dual_lattice(); Lv
        Weight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 2]
        sage: bv = E.dual_lattice_basis(); bv
        Finite family {1: Lambda[1], 2: Lambda[2]}
        sage: FW(bv[1]-bv[2])
        pi[2] * S0*S1

    The abstract fundamental group is accessed from ``E``::

        sage: F = E.fundamental_group(); F
        Fundamental group of type ['A', 2, 1]

    Its elements are indexed by the set of special nodes of the affine Dynkin diagram::

        sage: E.cartan_type().special_nodes()
        (0, 1, 2)
        sage: F.special_nodes()
        (0, 1, 2)
        sage: [F(i) for i in F.special_nodes()]
        [pi[0], pi[1], pi[2]]

    There is a coercion from the fundamental group into each realization::

        sage: F(2)
        pi[2]
        sage: WF(F(2))
        pi[2]
        sage: W0P(F(2))
        s2*s1 * t[-Lambdacheck[1]]
        sage: W0Pv(F(2))
        s2*s1 * t[-Lambda[1]]

    Using ``E`` one may access the classical and affine Weyl groups and their morphisms
    into each realization::

        sage: W0 = E.classical_weyl(); W0
        Weyl Group of type ['A', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the coweight lattice)
        sage: v = W0.from_reduced_word([1,2,1]); v
        s1*s2*s1
        sage: PW0(v)
        s1*s2*s1
        sage: WF(v)
        S1*S2*S1
        sage: W = E.affine_weyl(); W
        Weyl Group of type ['A', 2, 1] (as a matrix group acting on the root lattice)
        sage: w = W.from_reduced_word([2,1,0]); w
        S2*S1*S0
        sage: WF(w)
        S2*S1*S0
        sage: PW0(w)
        t[Lambdacheck[1] - 2*Lambdacheck[2]] * s1

    Note that for untwisted affine type, the dual form of the classical
    Weyl group is isomorphic to the usual one, but acts on a different
    lattice and is therefore different to sage::

        sage: W0v = E.dual_classical_weyl(); W0v
        Weyl Group of type ['A', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the weight lattice)
        sage: v = W0v.from_reduced_word([1,2])
        sage: x = PvW0(v); x
        s1*s2
        sage: y = PW0(v); y
        s1*s2
        sage: x.parent() == y.parent()
        False

    However, because there is a coercion from ``PvW0`` to ``PW0``,
    the elements ``x`` and ``y`` compare as equal::

        sage: x == y
        True

    An element can be created directly from a reduced word::

        sage: PW0.from_reduced_word([2,1,0])
        t[Lambdacheck[1] - 2*Lambdacheck[2]] * s1

    Here is a demonstration of the printing options::

        sage: E = ExtendedAffineWeylGroup(["A",2,1], affine="sx", classical="Sx",translation="x",fundamental="pix")
        sage: PW0 = E.PW0()
        sage: y = PW0(E.lattice_basis()[1])
        sage: y
        x[Lambdacheck[1]]
        sage: FW = E.FW()
        sage: FW(y)
        pix[1] * sx2*sx1
        sage: PW0.an_element()
        x[2*Lambdacheck[1] + 2*Lambdacheck[2]] * Sx1*Sx2

    .. TODO::

        - Implement a "slow" action of `E` on any affine root or weight lattice realization.
        - Implement the level `m` actions of `E` and `W` on the lattices of finite type.
        - Implement the relevant methods from the usual affine Weyl group
        - Implementation by matrices: style "M".
        - Use case: implement the Hecke algebra on top of this

    The semidirect product construction in sage currently only
    admits multiplicative groups. Therefore for the styles involving "P" and "Pv", one must
    convert the additive group of translations `L` into a multiplicative group by
    applying the :class:`sage.groups.group_exp.GroupExp` functor.

    .. RUBRIC:: The general linear case

    The general linear group is not semisimple. Sage can build its extended
    affine Weyl group::

        sage: E = ExtendedAffineWeylGroup(['A',2,1], general_linear=True); E
        Extended affine Weyl group of GL(3)

    If the Cartan type is ``['A', n-1, 1]`` and the parameter ``general_linear`` is not
    True, the extended affine Weyl group that is built will be for `SL_n`, not
    `GL_n`. But if ``general_linear`` is True, let `W_a` and `W_e` be the affine and
    extended affine Weyl groups. We make the following nonstandard definition: the
    extended affine Weyl group `W_e(GL_n)` is defined by

    .. MATH::

        W_e(GL_n) = P(GL_n) \rtimes W

    where `W` is the finite Weyl group (the symmetric group `S_n`) and `P(GL_n)` is the weight lattice
    of `GL_n`, which is usually identified with the lattice `\ZZ^n` of `n`-tuples of integers::

        sage: PW0 = E.PW0(); PW0
        Extended affine Weyl group of GL(3) realized by Semidirect product of Multiplicative form of Ambient space of the Root system of type ['A', 2] acted upon by Weyl Group of type ['A', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the ambient space)
        sage: PW0.an_element()
        t[(2, 2, 3)] * s1*s2

    There is an isomorphism

    .. MATH::

        W_e(GL_n) = \ZZ \ltimes W_a

    where the group of integers `\ZZ` (with generator `\pi`) acts on `W_a` by

    .. MATH::

        \pi\, s_i\, \pi^{-1} = s_{i+1}

    and the indices of the simple reflections are taken modulo `n`::

        sage: FW = E.FW(); FW
        Extended affine Weyl group of GL(3) realized by Semidirect product of Fundamental group of GL(3) acting on Weyl Group of type ['A', 2, 1] (as a matrix group acting on the root lattice)
        sage: FW.an_element()
        pi[5] * S0*S1*S2

    We regard `\ZZ` as the fundamental group of affine type `GL_n`::

        sage: F = E.fundamental_group(); F
        Fundamental group of GL(3)
        sage: F.special_nodes()
        Integer Ring

        sage: x = FW.from_fundamental(F(10)); x
        pi[10]
