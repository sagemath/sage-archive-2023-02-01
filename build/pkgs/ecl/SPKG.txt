= ECL  =

== Description ==

ECL is an implementation of the Common Lisp language as defined by the
ANSI X3J13 specification. The most relevant features:

 * A bytecodes compiler and interpreter.
 * Compiles Lisp also with any C/C++ compiler.
 * It can build standalone executables and libraries.
 * ASDF, Sockets, Gray streams, MOP, and other useful components.
 * Extremely portable.
 * A reasonable license.

ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Solaris and Windows, running on top of the Intel, Sparc, Alpha and
PowerPC processors. Porting to other architectures should be rather
easy.

== Changelog ==

=== ecl-10.2.1.p2 (David Kirkby, 30th July 2010) ===
  * #9643 Force ECL to disable assembly code on Solaris 10 as
    it does on OpenSolaris. The conditions for disabling
    assembly code were relaxed, so the release (Solaris 10
    or OpenSolaris) are now ignored.

=== ecl-10.2.1.p1 (Mitesh Patel, 11th July 2010) ===
  * Originally #9187, backported to 10.2.1:  Set an empty MAKEFLAGS
    variable before "make".  On OS X, at least, this fixes building
    multiple spkgs in parallel (cf. #8306).

=== ecl-10.2.1.p0 (David Kirkby, 11th July 2010) ===
  * #9474 Revert ECL back to version 10.2.1 (along with Maxima too)
    since some Maxima tests have failed on sage.math.
  * #8089 Add the configure option '--with-dffi=no' on
    OpenSolaris on the x86 processor. This disables assembly code.
    This was originally #8089, but is back-ported to 10.2.1
  * Delete temp files in /tmp, as they cause problems building
    ECL in a multi-user environment. This was originally
    #8951

=== ecl-10.2.1 (William Stein, 14 February 2010) ===
  * Upgrade to latest stable upstream release.

=== ecl-9.10.2-20091105cvs.p1 (William Stein, December 17, 2009) ===
  * Remove the encodings directory, since it contains potentially
    dangerous binary files.

=== ecl-9.10.2-20091105cvs.p0 (Mike Hansen, November 5, 2009) ===
  * Updated to the latest version of ECL.  This has a number of fixes
    in it, including the patch that was in patches/mach_dep.c.

=== ecl-9.8.4-20090913cvs.p3 (William Stein, Oct 14, 2009) ===
  * trac 7213 -- put * in right place in rm command to make
    sure ecl still works when sage is moved (properly delete old versions)

=== ecl-9.8.4-20090913cvs.p2 (William Stein, Oct 11, 2009) ===
  * trac 7186 -- make sure ecl still works when sage is moved

=== ecl-9.8.4-20090913cvs.p1 (William Stein, Sept 20th, 2009) ===
  * Make the name more canonical
  * Patch for boehm GC code to also work on OS X 10.6

=== ecl-9.8.4-cvs-13th-Sept-2009  (David Kirkby and Minh Van Nguyen, Sept 15th, 2009) ===
  * Download the latest CVS from the ECL web site, as version
    9.8.4 is ackknowledged by the main ECL developer it will not work
    on 64-bit OS X
  * Correct failure to build on OS X ticket #6883 This replaces
    ./configure --prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL --with-system-gmp --enable-boehm=system
    with
    ./configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL
    in spkg-install.
  * Changed use of FFLAGS to FCFLAGS in spkg-install.
  * Set ABI to 64 and Export it. Only needed for OS X, but
    ignored on other platforms.
  * Print variable names, to aid debugging.
  * Unset make, as it appears to break parallel builds.

=== ecl-9.8.4 (David Kirkby, August 20th, 2009) ===
  * Updated to the latest 9.8.4 release of ECL (#6564)
  * removed the unneeded directory msvc from src to save disk space
  * Removed the patches directory, as there are none.
  * Changed spkg-install so no patches are applied.
  * Improved spkg-install so some sanity checks of the
    compilers takes place.
  * Enable all warnings on gcc.
  * Build 64-bit if SAGE64 is set to 'yes'
  * Removed the 'unset MAKE' in install-spkg.
  * Allow debug information to be removed from file, if
    SAGE_DEBUG is set to 'no', 'false' or '0'
    By default, debugging information will be supplied.
  * Removed an automatic addition of -g on 64-bit ( -g
    will be enable by default.)
  * Set CXXFLAGS and FFLAGS to have -m64 for a 64-bit build
    (originally only CFLAGS was done, yet there are C++ and
    Fortran files too).
  * Removed -m64 from LDFLAGS - it is not needed and unportable.
  * Add a check that someone is not mixing the Sun and GNU
    compilers.
  * Remove all the special build instructions from this file,
    as we are not sure they are needed.
  * Changed dependancy note above from gmp to mpir.
  * Added my own name as a maintainer.

=== ecl-9.4.1 (Michael Abshoff, May 15th, 2009) ===
 * Initial version.
