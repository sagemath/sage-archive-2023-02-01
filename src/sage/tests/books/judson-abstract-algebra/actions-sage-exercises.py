any test failures here that need to be changed
as a result of changes accepted into Sage.  You
may edit/change this file in any sensible way, so
that development work may procede.  Your changes
may later be replaced by the authors of "Abstract

## To execute doctests in these files, run

## or
##   $ $SAGE_ROOT/sage -t <a-single-file>
##
## Replace -t by "-tp n" for parallel testing,
##   "-tp 0" will use a sensible number of threads
