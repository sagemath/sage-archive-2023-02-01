== Dependencies ==

 * Python

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * This is a svn checkout. Note that on MacIntel OSX one has to remove a number of files due to PIC issues. The problem will be fixed upstream.
 * pexpect-2.1 is shockingly slow for SAGE (especially in the notebook) and I can't figure out why.  So we're sticking with p
expect-2.0 for now (which works fine for us).
 * put a try/except around __del__, to get rid of lots of pointless warning messages.

=== pexpect-2.0.p3 (Michael Abshoff, Janury 8th, 2009) ===
 * further clean up SPKG.txt
 * add .hgignore

=== pexpect-2.0.p2 (William Stein, January 23rd, 2009) ===
 * created proper SPKG.txt
 * fixed bug in pexpect where it tried to run directories
