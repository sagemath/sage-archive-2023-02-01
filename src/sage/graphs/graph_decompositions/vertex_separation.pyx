Vertex separation

This module implements several algorithms to compute the vertex separation of a
digraph and the corresponding ordering of the vertices. It also implements tests
functions for evaluation the width of a linear ordering.

Given an ordering
`v_1,\cdots, v_n` of the vertices of `V(G)`, its *cost* is defined as:

.. MATH::

    c(v_1, ..., v_n) = \max_{1\leq i \leq n} c'(\{v_1, ..., v_i\})

Where

.. MATH::

    c'(S) = |N^+_G(S)\backslash S|

The *vertex separation* of a digraph `G` is equal to the minimum cost of an
ordering of its vertices.

**Vertex separation and pathwidth**

The vertex separation is defined on a digraph, but one can obtain from a graph
`G` a digraph `D` with the same vertex set, and in which each edge `uv` of `G`
is replaced by two edges `uv` and `vu` in `D`. The vertex separation of `D` is
equal to the pathwidth of `G`, and the corresponding ordering of the vertices of
`D`, also called a *layout*, encodes an optimal path-decomposition of `G`.
This is a result of Kinnersley [Kin92]_ and Bodlaender [Bod98]_.

Exponential algorithm for vertex separation
-------------------------------------------

In order to find an optimal ordering of the vertices for the vertex separation,
this algorithm tries to save time by computing the function `c'(S)` **at most
once** once for each of the sets `S\subseteq V(G)`. These values are stored in
an array of size `2^n` where reading the value of `c'(S)` or updating it can be
done in constant (and small) time.

Assuming that we can compute the cost of a set `S` and remember it, finding an
optimal ordering is an easy task. Indeed, we can think of the sequence `v_1,
..., v_n` of vertices as a sequence of *sets* `\{v_1\}, \{v_1,v_2\}, ...,
\{v_1,...,v_n\}`, whose cost is precisely `\max c'(\{v_1\}), c'(\{v_1,v_2\}),
... , c'(\{v_1,...,v_n\})`. Hence, when considering the digraph on the `2^n`
sets `S\subseteq V(G)` where there is an arc from `S` to `S'` if `S'=S\cap
\{v\}` for some `v` (that is, if the sets `S` and `S'` can be consecutive in a
sequence), an ordering of the vertices of `G` corresponds to a *path* from
`\emptyset` to `\{v_1,...,v_n\}`. In this setting, checking whether there exists
a ordering of cost less than `k` can be achieved by checking whether there
exists a directed path `\emptyset` to `\{v_1,...,v_n\}` using only sets of cost
less than `k`. This is just a depth-first-search, for each `k`.

**Lazy evaluation of** `c'`

In the previous algorithm, most of the time is actually spent on the computation
of `c'(S)` for each set `S\subseteq V(G)` -- i.e. `2^n` computations of
neighborhoods. This can be seen as a huge waste of time when noticing that it is
useless to know that the value `c'(S)` for a set `S` is less than `k` if all the
paths leading to `S` have a cost greater than `k`. For this reason, the value of
`c'(S)` is computed lazily during the depth-first search. Explanation :

When the depth-first search discovers a set of size less than `k`, the costs of
its out-neighbors (the potential sets that could follow it in the optimal
ordering) are evaluated. When an out-neighbor is found that has a cost smaller
than `k`, the depth-first search continues with this set, which is explored with
the hope that it could lead to a path toward `\{v_1,...,v_n\}`. On the other
hand, if an out-neighbour has a cost larger than `k` it is useless to attempt to
build a cheap sequence going though this set, and the exploration stops
there. This way, a large number of sets will never be evaluated and *a lot* of
computational time is saved this way.

Besides, some improvement is also made by "improving" the values found by
`c'`. Indeed, `c'(S)` is a lower bound on the cost of a sequence containing the
set `S`, but if all out-neighbors of `S` have a cost of `c'(S) + 5` then one
knows that having `S` in a sequence means a total cost of at least `c'(S) +
5`. For this reason, for each set `S` we store the value of `c'(S)`, and replace
it by `\max (c'(S), \min_{\text{next}})` (where `\min_{\text{next}}` is the
minimum of the costs of the out-neighbors of `S`) once the costs of these
out-neighbors have been evaluated by the algrithm.

.. NOTE::

    Because of its current implementation, this algorithm only works on graphs
    on less than 32 vertices. This can be changed to 64 if necessary, but 32
    vertices already require 4GB of memory. Running it on 64 bits is not
    expected to be doable by the computers of the next decade `:-D`

**Lower bound on the vertex separation**

One can obtain a lower bound on the vertex separation of a graph in exponential
time but *small* memory by computing once the cost of each set `S`. Indeed, the
cost of a sequence `v_1, ..., v_n` corresponding to sets `\{v_1\}, \{v_1,v_2\},
..., \{v_1,...,v_n\}` is

.. MATH::

    \max c'(\{v_1\}),c'(\{v_1,v_2\}),...,c'(\{v_1,...,v_n\})\geq\max c'_1,...,c'_n

where `c_i` is the minimum cost of a set `S` on `i` vertices. Evaluating the
`c_i` can take time (and in particular more than the previous exact algorithm),
but it does not need much memory to run.


MILP formulation for the vertex separation
------------------------------------------

We describe below a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for determining an
optimal layout for the vertex separation of `G`, which is an improved version of
the formulation proposed in [SP10]_. It aims at building a sequence `S_t` of
sets such that an ordering `v_1, ..., v_n` of the vertices correspond to
`S_0=\{v_1\}, S_2=\{v_1,v_2\}, ..., S_{n-1}=\{v_1,...,v_n\}`.

**Variables:**


- `y_v^t` -- Variable set to 1 if `v\in S_t`, and 0 otherwise. The order of
  `v` in the layout is the smallest `t` such that `y_v^t==1`.

- `u_v^t` -- Variable set to 1 if `v\not \in S_t` and `v` has an in-neighbor in
  `S_t`. It is set to 0 otherwise.

- `x_v^t` -- Variable set to 1 if either `v\in S_t` or if `v` has an in-neighbor
  in `S_t`. It is set to 0 otherwise.

- `z` -- Objective value to minimize. It is equal to the maximum over all step
  `t` of the number of vertices such that `u_v^t==1`.

**MILP formulation:**

.. MATH::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{alignat}{2}
    \text{Minimize:}
    &z&\\
    \text{Such that:}
    x_v^t &\leq x_v^{t+1}& \forall v\in V,\ 0\leq t\leq n-2\\
    y_v^t &\leq y_v^{t+1}& \forall v\in V,\ 0\leq t\leq n-2\\
    y_v^t &\leq x_w^t& \forall v\in V,\ \forall w\in N^+(v),\ 0\leq t\leq n-1\\
    \sum_{v \in V} y_v^{t} &= t+1& 0\leq t\leq n-1\\
    x_v^t-y_v^t&\leq u_v^t & \forall v \in V,\ 0\leq t\leq n-1\\
    \sum_{v \in V} u_v^t &\leq z& 0\leq t\leq n-1\\
    0 \leq x_v^t &\leq 1& \forall v\in V,\ 0\leq t\leq n-1\\
    0 \leq u_v^t &\leq 1& \forall v\in V,\ 0\leq t\leq n-1\\
    y_v^t &\in \{0,1\}& \forall v\in V,\ 0\leq t\leq n-1\\
    0 \leq z &\leq n&
    \end{alignat}

The vertex separation of `G` is given by the value of `z`, and the order of
vertex `v` in the optimal layout is given by the smallest `t` for which
`y_v^t==1`.


Branch and Bound algorithm for the vertex separation
----------------------------------------------------

We describe below the principle of a branch and bound algorithm (BAB) for
determining an optimal ordering for the vertex separation of `G`, as proposed in
[CMN14]_.

**Greedy steps:**

Let us denote `{\cal L}(S)` the set of all possible orderings of the vertices in
`S`, and let `{\cal L}_P(S)\subseteq {\cal L}(S)` be the orderings starting with
a prefix `P`. Let also `c(L)` be the cost of the ordering `L\in{\cal L}(V)` as
defined above.

Given a digraph `D=(V,A)`, a set `S\subset V`, and a prefix `P`, it has been
proved in [CMN14]_ that `\min_{L\in{\cal L}_P(V)} c(L) = \min_{L\in{\cal
L}_{P+v}(V)} c(L)` holds in two (non exhaustive) cases:

.. MATH::

    \text{or} \begin{cases}
    N^+(v)\subseteq S\cup N^+(S)\\
    v\in N^+(S)\text{ and }N^+(v)\setminus(S\cup N^+(S)) = \{w\}
    \end{cases}

In other words, if we find a vertex `v` satisfying the above conditions, the best
possible ordering with prefix `P` has the same cost as the best possible
ordering with prefix `P+v`. So we can greedily extend the prefix with vertices
satisfying the conditions which results in a significant reduction of the search
space.


**The algorithm:**

Given the current prefix `P` and the current upper bound `UB` (either an input
upper bound or the cost of the best solution found so far), apply the following
steps:

- Extend the prefix `P` into a prefix `P'` using the greedy steps as described
  above.

- Sort the vertices `v\in V\setminus P'` by increasing values of `|N^+(P+v)|`,
  and prune the vertices with a value larger or equal to `UB`. Let `\Delta` be
  the resulting sorted list.

- Repeat with prefix `P'+v` for all `v\in\Delta` and keep the best found
  solution.

If a lower bound is passed to the algorithm, it will stop as soon as a solution
with cost equal to that lower bound is found.


**Storing prefixes:**

If for a prefix `P` we have `c(P)<\min_{L\in{\cal L}_P(V)} c(L)=C`, then for any
permutation `P'` of `P` we have `\min_{L\in{\cal L}_{P'}(V)} c(L)\geq C`.

Thus, given such a prefix `P` there is no need to explore any of the orderings
starting with one of its permutations. To do so, we store `P` (as a set of
vertices) to cut branches later. See [CMN14]_ for more details.

Since the number of stored sets can get very large, one can control the maximum
length and the maximum number of stored prefixes.

    r"""
    Computes the vertex separation of `G` and the optimal ordering of its
    vertices using an MILP formulation.

    This function uses a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for determining an
    optimal layout for the vertex separation of `G`. This MILP is an improved
    version of the formulation proposed in [SP10]_. See the :mod:`module's
    documentation <sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation>` for more
    details on this MILP formulation.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a Graph or a DiGraph

    - ``integrality`` -- (default: ``False``) Specify if variables `x_v^t` and
      `u_v^t` must be integral or if they can be relaxed. This has no impact on
      the validity of the solution, but it is sometimes faster to solve the
      problem using binary variables only.

    - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP) solver to
      be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For more information
      on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see the method
      :meth:`solve<sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the
      class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram<sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of verbosity. Set
      to 0 by default, which means quiet.

    OUTPUT:

    A pair ``(cost, ordering)`` representing the optimal ordering of the

    Branch and Bound algorithm for the vertex separation.

    This method implements the branch and bound algorithm for the vertex
    separation of directed graphs and the pathwidth of undirected graphs
    proposed in [CMN14]_. The implementation is valid for both Graph and
    DiGraph. See the documentation of the
    :mod:`~sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation` module.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a Graph or a DiGraph.

    - ``cut_off`` -- (default: None) bound to consider in the branch and  bound
      algorithm. This allows us to stop the search as soon as a solution with
      width at most ``cut_off`` is found, if any. If this bound cannot be
      reached, the best solution found is returned, unless a too low
      ``upper_bound`` is given.

    - ``upper_bound`` -- (default: None) if specified, the algorithm searches
      for a solution with ``width < upper_bound``. It helps cutting branches.
      However, if the given upper bound is too low, the algorithm may not be
      able to find a solution.

    - ``max_prefix_length`` -- (default: 20) limits the length of the stored
      prefixes to prevent storing too many prefixes.

    - ``max_prefix_number`` -- (default: 10**6) upper bound on the number of
      stored prefixes used to prevent using too much memory.

    - ``verbose`` -- (default: False) display some information when set to True.

    OUTPUT:

    - ``width`` -- the computed vertex separation

    - ``seq`` -- an ordering of the vertices of width ``width``.

    - ``prefix`` -- array of ``n`` integers containing a permutation of the
      vertices. The vertices forming the current prefix under consideration are
      stored in cells ``[0,level-1]``.

    - ``positions`` -- array of ``n`` integers associating to each vertex its
      index in array ``prefix``.

    - ``best_seq`` -- array of ``n`` integers storing the best ordering found so
      far.

    - ``level`` -- an integer specifying the length of the current prefix.

    - ``b_prefix`` -- a bitset of size ``n`` recording the vertices in the
      current prefix (in cells ``[0,level-1]``).

    - ``b_prefix_and_neighborhood`` -- a bitset of size ``n`` recording the
