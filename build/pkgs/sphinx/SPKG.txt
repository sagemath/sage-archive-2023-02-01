== Description ==

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and
beautiful documentation for Python projects (or other documents
consisting of multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg
Brandl. It was originally created to translate the new Python
documentation, but has now been cleaned up in the hope that it will be
useful to many other projects.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Make sure to update the Sphinx version number in the file
   patches/sphinx-build.

 * Here is a description of patches on top of Sphinx 1.1.2:

   - patches/autodoc.patch: This patches
     src/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py. This adds an option to Sphinx to
     provide a function to get the argspecs of built-in functions.

   - patches/environment.patch: This patches the file
     src/sphinx/environment.py.  Patching it should prevent Sphinx
     from rebuilding documentation that is already built.

   - patches/highlighting.patch: This patches the file
     src/sphinx/highlighting.py. The patch should allow Sphinx to
     recognize the Sage prompt "sage:" the same way it recognizes the
     ">>>" from Python.

   - patches/pngmath.patch: This replaces \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
     by \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} in the LaTeX preamble for building
     images in the HTML documentation.  This change is done because
     some LaTeX installations have only utf8, not utf8x (utf8x adds
     support for much more Unicode characters, but these are not
     needed to typeset the mathematics in the Sage documentation).

   - patches/Makefile.patch: This patches the file
     src/sphinx/texinputs/Makefile to increase the save size stack to
     50,000 and increase the pool size stack to 4,000,000. These
     increased stack sizes should be sufficient for LaTeX to handle
     the huge index of the Sage reference manual when building the PDF
     version of that manual.

   - patches/nested.patch (submitted upstream: pull request #250, issue #777):
     This changes the sphinx's customized Verbatim environment to use
     \trivlist instead of \list. This fixes the pdf docbuild for
     deeply nested classes/methods revealed in #9107.

 * The script create_grammar_pickle.py creates the file
   Grammar2.7.pickle in site-packages/Sphinx-.../sphinx/pycode/.  This
   helps to avoid race conditions when building the documentation in
   parallel.

 * To do: autogenerate the file sage_autodoc.py from
   src/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py.  sage_autodoc.py is currently in
   SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common and is tracked in the Sage library
   repository, and as a result, it is now somewhat out-of-synch with
   autodoc.py.  Instead we could do the following: in spkg-install,

     cp sphinx/ext/autodoc.py sphinx/ext/sage_autodoc.py

   Then patch sage_autodoc.py in place.  This would require modifying
   devel/sage/doc/common/conf.py: 'extensions' would use
   'sphinx.ext.sage_autodoc' instead of 'sage_autodoc'.
