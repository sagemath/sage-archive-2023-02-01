# --verbose          : Display the output when running setup.py.
# --no-index         : Don't look at the package index.
# --disable-pip-version-check : Disables pip's version self-check.
# --isolated         : Don't read configuration files such as
#                      ~/.pydistutils.cfg
# --no-cache-dir     : Disable the cache.
#                      (so that no previously built wheels can sneak in to
#                      resolve runtime dependencies)

# Note: "sage-pip-install" is meant to be run after $(PYTHON) has
# been installed (either as an spkg or as a venv over a system python3).
# It is then guaranteed by sage-env that PATH is set in a way that "python3"
# refers to the correct python3.
#
# All SPKGs that use this script must therefore declare $(PYTHON) as a
# dependency.

# is prone to race conditions. Therefore, we use a lockfile while
# running pip. This is implemented in the Python script sage-flock

# to apply a shared lock)
