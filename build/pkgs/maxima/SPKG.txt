= Maxima =

== Description ==

Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical
expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series,
Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear
equations, polynomials, and sets, lists, vectors, matrices, and
tensors. Maxima yields high precision numeric results by using exact
fractions, arbitrary precision integers, and variable precision
floating point numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in two and
three dimensions.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

1. Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/Maxima-source/
   and download the source tarball maxima-x.y.z.tar.gz.

2. Extract the tarball.

3. In the directory maxima-x.y.z, run the spkg-src script.

4. Compress the directory into a new file maxima-x.y.z.tar.bz2 and
   place it in the upstream/ directory.

5. Make sure the patches still apply cleanly, and update them if
   necessary.

6. Test the resulting package.

Here's what spkg-src does:

 * Removes the unneeded PDF figures from the documentation.

 * Removes the foreign language versions of the info files.

The following patches are applied:

 * 0001-taylor2-Avoid-blowing-the-stack-when-diff-expand-isn.patch:
   Fix for Maxima bug #2520 (abs_integrate fails on abs(sin(x)) and
   abs(cos(x))).  Introduced in Trac #13364 (Upgrade Maxima to
   5.29.1).

 * build-fasl.patch: Build a fasl library for ecl in addition to an
   executable program.  Introduced in Trac #16178 (Build maxima fasl
   without asdf).

 * infodir.patch: Correct the path to the Info directory.

 * matrixexp.patch: Fix matrixexp(matrix([%i*%pi])), which broke after
   Maxima 5.29.1.  Introduced in Trac #13973.

 * maxima_bug_2526.patch: Fix for Maxima bug #2526 (abs_integrate
   fails on integrate(sqrt(x + sqrt(x)), x)).  Introduced in Trac
   #13364 (Upgrade Maxima to 5.29.1).

 * maxima.system.patch: Set c::*compile-in-constants* to t.

 * undoing_true_false_printing_patch.patch: Revert an upstream change
   causing '?' to be printed around some words.  Introduced in Trac
   #13364 (Upgrade Maxima to 5.29.1).
