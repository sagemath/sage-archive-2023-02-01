== Description ==

From http://mpfr.org/: The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision
floating-point computations with correct rounding. MPFR has continuously been
supported by the INRIA and the current main authors come from the CACAO and
Arenaire project-teams at Loria (Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France)
respectively; see more on the credit page. MPFR is based on the GMP
multiple-precision library.

 * integrate r5186 from trunk at http://gforge.inria.fr/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/?root=mpfr - This fixes an issue in mpfr where it would use alloca instead of the allocation function provided by GMP (which theses days is anything but alloca() due to limited stack on most system.
