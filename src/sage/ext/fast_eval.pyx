Fast Numerical Evaluation

For many applications such as numerical integration, differential
equation approximation, plotting a 3d surface, optimization problems,
monte-carlo simulations, etc., one wishes to pass around and evaluate
a single algebraic expression many, many times at various floating
point values. Doing this via recursive calls over a python
representation of the object (even if Maxima or other outside packages
are not involved) is extremely inefficient.

The solution implemented in this module, by Robert Bradshaw (2008-10),
has been superseded by :func:`~sage.ext.fast_callable.fast_callable`.
All that remains here is a compatible interface function :func:`fast_float`.

def fast_float(f, *vars, old=None, expect_one_var=False):
    """
    Tries to create a function that evaluates f quickly using
    floating-point numbers, if possible.  There are two implementations
    of fast_float in Sage; by default we use the newer, which is
    slightly faster on most tests.

    On failure, returns the input unchanged.

    INPUT:

    - ``f``    -- an expression
    - ``vars`` -- the names of the arguments
    - ``old``  -- deprecated, do not use
    - ``expect_one_var`` -- don't give deprecation warning if ``vars`` is
      omitted, as long as expression has only one var

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.ext.fast_eval import fast_float
        sage: x,y = var('x,y')
        sage: f = fast_float(sqrt(x^2+y^2), 'x', 'y')
        sage: f(3,4)
        5.0

    Specifying the argument names is essential, as fast_float objects
    only distinguish between arguments by order. ::

        sage: f = fast_float(x-y, 'x','y')
        sage: f(1,2)
        -1.0
        sage: f = fast_float(x-y, 'y','x')
        sage: f(1,2)
        1.0
