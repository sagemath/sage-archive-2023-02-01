[] some "magic":
     - time command ?? check if "time" is a valid identifier using var
       list, and if not then give the time.
 done    - attach   # will work from DIR if not abs path.
 done    - load     # will work from DIR if not abs path.
 done    - save_session -- saves to objects dir

     - %gp: at the top of a block and it gets executed in pari.

[] i need to rethink the design of having multiple workbooks at once:
    possibilities:
        xx have multiple workbook div's all in the html, each
           with an id.  have a way to "close" a workbook, i.e.,
           button in upper right (Maybe a close link like the Help, etc. links).
           the update function has to tell about *all* the workbooks
           rather than just one:
               update contains:
                    number of workbooks with data
                    workbook number <data>  ...
                    workbook number <data>  ...
               and the workbook data will allow us to set the color
               on the the workbooks tab on the left.

[] variables: easy way to save any variable to a var with the same name
   in the common saved objects store.

[] click on saved object or variable and get a download ?

[] todo: make the saved state file backup the last safe state, to
   avoid the potential for corruption if the server Python process is
   killed while saving state.  Also, this could easily allow for a
   sophisticated undo function; design ideas welcome...

[] print -- javascript button, which displays the whole page as one page
   (no scrolling, etc.), etc., and calls print.

[] latex -- support for embedding in output?, e.g.,
        view(x)
   embeds latex repn.

[] HTML cells in addition to SAGE code cells; or just better typesetting
   support and way to hide the input (!)

[] Workbooks:
    (all html downloaded at once; so switching done entirely in js)
     -- new
     -- switching
     -- deleting

[] workbooks list -- could have status information, e.g.,
   if a comp is running, could make the entry redish until
   it is done.


IDEAS:

[] easy user override of css elements.

[] should be able to download/upload complete workbooks as a single file
   and move them in/out of other notebooks.  How?
     1. an sobj defines the workbook, and a tarball the data and graphs,
        so tarball it up with the sobj.
     2. interface -- when you mouse over a workbook, a menu appears with
        the option to download it to a file.
     3. Also, there's an upload link in the workbooks list.

[] good support for a "presentation" mode.

[] Markup mode?:
   If the input box begins in %html then the output is in html instead
   of plain text, and the input box gets shrunk.  This would allow for
   sophisticated markup.

[] favicon

[] os.sytem('pydoc -k <...>')  -- interesting

[] debugger -- some way to enter pdb and use it from web interface

[] when eval: always insert a new cell after the current one???
     mathematica does *not* do this, but word processors do.

[] save all objects in a session to a single variable:
     - a button in the variables pane -- asks for var name.
       OR drag variables pane to workbooks (?).


OLD TODO:
   [] restart (with confirm) button -- lets you restart the
      client SAGE interpreter that is being run by the web server.
      This way you don't have to keep restarting the web server
      when doing code development.  Have button that can also
      save session, restart, and load session!
(not needed)
   [] ability to select any subset of the cells, e.g., by
      checking on a button next to each or something and do
      each of the following ops:
          delete them
          export them as another workbook
      Also, should be able to insert a workbook between two cells.
      Basically, copy, paste, and delete with bits of workbooks.
      Should also be able to reorganize them.
(not really needed)
   [x] way to time how long a computation takes.
   [x] word wrap -- default on, but toggle on/off on a cell-by-cell basis
      (will require ajax to do the wrapped/non-wrapped computation, or
      store both versions in the html... so will work offline)
   [x] input one form shouldn't delete data from any other forms;
       e.g., you could be editing one form and submit another!
   [x] The whole interface needs to be slimmed down so bunches of single
      line input (and output) will work.
   [] Ability to switch from one log (=workbook) to another via
      the web interface.
   [] Add text annotation that is not evaluated
      between blocks (maybe in html?)
   [] Ability to interrupt running calculations directly
      from the web interface (no console access)
   [] Nice animation while a computation is proceeding.
   [] Some way to show output as it is computed.
   [] Option to delete blocks
   [] Make block expand if enter a lot of text into it.
   [] Evaluate the entire worksheet
   [] Theme-able / skin-able
   [] Downloading and access to exact log of IO to client SAGE process
   [] Saving and loading of all objects in a session
   [] Save session objects as to log objects so don't have to re-eval?
   [] The entire page is resent/updated every time you hit shift-enter;
      using 'AJAX' this flicker/lag could be completely eliminated.
   [] When pressing shift-enter a line feed is inserted temporarily
      into the inbox, which is unnerving.
   [] Add authentication
   [] Embed the log object in the html file, so server session
      can be restared directly using the html file!  E.g., embed
      pickled Log object in a comment at end of the .html file.
   [] Ability to upload and download source files (to be run)
      via web interface; maybe ability to edit them too, via some
      'rich' code editing javascript 'widget'.
   [] rewrite tables using CSS
   [] load and attaching scripts.
   [] a way to interactively watch the output of a running computation
      (in verbose mode).
   [] undo -- have infinite undo and redo of the SAGE *log*, i.e.,
      text I/O (and possibly graphics).  does not save *state* of
      the "sage kernel".
   [] switch into mode where the whole input box is parsed by
      another system, e.g., Maxima.

DONE
   [x] Saving and loading of individual objects: -- should be trivial,
       but is very tedious right now.
       (maybe all relative paths for save/load should be redirected
        to sage_server directory?!)
   [x] The "move to the current input box" javascript *only* works
      with firefox (not opera, not konqueror); also this should
      just keep the page position where it is rather than move it.
      Moving to a more AJAX-ish model would alternatively fix this, maybe.
   [x] A. Clemesha: shrink/expand input/output blocks
   [x] A. Clemesha: When hit shift-enter the next text box should be made
      into focus.
   [x] Embedded graphics from plots;
       also embed png from latexing of math objects (so they look nice).


DONE:
[x] Manipulating cell list:
     -- add new cell (automatic at end)
     -- add cell between two existing cells
     -- delete cell

[x] Saved objects:
     -- info: load/save

[x] SAGE restart (with confirmation alert)

[x] interrupt -- should add (interrupted) to top of all output

[x] interrupt -- red only when comp running!!

[x] Fix worksheet area so it doesn't scroll horizontally

[x] Separate the variables / scripts panes from the workbooks / objects panes.

[x] Variables:
     -- info:
     -- change typeface of "type" of variable, e.g., in parens and dimmer,
        but variable name in bold.

[x] Introspection:
      Tab completion / search / help -- bring in from before.

[x] bug: when backspace away a cell, get taken to next -- should get taken to previous.

[x] another idea:
     where to comps get run?  they could all be run from
     an explicitly given directory when the notebook is
     started.  Then new files are copied to their cell
     directories.    another possibility:
       define a variable "HOME" in all sage0's,
       which is the directory
       from which SAGE was started.   Then users
       can load by using HOME + ...


[x] fix variables pane

[x] support for .sage/init.sage

[x] '\n' alone on a line breaks it.  If it isn't the last line it's ok.

[x] preparser fix -- triple quoted strings in middle of loaded files should be ignored

[x] Scripts: way to load/attach via web interface.
