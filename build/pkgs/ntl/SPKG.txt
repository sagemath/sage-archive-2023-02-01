5.4.1.p1 is an artificial increment to force a rebuild.


I had to create some extra lines for the Makefile in
order to build a dynamic library.    The trickiest
was the one for OS X.

It's *crucial* that NTL be built as a dynamic library; otherwise
SAGE loads multiple huge copies of NTL, and the code, e.g., to
set the modulus only sets the modulus for *it's* local copy
of ntl.  Perhaps I should put all my pyrex ntl code together
into one module so building dynamic isn't necessary...?

---------

Some notes about finding the ntl bug:

  (1) The NTL build failed to correctly create a "libntl.dylib"
      dynamic library for NTL, and instead made only a "libntl.a"
      library.  This didn't result in a sufficiently strong error
      message to halt the SAGE build process.

  (2) When SAGE built the NTL modules it linked in a completely
      separate copy of libntl with each module.  This didn't result
      in errors, because libntl.a was successfully built.

  (3) The SAGE code for setting the NTL modulus is in a different
      Python module than the code for creating polynomials over finite
      fields.  When SAGE ran it thus had, in some sense, several copies
      of the NTL library in memory at once.  The set modulus function
      changed one copy while the the "make a polynomial" function
      changed another.  The result was the bug we saw.

On Solaris I have to use

libntl.so: $(OBJ)
	$(CXX) -G -h  -o libntl.so $(OBJ)
