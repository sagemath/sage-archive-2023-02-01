class Profiler:
    r"""
    Keeps track of CPU time used between a series of user-defined checkpoints.

    It's probably not a good idea to use this class in an inner loop :-)

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: def f():                        # not tested
        ....:     p = Profiler()              # not tested

    Calling ``p(message)`` creates a checkpoint::

        sage: p("try factoring 15")           # not tested

    Do something time-consuming::

        sage: x = factor(15)                  # not tested

    You can create a checkpoints without a string; ``Profiler``
    will use the source code instead::

        sage: p()                             # not tested
        sage: y = factor(25)                  # not tested
        sage: p("last step")                  # not tested
        sage: z = factor(35)                  # not tested
        sage: p()                             # not tested

    This will give a nice list of timings between checkpoints::

        sage: print(p)                        # not tested

    Let's try it out::

        sage: f()                             # not tested
            3.020s -- try factoring 15
           15.240s -- line 17: y = factor(25)
         5000.190s -- last step

    .. SEEALSO:: :func:`runsnake`

    .. todo::

        - Add Pyrex source code inspection (I assume it doesn't
          currently do this)
        - Add ability to sort output by time
        - Add option to constructor to print timing immediately when
          checkpoint is reached
        - Migrate to Pyrex?
        - Add ability to return timings in a more machine-friendly
          format
