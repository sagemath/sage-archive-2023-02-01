Welcome to the Sage Developer's Guide!
==================================================

Sage is a free mathematics software system. It is implemented using
Python, Cython, and C++, uses GAP, GSL, Matplotlib, Maxima, MWRANK, NetworkX,
NTL, Numpy, PARI, Singular and many specialized
systems and libraries. It is free and open source, and is available
under the terms of the GNU Public License. Some parts are available
under compatible licenses.

Everybody who uses Sage should contribute something back to Sage at
some point. Implement a new function, add examples to the
documentation, find bugs and typos, fix a bug, create a new class,
create a fast new C library, etc. This book is a guide on how to
contribute to Sage.

This document describes how to write programs using Sage, how to
modify and extend the core Sage libraries, and how to modify Sage's
documentation. It also discusses how to share your new and modified
code with other Sage users.
