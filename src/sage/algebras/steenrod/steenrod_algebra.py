The Steenrod algebra

AUTHORS:

- John H. Palmieri (2008-07-30): version 0.9: Initial implementation.
- John H. Palmieri (2010-06-30): version 1.0: Implemented sub-Hopf
  algebras and profile functions; direct multiplication of admissible
  sequences (rather than conversion to the Milnor basis); implemented
  the Steenrod algebra using CombinatorialFreeModule; improved the
  test suite.

This module defines the mod `p` Steenrod algebra `\mathcal{A}_p`, some
of its properties, and ways to define elements of it.

From a topological point of view, `\mathcal{A}_p` is the algebra of
stable cohomology operations on mod `p` cohomology; thus for any
topological space `X`, its mod `p` cohomology algebra
`H^*(X,\mathbf{F}_p)` is a module over `\mathcal{A}_p`.

From an algebraic point of view, `\mathcal{A}_p` is an
`\mathbf{F}_p`-algebra; when `p=2`, it is generated by elements
`\text{Sq}^i` for `i\geq 0` (the *Steenrod squares*), and when `p` is
odd, it is generated by elements `\mathcal{P}^i` for `i \geq 0` (the
*Steenrod reduced pth powers*) along with an element `\beta` (the *mod
p Bockstein*). The Steenrod algebra is graded: `\text{Sq}^i` is in
degree `i` for each `i`, `\beta` is in degree 1, and `\mathcal{P}^i`
is in degree `2(p-1)i`.

The unit element is `\text{Sq}^0` when `p=2` and
`\mathcal{P}^0` when `p` is odd. The generating
elements also satisfy the *Adem relations*. At the prime 2, these
have the form

.. math::

     \text{Sq}^a \text{Sq}^b   = \sum_{c=0}^{[a/2]} \binom{b-c-1}{a-2c} \text{Sq}^{a+b-c} \text{Sq}^c.

At odd primes, they are a bit more complicated; see Steenrod and
Epstein [SE] or :mod:`sage.algebras.steenrod.steenrod_algebra_bases`
for full details. These relations lead to the existence of the
*Serre-Cartan* basis for `\mathcal{A}_p`.

The mod `p` Steenrod algebra has the structure of a Hopf
algebra, and Milnor [Mil] has a beautiful description of the dual,
leading to a construction of the *Milnor basis* for
`\mathcal{A}_p`. In this module, elements in the Steenrod
algebra are represented, by default, using the Milnor basis.

.. rubric:: Bases for the Steenrod algebra

There are a handful of other bases studied in the literature; the
paper by Monks is a good reference.  Here is a quick summary:

- The *Milnor basis*. When `p=2`, the Milnor basis consists of symbols
  of the form `\text{Sq}(m_1, m_2, ..., m_t)`, where each `m_i` is a
  non-negative integer and if `t>1`, then the last entry `m_t > 0`.
  When `p` is odd, the Milnor basis consists of symbols of the form
  `Q_{e_1} Q_{e_2} ... \mathcal{P}(m_1, m_2, ..., m_t)`, where `0 \leq
  e_1 < e_2 < ...`, each `m_i` is a non-negative integer, and if
  `t>1`, then the last entry `m_t > 0`.

  When `p=2`, it can be convenient to use the notation
  `\mathcal{P}(-)` to mean `\text{Sq}(-)`, so that there is consistent
  notation for all primes.

- The *Serre-Cartan basis*.  This basis consists of 'admissible
  monomials' in the Steenrod operations. Thus at the prime 2, it
  consists of monomials `\text{Sq}^{m_1} \text{Sq}^{m_2}
  ... \text{Sq}^{m_t}` with `m_i \geq 2m_{i+1}` for each `i`.  At odd
  primes, this basis consists of monomials `\beta^{\epsilon_0}
  \mathcal{P}^{s_1} \beta^{\epsilon_1} \mathcal{P}^{s_2} ...
  \mathcal{P}^{s_k} \beta^{\epsilon_k}` with each `\epsilon_i` either
  0 or 1, `s_i \geq p s_{i+1} + \epsilon_i`, and `s_k \geq 1`.

Most of the rest of the bases are only defined when `p=2`.  The only
exceptions are the `P^s_t`-bases and the commutator bases, which are
defined at all primes.

- *Wood's Y basis*.  For pairs of non-negative integers `(m,k)`, let
  `w(m,k) = \text{Sq}^{2^m (2^{k+1}-1)}`. Wood's `Y` basis consists of
  monomials `w(m_0,k_0) ... w(m_t, k_t)` with `(m_i,k_i) >
  (m_{i+1},k_{i+1})`, in left lex order.

- *Wood's Z basis*. For pairs of non-negative integers `(m,k)`, let
  `w(m,k) = \text{Sq}^{2^m (2^{k+1}-1)}`. Wood's `Z` basis consists of
  monomials `w(m_0,k_0) ... w(m_t, k_t)` with `(m_i+k_i,m_i) >
  (m_{i+1}+k_{i+1},m_{i+1})`, in left lex order.

- *Wall's basis*. For any pair of integers `(m,k)` with `m \geq k \geq
  0`, let `Q^m_k = \text{Sq}^{2^k} \text{Sq}^{2^{k+1}}
  ... \text{Sq}^{2^m}`.  The elements of Wall's basis are monomials
  `Q^{m_0}_{k_0} ... Q^{m_t}_{k_t}` with `(m_i, k_i) > (m_{i+1},
  k_{i+1})`, ordered left lexicographically.

  (Note that `Q^m_k` is the reverse of the element `X^m_k` used in
  defining Arnon's A basis.)

- *Arnon's A basis*. For any pair of integers `(m,k)` with `m \geq k
  \geq 0`, let `X^m_k = \text{Sq}^{2^m} \text{Sq}^{2^{m-1}}
  ... \text{Sq}^{2^k}`.  The elements of Arnon's A basis are monomials
  `X^{m_0}_{k_0} ... X^{m_t}_{k_t}` with `(m_i, k_i) < (m_{i+1},
  k_{i+1})`, ordered left lexicographically.

  (Note that `X^m_k` is the reverse of the element `Q^m_k` used in
  defining Wall's basis.)

- *Arnon's C basis*. The elements of Arnon's C basis are monomials of
  the form `\text{Sq}^{t_1} ... \text{Sq}^{t_m}` where for each `i`,
  we have `t_i \leq 2t_{i+1}` and `2^i | t_{m-i}`.

- `P^s_t` *bases*.  Let `p=2`.  For integers `s \geq 0` and `t > 0`,
  the element `P^s_t` is the Milnor basis element `\mathcal{P}(0, ...,
  0, p^s, 0, ...)`, with the nonzero entry in position `t`. To obtain
  a `P^s_t`-basis, for each set `\{P^{s_1}_{t_1}, ...,
  P^{s_k}_{t_k}\}` of (distinct) `P^s_t`'s, one chooses an ordering
  and forms the monomials

  .. math::

      (P^{s_1}_{t_1})^{i_1} ... (P^{s_k}_{t_k})^{i_k}

  for all exponents `i_j` with `0 < i_j < p`.  When `p=2`, the set of
  all such monomials then forms a basis, and when `p` is odd, if one
  multiplies each such monomial on the left by products of the form
  `Q_{e_1} Q_{e_2} ...` with `0 \leq e_1 < e_2 < ...`, one obtains a
  basis.

  Thus one gets a basis by choosing an ordering on each set of
  `P^s_t`'s.  There are infinitely many orderings possible, and we
  have implemented four of them:

  - 'rlex': right lexicographic ordering

  - 'llex': left lexicographic ordering

  - 'deg': ordered by degree, which is the same as left lexicographic
    ordering on the pair `(s+t,t)`

  - 'revz': left lexicographic ordering on the pair `(s+t,s)`, which
    is the reverse of the ordering used (on elements in the same
    degrees as the `P^s_t`'s) in Wood's Z basis: 'revz' stands for
    'reversed Z'. This is the default: 'pst' is the same as
    'pst_revz'.

- *Commutator bases*.  Let `c_{i,1} = \mathcal{P}(p^i)`, let `c_{i,2}
  = [c_{i+1,1}, c_{i,1}]`, and inductively define `c_{i,k} =
  [c_{i+k-1,1}, c_{i,k-1}]`. Thus `c_{i,k}` is a `k`-fold iterated
  commutator of the elements `\mathcal{P}(p^i)`, ...,
  `\mathcal{P}(p^{i+k-1})`. Note that `\dim c_{i,k} = \dim P^i_k`.

  Commutator bases are obtained in much the same way as `P^s_t`-bases:
  for each set `\{c_{s_1,t_1}, ..., c_{s_k,t_k}\}` of (distinct)
  `c_{s,t}`'s, one chooses an ordering and forms the resulting
  monomials

  .. math::

      c_{s_1, t_1}^{i_1} ... c_{s_k,t_k}^{i_k}

  for all exponents `i_j` with `0 < i_j < p`.  When `p` is odd, one
  also needs to left-multiply by products of the `Q_i`'s.  As for
  `P^s_t`-bases, every ordering on each set of iterated commutators
  determines a basis, and the same four orderings have been defined
  for these bases as for the `P^s_t` bases: 'rlex', 'llex', 'deg',
  'revz'.

.. rubric:: Sub-Hopf algebras of the Steenrod algebra

The sub-Hopf algebras of the Steenrod algebra have been
classified.  Milnor proved that at the prime 2, the dual of the
Steenrod algebra `A_*` is isomorphic to a polynomial algebra

.. math::

   A_* \cong \GF{2} [\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3, ...].

The Milnor basis is dual to the monomial basis.  Furthermore, any sub-Hopf
algebra corresponds to a quotient of this of the form

.. math::

   A_* /(\xi_1^{2^{e_1}}, \xi_2^{2^{e_2}}, \xi_3^{2^{e_3}}, ...).

The list of exponents `(e_1, e_2, ...)` may be considered a function
`e` from the positive integers to the extended non-negative integers
(the non-negative integers and `\infty`); this is called the *profile
function* for the sub-Hopf algebra.  The profile function must satisfy
the condition

- `e(r) \geq \min( e(r-i) - i, e(i))` for all `0 < i < r`.

At odd primes, the situation is similar: the dual is isomorphic to the
tensor product of a polynomial algebra and an exterior algebra,

.. math::

   A_* = \GF{p} [\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3, ...] \otimes \Lambda (\tau_0, \tau_1, ...),

and any sub-Hopf algebra corresponds to a quotient of this of the form

.. math::

   A_* / (\xi_1^{p^{e_1}}, \xi_2^{p^{e_2}}, ...; \tau_0^{k_0}, \tau_1^{k_1}, ...).

Here the profile function has two pieces, `e` as at the prime 2, and
`k`, which maps the non-negative integers to the set `\{1, 2\}`.
These must satisfy the following conditions:

- `e(r) \geq \min( e(r-i) - i, e(i))` for all `0 < i < r`.

- if `k(i+j) = 1`, then either `e(i) \leq j` or `k(j) = 1` for all `i
  \geq 1`, `j \geq 0`.

(See Adams-Margolis, for example, for these results on profile
functions.)

This module allows one to construct the Steenrod algebra or any of its
sub-Hopf algebras, at any prime.  When defining a sub-Hopf algebra,
you must work with the Milnor basis or a `P^s_t`-basis.

.. rubric:: Elements of the Steenrod algebra

Basic arithmetic, `p=2`. To construct an element of the mod 2 Steenrod
algebra, use the function ``Sq``::

    sage: a = Sq(1,2)
    sage: b = Sq(4,1)
    sage: z = a + b
    sage: z
    Sq(1,2) + Sq(4,1)
    sage: Sq(4) * Sq(1,2)
    Sq(1,1,1) + Sq(2,3) + Sq(5,2)
    sage: z**2          # non-negative exponents work as they should
    Sq(1,2,1) + Sq(4,1,1)
    sage: z**0
    1

Basic arithmetic, `p>2`. To construct an element of the mod `p`
Steenrod algebra when `p` is odd, you should first define a Steenrod
algebra, using the ``SteenrodAlgebra`` command::

    sage: A3 = SteenrodAlgebra(3)

Having done this, the newly created algebra ``A3`` has methods ``Q``
and ``P`` which construct elements of ``A3``::

    sage: c = A3.Q(1,3,6); c
    Q_1 Q_3 Q_6
    sage: d = A3.P(2,0,1); d
    P(2,0,1)
    sage: c * d
    Q_1 Q_3 Q_6 P(2,0,1)
    sage: e = A3.P(3)
    sage: d * e
    P(5,0,1)
    sage: e * d
    P(1,1,1) + P(5,0,1)
    sage: c * c
    0
    sage: e ** 3
    2 P(1,2)

Note that one can construct an element like ``c`` above in one step,
without first constructing the algebra::

    sage: c = SteenrodAlgebra(3).Q(1,3,6)
    sage: c
    Q_1 Q_3 Q_6

And of course, you can do similar constructions with the mod 2
Steenrod algebra::

    sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra(2); A
    mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis
    sage: A.Sq(2,3,5)
    Sq(2,3,5)
    sage: A.P(2,3,5)   # when p=2, P = Sq
    Sq(2,3,5)
    sage: A.Q(1,4)     # when p=2, this gives a product of Milnor primitives
    Sq(0,1,0,0,1)

Associated to each element is its prime (the characteristic of the
underlying base field) and its basis (the basis for the Steenrod
algebra in which it lies)::

    sage: a = SteenrodAlgebra(basis='milnor').Sq(1,2,1)
    sage: a.prime()
    2
    sage: a.basis_name()
    'milnor'
    sage: a.degree()
    14

It can be viewed in other bases::

    sage: a.milnor() # same as a
    Sq(1,2,1)
    sage: a.change_basis('adem')
    Sq^9 Sq^4 Sq^1 + Sq^11 Sq^2 Sq^1 + Sq^13 Sq^1
    sage: a.change_basis('adem').change_basis('milnor')
    Sq(1,2,1)

Regardless of the prime, each element has an ``excess``, and if the
element is homogeneous, a ``degree``. The excess of
`\text{Sq}(i_1,i_2,i_3,...)` is `i_1 + i_2 + i_3 + ...`; when `p` is
odd, the excess of `Q_{0}^{e_0} Q_{1}^{e_1} ... \mathcal{P}(r_1, r_2,
...)` is `\sum e_i + 2 \sum r_i`. The excess of a linear combination
of Milnor basis elements is the minimum of the excesses of those basis
elements.

The degree of `\text{Sq}(i_1,i_2,i_3,...)` is `sum (2^n-1) i_n`, and
when `p` is odd, the degree of `Q_{0}^{\epsilon_0} Q_{1}^{\epsilon_1}
... \mathcal{P}(r_1, r_2, ...)` is `\sum \epsilon_i (2p^i - 1) + \sum
r_j (2p^j - 2)`.  The degree of a linear combination of such terms is
only defined if the terms all have the same degree.

Here are some simple examples::

    sage: z = Sq(1,2) + Sq(4,1)
    sage: z.degree()
    7
    sage: (Sq(0,0,1) + Sq(5,3)).degree()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Element is not homogeneous.
    sage: Sq(7,2,1).excess()
    10
    sage: z.excess()
    3
    sage: B = SteenrodAlgebra(3)
    sage: x = B.Q(1,4)
    sage: y = B.P(1,2,3)
    sage: x.degree()
    166
    sage: x.excess()
    2
    sage: y.excess()
    12

Elements have a ``weight`` in the May filtration, which (when `p=2`)
is related to the ``height`` function defined by Wall::

    sage: Sq(2,1,5).may_weight()
    9
    sage: Sq(2,1,5).wall_height()
    [2, 3, 2, 1, 1]
    sage: b = Sq(4)*Sq(8) + Sq(8)*Sq(4)
    sage: b.may_weight()
    2
    sage: b.wall_height()
    [0, 0, 1, 1]

Odd primary May weights::

    sage: A5 = SteenrodAlgebra(5)
    sage: a = A5.Q(1,2,4)
    sage: b = A5.P(1,2,1)
    sage: a.may_weight()
    10
    sage: b.may_weight()
    8
    sage: (a * b).may_weight()
    18
    sage: A5.P(0,0,1).may_weight()
    3

Since the Steenrod algebra is a Hopf algebra, every element has a
coproduct and an antipode.

::

    sage: Sq(5).coproduct()
    1 # Sq(5) + Sq(1) # Sq(4) + Sq(2) # Sq(3) + Sq(3) # Sq(2) + Sq(4) # Sq(1) + Sq(5) # 1
    sage: Sq(5).antipode()
    Sq(2,1) + Sq(5)
    sage: d = Sq(0,0,1); d
    Sq(0,0,1)
    sage: d.antipode()
    Sq(0,0,1)
    sage: Sq(4).antipode()
    Sq(1,1) + Sq(4)
    sage: (Sq(4) * Sq(2)).antipode()
    Sq(6)
    sage: SteenrodAlgebra(7).P(3,1).antipode()
    P(3,1)

Applying the antipode twice returns the original element::

    sage: y = Sq(8)*Sq(4)
    sage: y == (y.antipode()).antipode()
    True

Internal representation: you can use any element as an iterator (``for
x in a: ...``), and the method :meth:`monomial_coefficients` returns a
dictionary with keys tuples representing basis elements and with
corresponding value representing the coefficient of that term::

    sage: c = Sq(5).antipode(); c
    Sq(2,1) + Sq(5)
    sage: for mono, coeff in c: print coeff, mono
    1 (5,)
    1 (2, 1)
    sage: c.monomial_coefficients()
    {(2, 1): 1, (5,): 1}
    sage: sorted(c.monomials(), key=lambda x: x.support())
    [Sq(2,1), Sq(5)]
    sage: sorted(c.support())
    [(2, 1), (5,)]
    sage: Adem = SteenrodAlgebra(basis='adem')
    sage: elt = Adem.Sq(10) + Adem.Sq(9) * Adem.Sq(1)
    sage: sorted(elt.monomials(), key=lambda x: x.support())
    [Sq^9 Sq^1, Sq^10]

    sage: A7 = SteenrodAlgebra(p=7)
    sage: a = A7.P(1) * A7.P(1); a
    2 P(2)
    sage: a.leading_coefficient()
    2
    sage: a.leading_monomial()
    P(2)
    sage: a.leading_term()
    2 P(2)
    sage: a.change_basis('adem').monomial_coefficients()
    {(0, 2, 0): 2}

The tuple in the previous output stands for the element `\beta^0
P^2 \beta^0`, i.e., `P^2`.  Going in the other direction, if you
want to specify a basis element by giving the corresponding tuple,
you can use the :meth:`monomial` method on the algebra::

    sage: SteenrodAlgebra(p=7, basis='adem').monomial((0, 2, 0))
    P^2
    sage: 10 * SteenrodAlgebra(p=7, basis='adem').monomial((0, 2, 0))
    3 P^2

In the following example, elements in Wood's Z basis are certain
products of the elements `w(m,k) = \text{Sq}^{2^m (2^{k+1}-1)}`.
Internally, each `w(m,k)` is represented by the pair `(m,k)`, and
products of them are represented by tuples of such pairs. ::

    sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra(basis='wood_z')
    sage: t = ((2, 0), (0, 0))
    sage: A.monomial(t)
    Sq^4 Sq^1

        - `i` - integer
        - ``component`` - either 0 or 1, optional (default 0)

        OUTPUT: integer or `\infty`

        See the documentation for
        :mod:`sage.algebras.steenrod.steenrod_algebra` and
        :func:`SteenrodAlgebra` for information on profile functions.

        This applies the profile function to the integer `i`.  Thus
        when `p=2`, `i` must be a positive integer.  When `p` is odd,
        there are two profile functions, `e` and `k` (in the notation
        of the aforementioned documentation), corresponding,
        respectively to ``component=0`` and ``component=1``.  So when
        `p` is odd and ``component`` is 0, `i` must be positive, while
        when ``component`` is 1, `i` must be non-negative.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: SteenrodAlgebra().profile(3)

        When the profile is specified by a list, the default behavior
        is to return zero values outside the range of the list.  This
        can be overridden if the algebra is created with an infinite

        ALGORITHM: The coproduct on a Milnor basis element `P(n_1,
        n_2, ...)` is `\sum P(i_1, i_2, ...) \otimes P(j_1, j_2,
        ...)`, summed over all `i_k + j_k = n_k` for each `k`.  At odd
        primes, each element `Q_n` is primitive: its coproduct is `Q_n
        \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes Q_n`.

        One can deduce a coproduct formula for the Serre-Cartan basis
        from this: the coproduct on each `P^n` is `\sum P^i \otimes
        P^{n-i}` and at odd primes `\beta` is primitive.  Since the
        coproduct is an algebra map, one can then compute the
        coproduct on any Serre-Cartan basis element.

        Which of these methods is used is controlled by whether
        ``algorithm`` is 'milnor' or 'serre-cartan'.

        OUTPUT: the antipode of the corresponding basis element,
        as an element of self.

        ALGORITHM: according to a result of Milnor's, the antipode of
        `\text{Sq}(n)` is the sum of all of the Milnor basis elements
        in dimension `n`. So: convert the element to the Serre-Cartan
        basis, thus writing it as a sum of products of elements
        `\text{Sq}(n)`, and use Milnor's formula for the antipode of
        `\text{Sq}(n)`, together with the fact that the antipode is an
        antihomomorphism: if we call the antipode `c`, then `c(ab) =
        c(b) c(a)`.

        At odd primes, a similar method is used: the antipode of
        `P(n)` is the sum of the Milnor P basis elements in dimension
        `n*2(p-1)`, multiplied by `(-1)^n`, and the antipode of `\beta
        = Q_0` is `-Q_0`. So convert to the Serre-Cartan basis, as in
        the `p=2` case.

        Convert the tuple ``t`` in the current basis to an element in the
        Milnor basis.

        INPUT:

        - ``t`` - tuple, representing basis element in the current basis.

        OUTPUT: element of the Steenrod algebra with the Milnor basis

        ALGORITHM: there is a simple conversion from each basis to the
        Milnor basis, so use that.  In more detail:

        - If the current basis is the Milnor basis, just return the
          corresponding element.

        - If the current basis is the Serre-Cartan basis: when `p=2`,
          the element `\text{Sq}^a` equals the Milnor element
          `\text{Sq}(a)`; when `p` is odd, `\mathcal{P}^a =
          \mathcal{P}(a)` and `\beta = Q_0`. Hence for any
          Serre-Cartan basis element, represent it in the
          Milnor basis by computing an appropriate product using
          Milnor multiplication.

        - The same goes for Arnon's C basis, since the elements are
          monomials in the Steenrod squares.

        - If the current basis is Wood's Y or Z bases, then each basis
          element is a monomial in the classes `w(m,k) =
          \text{Sq}^{2^m (2^{k+1}-1)}`.  So again, multiply the
          corresponding Milnor elements together.

        - The Wall basis: each basis element is a monomial in the
          elements `Q^m_k = Sq(2^k) Sq(2^{k+1}) ... Sq(2^m)`.

        - Arnon's A basis: each basis element is a monomial in the
          elements `X^m_k = Sq(2^m) ... Sq(2^{k+1}) Sq(2^k)`.

        - The `P^s_t` bases: when `p=2`, each basis element is a
          monomial in the elements `P^s_t`.  When `p` is odd, each
          basis element is a product of elements `Q_i` and a monomial
          in the elements `(P^s_t)^n` where `0 < n < p`.

        - The commutator bases: when `p=2`, each basis element is a
          monomial in the iterated commutators `c_{i,j}`, defined by
          `c_{i,1} = \text{Sq}(2^i)` and `c_{i,j} = [c_{i,j-1},
          \text{Sq}(2^{i+j-1})]`.  When `p` is odd, each basis element
          is a product of elements `Q_i` and a monomial in the
          elements `c_{i,j}^n` where `0 < n < p`, `c_{i,1} =
          P(p^i)` and `c_{i,j} = [P(p^{i+j-1}), c_{i,j-1}]`.

        OUTPUT: family of elements of this algebra

        At the prime 2, the Steenrod algebra is generated by the
        elements `\text{Sq}^{2^i}` for `i \geq 0`.  At odd primes, it
        is generated by the elements `Q_0` and `\mathcal{P}^{p^i}` for

        For sub-Hopf algebras of the Steenrod algebra, it is not
        always clear what a minimal generating set is.  The sub-Hopf
        algebra `A(n)` is minimally generated by the elements
        `\text{Sq}^{2^i}` for `0 \leq i \leq n` at the prime 2.  At
        odd primes, `A(n)` is minimally generated by `Q_0` along with
        `\mathcal{P}^{p^i}` for `0 \leq i \leq n-1`.  So if this
        algebra is `A(n)`, return the appropriate list of generators.

        For other sub-Hopf algebras: return a non-minimal generating
        set: the family of `P^s_t`'s and `Q_n`'s contained in the
        algebra.

        commutator of `\text{Sq}(1)` and `\text{Sq}(0,2)`.) ::

        algebra is `A(n)`, return the appropriate generator.

        For other sub-Hopf algebras: they are generated (but not
        necessarily minimally) by the `P^s_t`'s (and `Q_n`'s, if `p`
        is odd) that they contain.  So order the `P^s_t`'s (and

            May's 'weight' of element.

            OUTPUT: ``weight`` - non-negative integer

            If we let `F_* (A)` be the May filtration of the Steenrod
            algebra, the weight of an element `x` is the integer `k` so
            that `x` is in `F_k(A)` and not in `F_{k+1}(A)`. According to
            Theorem 2.6 in May's thesis [May], the weight of a Milnor
            basis element is computed as follows: first, to compute the
            weight of `P(r_1,r_2, ...)`, write each `r_i` in base `p` as
            `r_i = \sum_j p^j r_{ij}`. Then each nonzero binary digit
            `r_{ij}` contributes `i` to the weight: the weight is
            `\sum_{i,j} i r_{ij}`. When `p` is odd, the weight of `Q_i` is
            `i+1`, so the weight of a product `Q_{i_1} Q_{i_2} ...` equals
            `(i_1+1) + (i_2+1) + ...`. Then the weight of `Q_{i_1} Q_{i_2}
            ...P(r_1,r_2, ...)` is the sum of `(i_1+1) + (i_2+1) + ...`
            and `\sum_{i,j} i r_{ij}`.

            The weight of a sum of Milnor basis elements is the minimum of
            the weights of the summands.

            When `p=2`, we compute the weight on Milnor basis elements by
            adding up the terms in their 'height' - see
            :meth:`wall_height` for documentation. (When `p` is odd, the
            height of an element is not defined.)

            Wall's 'height' of element.

            OUTPUT: list of non-negative integers

            The height of an element of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra is a
            list of non-negative integers, defined as follows: if the
            element is a monomial in the generators `\text{Sq}(2^i)`, then
            the `i^{th}` entry in the list is the number of times
            `\text{Sq}(2^i)` appears. For an arbitrary element, write it
            as a sum of such monomials; then its height is the maximum,
            ordered right-lexicographically, of the heights of those
            monomials.

            When `p` is odd, the height of an element is not defined.

            According to Theorem 3 in [Wall], the height of the Milnor
            basis element `\text{Sq}(r_1, r_2, ...)` is obtained as
            follows: write each `r_i` in binary as `r_i = \sum_j 2^j
            r_{ij}`. Then each nonzero binary digit `r_{ij}` contributes 1
            to the `k^{th}` entry in the height, for `j \leq k \leq
            i+j-1`.

    You can test whether elements are contained in the Steenrod

        sage: w in SteenrodAlgebra(2)
        True
        sage: w in SteenrodAlgebra(17)
        False

    .. rubric:: Different bases for the Steenrod algebra:

    There are two standard vector space bases for the mod `p` Steenrod
    algebra: the Milnor basis and the Serre-Cartan basis. When `p=2`,
    there are also several other, less well-known, bases. See the
    documentation for this module (type
    ``sage.algebras.steenrod.steenrod_algebra?``) and the function
    :func:`steenrod_algebra_basis
    <sage.algebras.steenrod.steenrod_algebra_bases.steenrod_algebra_basis_>`
    for full descriptions of each of the implemented bases.

    This module implements the following bases at all primes:

    - 'milnor': Milnor basis.

    - 'serre-cartan' or 'adem' or 'admissible': Serre-Cartan basis.

    - 'pst', 'pst_rlex', 'pst_llex', 'pst_deg', 'pst_revz': various
      `P^s_t`-bases.

    - 'comm', 'comm_rlex', 'comm_llex', 'comm_deg', 'comm_revz', or
      these with '_long' appended: various commutator bases.

    It implements the following bases when `p=2`:

    - 'wood_y': Wood's Y basis.

    - 'wood_z': Wood's Z basis.

    - 'wall', 'wall_long': Wall's basis.

    - 'arnon_a', 'arnon_a_long': Arnon's A basis.

    - 'arnon_c': Arnon's C basis.

    When defining a Steenrod algebra, you can specify a basis. Then
    elements of that Steenrod algebra are printed in that basis::

        sage: adem = SteenrodAlgebra(2, 'adem')
        sage: x = adem.Sq(2,1)  # Sq(-) always means a Milnor basis element
        sage: x
        Sq^4 Sq^1 + Sq^5
        sage: y = Sq(0,1)    # unadorned Sq defines elements w.r.t. Milnor basis
        sage: y
        Sq(0,1)
        sage: adem(y)
        Sq^2 Sq^1 + Sq^3
        sage: adem5 = SteenrodAlgebra(5, 'serre-cartan')
        sage: adem5.P(0,2)
        P^10 P^2 + 4 P^11 P^1 + P^12

    If you add or multiply elements defined using different bases, the
    left-hand factor determines the form of the output::

        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='adem').Sq(3) + SteenrodAlgebra(basis='pst').Sq(0,1)
        Sq^2 Sq^1
        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='pst').Sq(3) + SteenrodAlgebra(basis='milnor').Sq(0,1)
        P^0_1 P^1_1 + P^0_2
        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='milnor').Sq(2) * SteenrodAlgebra(basis='arnonc').Sq(2)
        Sq(1,1)

    You can get a list of basis elements in a given dimension::

        sage: A3 = SteenrodAlgebra(3, 'milnor')
        sage: A3.basis(13)
        Family (Q_1 P(2), Q_0 P(3))

    Algebras defined over different bases are not equal::

        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='milnor') == SteenrodAlgebra(basis='pst')
        False

    Bases have various synonyms, and in general Sage tries to figure
    out what basis you meant::

        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='MiLNOr')
        mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis
        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='MiLNOr') == SteenrodAlgebra(basis='milnor')
        True
        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='adem')
        mod 2 Steenrod algebra, serre-cartan basis
        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='adem').basis_name()
        'serre-cartan'
        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(basis='wood---z---').basis_name()
        'woodz'

    As noted above, several of the bases ('arnon_a', 'wall', 'comm')
    have alternate, sometimes longer, representations. These provide
    ways of expressing elements of the Steenrod algebra in terms of
    the `\text{Sq}^{2^n}`.

    ::

        sage: A_long = SteenrodAlgebra(2, 'arnon_a_long')
        sage: A_long(Sq(6))

        sage: SteenrodAlgebra(2, 'wall_long')(Sq(6))

    .. rubric:: Sub-Hopf algebras of the Steenrod algebra:

    These are specified using the argument ``profile``, along with,
    optionally, ``truncation_type`` and ``precision``.  The
    ``profile`` argument specifies the profile function for this
    algebra.  Any sub-Hopf algebra of the Steenrod algebra is
    determined by its *profile function*.  When `p=2`, this is a map `e`
    from the positive integers to the set of non-negative integers,
    plus `\infty`, corresponding to the sub-Hopf algebra dual to this
    quotient of the dual Steenrod algebra:

    .. math::

        \GF{2} [\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3, ...] / (\xi_1^{2^{e(1)}}, \xi_2^{2^{e(2)}}, \xi_3^{2^{e(3)}}, ...).

    The profile function `e` must satisfy the condition

    - `e(r) \geq \min( e(r-i) - i, e(i))` for all `0 < i < r`.

    This is specified via ``profile``, and optionally ``precision``
    and ``truncation_type``.  First, ``profile`` must have one of the
    following forms:

    - a list or tuple, e.g., ``[3,2,1]``, corresponding to the
      function sending 1 to 3, 2 to 2, 3 to 1, and all other integers
      to the value of ``truncation_type``.
    - a function from positive integers to non-negative integers (and
      `\infty`), e.g., ``lambda n: n+2``.
    - ``None`` or ``Infinity`` - use this for the profile function for
      the whole Steenrod algebra.

    In the first and third cases, ``precision`` is ignored.  In the
    second case, this function is converted to a tuple of length one
    less than ``precision``, which has default value 100.  The
    function is truncated at this point, and all remaining values are
    set to the value of ``truncation_type``.

    ``truncation_type`` may be 0, `\infty`, or 'auto'.  If it's
    'auto', then it gets converted to 0 in the first case above (when
    ``profile`` is a list), and otherwise (when ``profile`` is a
    function, ``None``, or ``Infinity``) it gets converted to `\infty`.

    For example, the sub-Hopf algebra `A(2)` has profile function
    ``[3,2,1,0,0,0,...]``, so it can be defined by any of the
    following::

        sage: A2 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[3,2,1])
        sage: B2 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[3,2,1,0,0]) # trailing 0's ignored
        sage: A2 == B2
        True
        sage: C2 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=lambda n: max(4-n, 0), truncation_type=0)
        sage: A2 == C2
        True

    In the following case, the profile function is specified by a
    function and ``truncation_type`` isn't specified, so it defaults
    to `\infty`; therefore this gives a different sub-Hopf algebra::

        sage: D2 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=lambda n: max(4-n, 0))
        sage: A2 == D2
        False
        sage: D2.is_finite()
        False
        sage: E2 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=lambda n: max(4-n, 0), truncation_type=Infinity)
        sage: D2 == E2
        True

    The argument ``precision`` only needs to be specified if the
    profile function is defined by a function and you want to control
    when the profile switches from the given function to the
    truncation type.  For example::

        sage: D3 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=lambda n: n, precision=3)
        sage: D3
        sub-Hopf algebra of mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis, profile function [1, 2, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, ...]
        sage: D4 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=lambda n: n, precision=4); D4
        sub-Hopf algebra of mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis, profile function [1, 2, 3, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, ...]
        sage: D3 == D4
        False

    When `p` is odd, ``profile`` is a pair of functions `e` and `k`,
    corresponding to the quotient

    .. math::

        \GF{p} [\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3, ...] \otimes \Lambda (\tau_0,
        \tau_1, ...) / (\xi_1^{p^{e_1}}, \xi_2^{p^{e_2}}, ...;
        \tau_0^{k_0}, \tau_1^{k_1}, ...).

    Together, the functions `e` and `k` must satisfy the conditions

    - `e(r) \geq \min( e(r-i) - i, e(i))` for all `0 < i < r`,

    - if `k(i+j) = 1`, then either `e(i) \leq j` or `k(j) = 1` for all `i
      \geq 1`, `j \geq 0`.

    Therefore ``profile`` must have one of the following forms:

    - a pair of lists or tuples, the second of which takes values in
      the set `\{1,2\}`, e.g., ``([3,2,1,1], [1,1,2,2,1])``.

    - a pair of functions, one from the positive integers to
      non-negative integers (and `\infty`), one from the non-negative
      integers to the set `\{1,2\}`, e.g., ``(lambda n: n+2, lambda n:
      1 if n<3 else 2)``.

    - ``None`` or ``Infinity`` - use this for the profile function for
      the whole Steenrod algebra.

    You can also mix and match the first two, passing a pair with
    first entry a list and second entry a function, for instance.  The
    values of ``precision`` and ``truncation_type`` are determined by
    the first entry.

    .. rubric:: The generic Steenrod algebra at the prime `2`:

    The structure formulas for the Steenrod algebra at odd primes `p` also make sense
    when `p` is set to `2`. We refer to the resulting algebra as the "generic Steenrod algebra" for
    the prime `2`. The dual Hopf algebra is given by

        .. math::

            A_* = \GF{2} [\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3, ...] \otimes \Lambda (\tau_0, \tau_1, ...)

    The degree of `\xi_k` is `2^{k+1}-2` and the degree of `\tau_k` is `2^{k+1}-1`.

    The generic Steenrod algebra is an associated graded algebra of the usual Steenrod algebra
    that is occasionally useful. Its cohomology, for example, is the `E_2`-term of a spectral sequence
    that computes the `E_2`-term of the Novikov spectral sequence. It can also be obtained as a
    specialisation of Voevodsky's "motivic Steenrod algebra": in the notation of [VO], Remark 12.12,
    it corresponds to setting `\rho = \tau = 0`. The usual Steenrod algebra is given by `\rho = 0`
    and `\tau = 1`.

    In Sage this algebra is constructed using the 'generic' keyword.

    Example::

        sage: EA = SteenrodAlgebra(p=2,generic=True) ; EA
        generic mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis
        sage: EA[8]
        Vector space spanned by (Q_0 Q_2, Q_0 Q_1 P(2), P(1,1), P(4)) over Finite Field of size 2

    TESTS:

    Testing unique parents::

        sage: S0 = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
        sage: S1 = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
        sage: S0 is S1
        True
        sage: S2 = SteenrodAlgebra(2, basis='adem')
        sage: S0 is S2
        False
        sage: S0 == S2
        False
        sage: A1 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[2,1])
        sage: B1 = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[2,1,0,0])
        sage: A1 is B1
        True

def AA(n=None, p=2):

    This returns the Steenrod algebra `A` or its sub-Hopf algebra `A(n)`.

    INPUT:

    - `n` - non-negative integer, optional (default None)
    - `p` - prime number, optional (default 2)

    OUTPUT: If `n` is None, then return the full Steenrod algebra.
    Otherwise, return `A(n)`.

    When `p=2`, `A(n)` is the sub-Hopf algebra generated by the
    elements `\text{Sq}^i` for `i \leq 2^n`.  Its profile function is
    `(n+1, n, n-1, ...)`.  When `p` is odd, `A(n)` is the sub-Hopf
    algebra generated by the elements `Q_0` and `\mathcal{P}^i` for `i
    \leq p^{n-1}`.  Its profile function is `e=(n, n-1, n-2, ...)`
    and `k=(2, 2, ..., 2)` (length `n+1`).

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.algebras.steenrod.steenrod_algebra import AA as A
        sage: A()
        mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis
        sage: A(2)
        sub-Hopf algebra of mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis, profile function [3, 2, 1]
        sage: A(2, p=5)
        sub-Hopf algebra of mod 5 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis, profile function ([2, 1], [2, 2, 2])

def Sq(*nums):

    Milnor element Sq(a,b,c,...).

    INPUT:

    -  ``a, b, c, ...`` - non-negative integers

    OUTPUT: element of the Steenrod algebra

    This returns the Milnor basis element
    `\text{Sq}(a, b, c, ...)`.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: Sq(5)
        Sq(5)
        sage: Sq(5) + Sq(2,1) + Sq(5)  # addition is mod 2:
        Sq(2,1)
        sage: (Sq(4,3) + Sq(7,2)).degree()
        13

    Entries must be non-negative integers; otherwise, an error
    results.

    This function is a good way to define elements of the Steenrod
    algebra.
