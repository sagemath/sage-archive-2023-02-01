Graph Format
------------

Supported formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sage Graphs can be created from a wide range of inputs. A few examples are
covered here.

- NetworkX dictionary format:

   ::

       sage: d = {0: [1,4,5], 1: [2,6], 2: [3,7], 3: [4,8], 4: [9], \
             5: [7, 8], 6: [8,9], 7: [9]}
       sage: G = Graph(d); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()

- A NetworkX graph:

   ::

       sage: import networkx
       sage: K = networkx.complete_bipartite_graph(12,7)
       sage: G = Graph(K)
       sage: G.degree()
       [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12]

- graph6 or sparse6 format:

   ::

       sage: s = ':I`AKGsaOs`cI]Gb~'
       sage: G = Graph(s, sparse=True); G
       Looped multi-graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()

   Note that the ``\`` character is an escape character in Python, and also a
   character used by graph6 strings:

   ::

       sage: G = Graph('Ihe\n@GUA')
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       RuntimeError: the string (Ihe) seems corrupt: for n = 10, the string is too short

   In Python, the escaped character ``\`` is represented by ``\\``:

   ::

       sage: G = Graph('Ihe\\n@GUA')
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()

- adjacency matrix: In an adjacency matrix, each column and each row represent a
   vertex. If a 1 shows up in row `i`, column `j`, there is an edge `(i,j)`.

   ::

       sage: M = Matrix([(0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0),(1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0), \
       (0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0),(1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1), \
       (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0), (0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1),(0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1), \
       (0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0), (0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0)])
       sage: M
       [0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
       [1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
       [0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0]
       [0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0]
       [1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]
       [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
       [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
       [0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
       [0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0]
       [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0]
       sage: G = Graph(M); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()

- incidence matrix: In an incidence matrix, each row represents a vertex and
   each column represents an edge.

   ::

       sage: M = Matrix([(-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0),
       ....:             ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)])
       sage: M
       [-1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0  0]
       [ 1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0]
       [ 0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0]
       [ 0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0]
       [ 0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0  1  1  0  0  0  0]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  1  0  0  0]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  1  0]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1]
       sage: G = Graph(M); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()
       sage: DiGraph(matrix(2,[0,0,-1,1]), format="incidence_matrix")
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       ValueError: there must be two nonzero entries (-1 & 1) per column

- a list of edges::

       sage: g = Graph([(1,3),(3,8),(5,2)])
       sage: g
       Graph on 5 vertices

- an igraph Graph::

       sage: import igraph                                # optional - python_igraph
       sage: g = Graph(igraph.Graph([(1,3),(3,2),(0,2)])) # optional - python_igraph
       sage: g                                            # optional - python_igraph
       Graph on 4 vertices

Generators
----------

Use ``graphs(n)`` to iterate through all non-isomorphic graphs of given size::

    sage: for g in graphs(4):
    ....:     print(g.degree_sequence())
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
    [2, 1, 1, 0]
    [3, 1, 1, 1]
    [1, 1, 1, 1]
    [2, 2, 1, 1]
    [2, 2, 2, 0]
    [3, 2, 2, 1]
    [2, 2, 2, 2]
    [3, 3, 2, 2]
    [3, 3, 3, 3]

Similarly ``graphs()`` will iterate through all graphs. The complete graph of 4
vertices is of course the smallest graph with chromatic number bigger than
three::

    sage: for g in graphs():
    ....:     if g.chromatic_number() > 3:
    ....:         break
    sage: g.is_isomorphic(graphs.CompleteGraph(4))
    True

For some commonly used graphs to play with, type::

    sage: graphs.[tab]          # not tested

and hit {tab}. Most of these graphs come with their own custom plot, so you can
see how people usually visualize these graphs.

::

    sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()
    sage: G.degree_histogram()
    [0, 0, 0, 10]
    sage: G.adjacency_matrix()
    [0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
    [1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0]
    [1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
    [0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0]

::

    sage: S = G.subgraph([0,1,2,3])
    sage: S.plot().show()    # or S.show()
    sage: S.density()
    1/2

::

    sage: G = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'], num_vertices=7, diameter=5)
    sage: L = G.get_graphs_list()
    sage: graphs_list.show_graphs(L)

.. _Graph:labels:

Labels
------

Each vertex can have any hashable object as a label. These are things like
strings, numbers, and tuples. Each edge is given a default label of ``None``,
but if specified, edges can have any label at all. Edges between vertices `u`
and `v` are represented typically as ``(u, v, l)``, where ``l`` is the label for
the edge.

Note that vertex labels themselves cannot be mutable items::

    sage: M = Matrix( [[0,0],[0,0]] )
    sage: G = Graph({ 0 : { M : None } })
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable

However, if one wants to define a dictionary, with the same keys and arbitrary
objects for entries, one can make that association::

    sage: d = {0 : graphs.DodecahedralGraph(), 1 : graphs.FlowerSnark(), \
          2 : graphs.MoebiusKantorGraph(), 3 : graphs.PetersenGraph() }
    sage: d[2]
    Moebius-Kantor Graph: Graph on 16 vertices
    sage: T = graphs.TetrahedralGraph()
    sage: T.vertices()
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
    sage: T.set_vertices(d)
    sage: T.get_vertex(1)
    Flower Snark: Graph on 20 vertices

Database
--------

There is a database available for searching for graphs that satisfy a certain
set of parameters, including number of vertices and edges, density, maximum and
minimum degree, diameter, radius, and connectivity. To see a list of all search
parameter keywords broken down by their designated table names, type ::

    sage: graph_db_info()
    {...}

For more details on data types or keyword input, enter ::

    sage: GraphQuery?    # not tested

The results of a query can be viewed with the show method, or can be viewed
individually by iterating through the results ::

    sage: Q = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'],num_vertices=7, diameter=5)
    sage: Q.show()
    Graph6
    --------------------
    F?`po
    F?gqg
    F@?]O
    F@OKg
    F@R@o
    FA_pW
    FEOhW
    FGC{o
    FIAHo

Show each graph as you iterate through the results::

    sage: for g in Q:
    ....:     show(g)

Visualization
-------------

To see a graph `G` you are working with, there are three main options. You can
view the graph in two dimensions via matplotlib with ``show()``. ::

    sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(15,.3)
    sage: G.show()

And you can view it in three dimensions via jmol with ``show3d()``. ::

    sage: G.show3d()

Or it can be rendered with `\LaTeX`.  This requires the right additions to a
standard `\mbox{\rm\TeX}` installation.  Then standard Sage commands, such as
``view(G)`` will display the graph, or ``latex(G)`` will produce a string
suitable for inclusion in a `\LaTeX` document.  More details on this are at the
:mod:`sage.graphs.graph_latex` module. ::

    sage: from sage.graphs.graph_latex import check_tkz_graph
    sage: check_tkz_graph()  # random - depends on TeX installation
    sage: latex(G)
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    ...
    \end{tikzpicture}

Mutability
----------

Graphs are mutable, and thus unusable as dictionary keys, unless
``data_structure="static_sparse"`` is used::

    sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: {G:1}[G]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. Create an immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`
    sage: G_immutable = Graph(G, immutable=True)
    sage: G_immutable == G
    True
    sage: {G_immutable:1}[G_immutable]
    1

class Graph(GenericGraph):
    r"""
    Undirected graph.

    A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges. See the
    :wikipedia:`Graph_(mathematics)` for more information. For a collection of
    pre-defined graphs, see the :mod:`~sage.graphs.graph_generators` module.

    A :class:`Graph` object has many methods whose list can be obtained by
    typing ``g.<tab>`` (i.e. hit the 'tab' key) or by reading the documentation
    of :mod:`~sage.graphs.graph`, :mod:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph`, and
    :mod:`~sage.graphs.digraph`.

    INPUT:

    By default, a :class:`Graph` object is simple (i.e. no *loops* nor *multiple
    edges*) and unweighted. This can be easily tuned with the appropriate flags
    (see below).

    - ``data`` -- can be any of the following (see the ``format`` argument):

      #. ``Graph()`` -- build a graph on 0 vertices.

      #. ``Graph(5)`` -- return an edgeless graph on the 5 vertices 0,...,4.

      #. ``Graph([list_of_vertices, list_of_edges])`` -- returns a graph with
         given vertices/edges.

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph([V, E], format='vertices_and_edges')``.

      #. ``Graph(list_of_edges)`` -- return a graph with a given list of edges
         (see documentation of
         :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.add_edges`).

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph(L, format='list_of_edges')``.

      #. ``Graph({1: [2, 3, 4], 3: [4]})`` -- return a graph by associating to
         each vertex the list of its neighbors.

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph(D, format='dict_of_lists')``.

      #. ``Graph({1: {2: 'a', 3:'b'} ,3:{2:'c'}})`` -- return a graph by
         associating a list of neighbors to each vertex and providing its edge
         label.

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph(D, format='dict_of_dicts')``.

         For graphs with multiple edges, you can provide a list of labels
         instead, e.g.: ``Graph({1: {2: ['a1', 'a2'], 3:['b']} ,3:{2:['c']}})``.

      #. ``Graph(a_symmetric_matrix)`` -- return a graph with given (weighted)
         adjacency matrix (see documentation of
         :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.adjacency_matrix`).

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit ``Graph(M,
         format='adjacency_matrix')``. To take weights into account, use
         ``format='weighted_adjacency_matrix'`` instead.

      #. ``Graph(a_nonsymmetric_matrix)`` -- return a graph with given incidence
         matrix (see documentation of
         :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.incidence_matrix`).

         To bypass auto-detection, prefer the more explicit
         ``Graph(M, format='incidence_matrix')``.

      #. ``Graph([V, f])`` -- return a graph from a vertex set ``V`` and a
         *symmetric* function ``f``. The graph contains an edge `u,v` whenever
         ``f(u,v)`` is ``True``.. Example: ``Graph([ [1..10], lambda x,y:
         abs(x-y).is_square()])``

      #. ``Graph(':I`ES@obGkqegW~')`` -- return a graph from a graph6 or sparse6
         string (see documentation of :meth:`graph6_string` or
         :meth:`sparse6_string`).

      #. ``Graph(a_seidel_matrix, format='seidel_adjacency_matrix')`` -- return
         a graph with a given Seidel adjacency matrix (see documentation of
         :meth:`seidel_adjacency_matrix`).

      #. ``Graph(another_graph)`` -- return a graph from a Sage (di)graph,
         `pygraphviz <https://pygraphviz.github.io/>`__ graph, `NetworkX
         <https://networkx.github.io/>`__ graph, or `igraph
         <http://igraph.org/python/>`__ graph.

    - ``pos`` -- a positioning dictionary (cf. documentation of
      :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.layout`). For example, to
      draw 4 vertices on a square::

         {0: [-1,-1],
          1: [ 1,-1],
          2: [ 1, 1],
          3: [-1, 1]}

    - ``name`` -- (must be an explicitly named parameter, i.e.,
       ``name="complete")`` gives the graph a name

    - ``loops`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to allow loops (ignored
       if data is an instance of the ``Graph`` class)

    - ``multiedges`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to allow multiple
       edges (ignored if data is an instance of the ``Graph`` class).

    - ``weighted`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether graph thinks of
      itself as weighted or not. See
      :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.weighted`.

    - ``format`` -- if set to ``None`` (default), :class:`Graph` tries to guess
      input's format. To avoid this possibly time-consuming step, one of the
      following values can be specified (see description above): ``"int"``,
      ``"graph6"``, ``"sparse6"``, ``"rule"``, ``"list_of_edges"``,
      ``"dict_of_lists"``, ``"dict_of_dicts"``, ``"adjacency_matrix"``,
      ``"weighted_adjacency_matrix"``, ``"seidel_adjacency_matrix"``,
      ``"incidence_matrix"``, ``"NX"``, ``"igraph"``.

    - ``sparse`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); ``sparse=True`` is an alias for
      ``data_structure="sparse"``, and ``sparse=False`` is an alias for
      ``data_structure="dense"``.

    - ``data_structure`` -- one of the following (for more information, see
      :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.overview`)

       * ``"dense"`` -- selects the :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.dense_graph`
         backend.

       * ``"sparse"`` -- selects the :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph`
         backend.

       * ``"static_sparse"`` -- selects the
         :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend` (this backend is faster
         than the sparse backend and smaller in memory, and it is immutable, so
         that the resulting graphs can be used as dictionary keys).

    - ``immutable`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to create a
      immutable graph. Note that ``immutable=True`` is actually a shortcut for
      ``data_structure='static_sparse'``. Set to ``False`` by default.

    - ``vertex_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to allow any
      object as a vertex (slower), or only the integers `0,...,n-1`, where `n`
      is the number of vertices.

    - ``convert_empty_dict_labels_to_None`` -- this arguments sets the default
       edge labels used by NetworkX (empty dictionaries) to be replaced by
       ``None``, the default Sage edge label. It is set to ``True`` iff a
       NetworkX graph is on the input.

    EXAMPLES:

    We illustrate the first seven input formats (the other two involve packages
    that are currently not standard in Sage):

    #. An integer giving the number of vertices::

        sage: g = Graph(5); g
        Graph on 5 vertices
        sage: g.vertices()
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        sage: g.edges()
        []

    #. A dictionary of dictionaries::

        sage: g = Graph({0:{1:'x',2:'z',3:'a'}, 2:{5:'out'}}); g
        Graph on 5 vertices

       The labels ('x', 'z', 'a', 'out') are labels for edges. For example,
       'out' is the label for the edge on 2 and 5. Labels can be used as
       weights, if all the labels share some common parent.::

        sage: a,b,c,d,e,f = sorted(SymmetricGroup(3))
        sage: Graph({b:{d:'c',e:'p'}, c:{d:'p',e:'c'}})
        Graph on 4 vertices

    #. A dictionary of lists::

        sage: g = Graph({0:[1,2,3], 2:[4]}); g
        Graph on 5 vertices

    #. A list of vertices and a function describing adjacencies. Note that the
       list of vertices and the function must be enclosed in a list (i.e., [list
       of vertices, function]).

       Construct the Paley graph over GF(13).::

          sage: g=Graph([GF(13), lambda i,j: i!=j and (i-j).is_square()])
          sage: g.vertices()
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
          sage: g.adjacency_matrix()
          [0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1]
          [1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
          [0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1]

          [0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0]
          [0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1]
          [1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]
          [1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0]
          [0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1]
          [1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0]

       Construct the line graph of a complete graph.::

          sage: g=graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
          sage: line_graph=Graph([g.edges(labels=false), \
                 lambda i,j: len(set(i).intersection(set(j)))>0], \
                 loops=False)
          sage: line_graph.vertices()
          [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
          sage: line_graph.adjacency_matrix()
          [0 1 1 1 1 0]
          [1 0 1 1 0 1]
          [1 1 0 0 1 1]
          [1 1 0 0 1 1]
          [1 0 1 1 0 1]
          [0 1 1 1 1 0]

           sage: Graph(s,sparse=True)

       There are also list functions to take care of lists of graphs::

    #. A Sage matrix:
       Note: If format is not specified, then Sage assumes a symmetric square
       matrix is an adjacency matrix, otherwise an incidence matrix.

           Graph on 3 vertices

       If ``vertex_labels`` is ``True``, the names of the vertices are given by
       the vertex attribute ``'name'``, if available::

       If the igraph Graph has edge attributes, they are used as edge labels::

           [(0, 1, {'name': 'a', 'weight': 1}), (0, 2, {'name': 'b', 'weight': 3})]


    When defining an undirected graph from a function ``f``, it is *very*
    important that ``f`` be symmetric. If it is not, anything can happen::

        sage: f_sym = lambda x,y: abs(x-y) == 1
        sage: f_nonsym = lambda x,y: (x-y) == 1
        sage: G_sym = Graph([[4,6,1,5,3,7,2,0], f_sym])

        sage: G_nonsym.size()
        4
        sage: G_nonsym.is_isomorphic(G_sym)

    By default, graphs are mutable and can thus not be used as a dictionary
    key::

    When providing the optional arguments ``data_structure="static_sparse"`` or

        Tests if the graph is a tree

        The empty graph is defined to be not a tree.

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return a
          certificate. The method only returns boolean answers when
          ``certificate = False`` (default). When it is set to ``True``, it
          either answers ``(True, None)`` when the graph is a tree or ``(False,
          cycle)`` when it contains a cycle. It returns ``(False, None)`` when
          the graph is empty or not connected.

        - ``output`` -- either ``'vertex'`` (default) or ``'edge'``; whether the
          certificate is given as a list of vertices (``output = 'vertex'``) or
          a list of edges (``output = 'edge'``).

        When the certificate cycle is given as a list of edges, the edges are
        given as `(v_i, v_{i+1}, l)` where `v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n` are the
        vertices of the cycles (in their cyclic order).

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: all(T.is_tree() for T in graphs.trees(15))
            True

        With certificates::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomTree(30)

            sage: isit
            False
            sage: -1 in cycle
            True

        One can also ask for the certificate as a list of edges::

            sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
            sage: g.is_tree(certificate=True, output='edge')
            (False, [(3, 2, None), (2, 1, None), (1, 0, None), (0, 3, None)])

        This is useful for graphs with multiple edges::

            sage: G = Graph([(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 2, 'b')], multiedges=True)
            sage: G.is_tree(certificate=True)
            (False, [1, 2])
            sage: G.is_tree(certificate=True, output='edge')

        Test if the graph is apex.

        A graph is apex if it can be made planar by the removal of a single
        vertex. The deleted vertex is called ``an apex`` of the graph, and a
        graph may have more than one apex. For instance, in the minimal
        nonplanar graphs `K_5` or `K_{3,3}`, every vertex is an apex. The apex
        graphs include graphs that are themselves planar, in which case again
        every vertex is an apex. The null graph is also counted as an apex graph
        even though it has no vertex to remove.  If the graph is not connected,
        we say that it is apex if it has at most one non planar connected
        component and that this component is apex.  See the :wikipedia:`Apex_graph`
        for more information.

        Tests whether the current graph is overfull.

        A graph `G` on `n` vertices and `m` edges is said to be overfull if:

        - `n` is odd

        - It satisfies `2m > (n-1)\Delta(G)`, where `\Delta(G)` denotes the
          maximum degree among all vertices in `G`.

        An overfull graph must have a chromatic index of `\Delta(G)+1`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Even-hole-free graphs always contain a bisimplicial vertex, which

        Tests whether ``self`` contains an induced odd hole.

        A Hole is a cycle of length at least 4 (included). It is said to be even
        (resp. odd) if its length is even (resp. odd).

        It is interesting to notice that while it is polynomial to check whether
        a graph has an odd hole or an odd antihole [CCLSV2005]_, it is not known
        whether testing for one of these two cases independently is polynomial
        too.

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); when ``certificate =
          False``, this method only returns ``True`` or ``False``. If
          ``certificate = True``, the subgraph found is returned instead of
          ``False``.

    def is_split(self):
        r"""
        Returns ``True`` if the graph is a Split graph, ``False`` otherwise.

        A Graph `G` is said to be a split graph if its vertices `V(G)` can be
        partitioned into two sets `K` and `I` such that the vertices of `K`
        induce a complete graph, and those of `I` are an independent set.

        There is a simple test to check whether a graph is a split graph (see,
        for instance, the book "Graph Classes, a survey" [BLS1999]_ page
        203) :

        Given the degree sequence `d_1 \geq ... \geq d_n` of `G`, a graph is a
        split graph if and only if :

        .. MATH::

            \sum_{i=1}^\omega d_i = \omega (\omega - 1) + \sum_{i=\omega + 1}^nd_i

        where `\omega = max \{i:d_i\geq i-1\}`.


        EXAMPLES:

        Split graphs are, in particular, chordal graphs. Hence, The Petersen
        graph can not be split::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().is_split()
            False

        We can easily build some "random" split graph by creating a complete
        graph, and adding vertices only connected to some random vertices of the
        clique::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(10)
            sage: sets = Subsets(Set(range(10)))
            sage: for i in range(10, 25):
            ....:    g.add_edges([(i,k) for k in sets.random_element()])
            sage: g.is_split()
            True

        Another characterisation of split graph states that a graph is a split
        graph if and only if does not contain the 4-cycle, 5-cycle or `2K_2` as
        an induced subgraph. Hence for the above graph we have::

            sage: forbidden_subgraphs = [graphs.CycleGraph(4), graphs.CycleGraph(5), 2 * graphs.CompleteGraph(2)]
            sage: sum(g.subgraph_search_count(H,induced=True) for H in forbidden_subgraphs)

        for i, d in enumerate(degree_sequence):

        Tests whether the graph is perfect.

        A graph `G` is said to be perfect if `\chi(H)=\omega(H)` hold for any
        induced subgraph `H\subseteq_i G` (and so for `G` itself, too), where
        `\chi(H)` represents the chromatic number of `H`, and `\omega(H)` its
        clique number. The Strong Perfect Graph Theorem [CRST2006]_ gives
        another characterization of perfect graphs:

        A graph is perfect if and only if it contains no odd hole (cycle on an
        odd number `k` of vertices, `k>3`) nor any odd antihole (complement of a
        hole) as an induced subgraph.

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return a
          certificate.

        OUTPUT:

        When ``certificate = False``, this function returns a boolean
        value. When ``certificate = True``, it returns a subgraph of ``self``
        isomorphic to an odd hole or an odd antihole if any, and ``None``
        otherwise.

        EXAMPLES:

            sage: g.is_perfect()

            sage: g.line_graph().is_perfect() # long time
            True

        As well as the Cartesian product of two complete graphs::

            sage: g =  graphs.RandomIntervalGraph(7)

            True

        The PetersenGraph, which is triangle-free and has chromatic number 3 is

            sage: g.is_perfect()

    def strong_orientation(self):

        Returns a strongly connected orientation of the current graph.

        An orientation of an undirected graph is a digraph obtained by giving an
        unique direction to each of its edges. An orientation is said to be
        strong if there is a directed path between each pair of vertices.  See
        also the :wikipedia:`Strongly_connected_component`.

        If the graph is 2-edge-connected, a strongly connected orientation
        can be found in linear time. If the given graph is not 2-connected,
        the orientation returned will ensure that each 2-connected component
        has a strongly connected orientation.

        OUTPUT:

        A digraph representing an orientation of the current graph.

        .. NOTE::

            - This method assumes the graph is connected.
            - This algorithm works in O(m).

        EXAMPLES:

        For a 2-regular graph, a strong orientation gives to each vertex an
        out-degree equal to 1::

            sage: g.strong_orientation().out_degree()

        ALGORITHM:

        The problem is solved through a maximum flow :

        Given a graph `G`, we create a ``DiGraph`` `D` defined on `E(G)\cup
        V(G)\cup \{s,t\}`. We then link `s` to all of `V(G)` (these edges having
        a capacity equal to the bound associated to each element of `V(G)`), and
        all the elements of `E(G)` to `t` . We then link each `v \in V(G)` to
        each of its incident edges in `G`. A maximum integer flow of value
        `|E(G)|` corresponds to an admissible orientation of `G`. Otherwise,
        none exists.

        EXAMPLES:

        There is always an orientation of a graph `G` such that a vertex `v` has

        Chvatal's graph, being 4-regular, can be oriented in such a way that its
        maximum out-degree is 2::

            sage: g = graphs.ChvatalGraph()
            sage: D = g.bounded_outdegree_orientation(2)
            sage: max(D.out_degree())
            2

        For any graph `G`, it is possible to compute an orientation such that
        the maximum out-degree is at most the maximum average degree of `G`
        divided by 2. Anything less, though, is impossible.

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(40, .4)
            sage: mad = g.maximum_average_degree()

        Hence this is possible ::

            sage: d = g.bounded_outdegree_orientation(integer_ceil(mad/2))

        While this is not::

            sage: try:
            ....:     g.bounded_outdegree_orientation(integer_ceil(mad/2-1))
            ....:     print("Error")
            ....: except ValueError:
            ....:     pass

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP

        Return a maximum weighted matching of the graph represented by the list

        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Matching_(graph_theory)`.

        Given a graph `G` such that each edge `e` has a weight `w_e`, a maximum
        matching is a subset `S` of the edges of `G` of maximum weight such that
        no two edges of `S` are incident with each other.

        As an optimization problem, it can be expressed as:

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"Edmonds"``)

          - ``"Edmonds"`` selects Edmonds' algorithm as implemented in NetworkX

          - ``"LP"`` uses a Linear Program formulation of the matching problem

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - when set to ``True``, computes a weighted matching where each edge
            is weighted by its label (if an edge has no label, `1` is assumed)

          - when set to ``False``, each edge has weight `1`

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which

          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of verbosity:
          set to 0 by default, which means quiet (only useful when ``algorithm
          == "LP"``)

          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        - When ``value_only=False`` (default), this method returns the list of
          edges of a maximum matching of `G`.

        - When ``value_only=True``, this method returns the sum of the
          weights (default: ``1``) of the edges of a maximum matching of `G`.
          The type of the output may vary according to the type of the edge
          labels and the algorithm used.

        ALGORITHM:

        The problem is solved using Edmond's algorithm implemented in NetworkX,
        or using Linear Programming depending on the value of ``algorithm``.

        Checks whether there is a homomorphism between two graphs.

        A homomorphism from a graph `G` to a graph `H` is a function

        `\phi(u)\phi(v)` is an edge of `H`.

        Saying that a graph can be `k`-colored is equivalent to saying that it
        has a homomorphism to `K_k`, the complete graph on `k` elements.

        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Graph_homomorphism`.

        This method returns ``False`` when the homomorphism does not exist, and
        returns the homomorphism otherwise as a dictionary associating a vertex

        Unlike the average degree, the `Mad` of the disjoint union of two graphs

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        A dictionary associating to each vertex of `H` the set of vertices in
        the current graph representing it.

        ALGORITHM:

        Mixed Integer Linear Programming

        COMPLEXITY:

        Theoretically, when `H` is fixed, testing for the existence of a
        `H`-minor is polynomial. The known algorithms are highly exponential in
        `H`, though.

        .. NOTE::

            This function can be expected to be *very* slow, especially where
            the minor does not exist.

        EXAMPLES:

        Trying to find a minor isomorphic to `K_4` in the `4\times 4` grid::

            sage: g = graphs.GridGraph([4,4])
            sage: h = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
            sage: L = g.minor(h)
            sage: gg = g.subgraph(flatten(L.values(), max_level = 1))
            sage: _ = [gg.merge_vertices(l) for l in L.values() if len(l)>1]
            sage: gg.is_isomorphic(h)
            True

        We can also try to prove this way that the Petersen graph is not planar,
        as it has a `K_5` minor::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: K5_minor = g.minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(5))                    # long time

        And even a `K_{3,3}` minor::

            sage: K33_minor = g.minor(graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,3))        # long time

        (It is much faster to use the linear-time test of planarity in this
        situation, though.)

        As there is no cycle in a tree, looking for a `K_3` minor is useless.
        This function will raise an exception in this case::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(20,.5)
            sage: g = g.subgraph(edges = g.min_spanning_tree())
            sage: g.is_tree()
            True
            sage: L = g.minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(3))

        INPUT:

        - ``v`` - either a single vertex or a list of vertices. If it is not
          specified, then it is taken to be all vertices.

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, edge
          weights are taken into account; if False, all edges have weight 1

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of the following
          algorithms:

          - ``'BFS'`` - the computation is done through a BFS centered on each
            vertex successively. Works only if ``by_weight==False``.

          - ``'DHV'`` - the computation is done using the algorithm proposed in
            [Dragan2018]_. Works only if ``self`` has non-negative edge weights
            and ``v is None`` or ``v`` should contain all vertices of ``self``.

            :func:`sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs.eccentricity` and
            :func:`sage.graphs.base.boost_graph.eccentricity_DHV`.

          - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Cython'`` - a Cython implementation of the
            Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Works only if ``by_weight==False`` and
            ``v is None`` or ``v`` should contain all vertices of ``self``.

          - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Python'`` - a Python implementation of the
            Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Works also with weighted graphs, even with
            negative weights (but no negative cycle is allowed). However, ``v``
            must be ``None`` or ``v`` should contain all vertices of ``self``.

          - ``'Dijkstra_NetworkX'`` - the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in
            NetworkX. It works with weighted graphs, but no negative weight is
            allowed.

          - ``'Dijkstra_Boost'`` - the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in Boost
            (works only with positive weights).

          - ``'Johnson_Boost'`` - the Johnson algorithm, implemented in
            Boost (works also with negative weights, if there is no negative
            cycle). Works only if ``v is None`` or ``v`` should contain all
            vertices of ``self``.

          - ``'From_Dictionary'`` - uses the (already computed) distances, that
            are provided by input variable ``dist_dict``.

          - ``None`` (default): Sage chooses the best algorithm:
            ``'From_Dictionary'`` if ``dist_dict`` is not None, ``'BFS'`` for
            unweighted graphs, ``'Dijkstra_Boost'`` if all weights are
            positive, ``'Johnson_Boost'`` otherwise.

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l`` as a
          weight, if ``l`` is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``check_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, we check
          that the ``weight_function`` outputs a number for each edge

        - ``dist_dict`` -- a dictionary (default: ``None``); a dict of dicts of
          distances (used only if ``algorithm=='From_Dictionary'``)

        - ``with_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return a
          list or a dictionary keyed by vertices.

        Return a topological `H`-minor from ``self`` if one exists.

        We say that a graph `G` has a topological `H`-minor (or that it has a
        graph isomorphic to `H` as a topological minor), if `G` contains a
        subdivision of a graph isomorphic to `H` (i.e.  obtained from `H`
        through arbitrary subdivision of its edges) as a subgraph.

        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Minor_(graph_theory)`.

        INPUT:

        - ``H`` -- The topological minor to find in the current graph.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        The topological `H`-minor found is returned as a subgraph `M` of
        ``self``, such that the vertex `v` of `M` that represents a vertex `h\in
        H` has ``h`` as a label (see :meth:`get_vertex
        <sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.get_vertex>` and
        :meth:`set_vertex <sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.set_vertex>`),
        and such that every edge of `M` has as a label the edge of `H` it
        (partially) represents.

        If no topological minor is found, this method returns ``False``.

        ALGORITHM:

        Mixed Integer Linear Programming.

        COMPLEXITY:

        Theoretically, when `H` is fixed, testing for the existence of a
        topological `H`-minor is polynomial. The known algorithms are highly
        exponential in `H`, though.

        .. NOTE::

            This function can be expected to be *very* slow, especially where
            the topological minor does not exist.

            (CPLEX seems to be *much* more efficient than GLPK on this kind of
            problem)

        Petersen's graph has a topological `K_4`-minor::

    @doc_index("Clique-related methods")
    def cliques_maximal(self, algorithm="native"):
        """
        Return the list of all maximal cliques.

        Each clique is represented by a list of vertices. A clique is an induced
        complete subgraph, and a maximal clique is one not contained in a larger
        one.

        INPUT:

            Sage's implementation of the enumeration of *maximal* independent
            sets is not much faster than NetworkX' (expect a 2x speedup), which
            is surprising as it is written in Cython. This being said, the
            algorithm from NetworkX appears to be slightly different from this
            one, and that would be a good thing to explore if one wants to
            improve the implementation.

        Return a maximum independent set.

        An independent set of a graph is a set of pairwise non-adjacent
        vertices. A maximum independent set is an independent set of maximum
        cardinality.  It induces an empty subgraph.

        Equivalently, an independent set is defined as the complement of a
        vertex cover.

        For more information, see the
        :wikipedia:`Independent_set_(graph_theory)` and the
        :wikipedia:`Vertex_cover`.

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- the algorithm to be used

          * If ``algorithm = "Cliquer"`` (default), the problem is solved
            using Cliquer [NO2003]_.

            (see the :mod:`Cliquer modules <sage.graphs.cliquer>`)

          * If ``algorithm = "MILP"``, the problem is solved through a Mixed
            Integer Linear Program.

            (see :class:`~sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram`)

         * If ``algorithm = "mcqd"``, uses the MCQD solver
           (`<http://www.sicmm.org/~konc/maxclique/>`_). Note that the MCQD
           package must be installed.

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if set to ``True``,
          only the size of a maximum independent set is returned. Otherwise,
          a maximum independent set is returned as a list of vertices.

        - ``reduction_rules`` -- (default: ``True``); specify if the reductions
          rules from kernelization must be applied as pre-processing or not.
          See [ACFLSS04]_ for more details. Note that depending on the instance,
          it might be faster to disable reduction rules.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        .. NOTE::

            While Cliquer/MCAD are usually (and by far) the most efficient
            implementations, the MILP formulation sometimes proves faster on
            very "symmetrical" graphs.

        A minimum vertex cover of a graph is a set `S` of vertices such that

          - ``"Cliquer"`` will compute a minimum vertex cover using the Cliquer
            package.

          - ``"MILP"`` will compute a minimum vertex cover through a mixed

        r"""
        Return an Ear decomposition of the graph.

        An ear of an undirected graph `G` is a path `P` where the two endpoints
        of the path may coincide (i.e., form a cycle), but where otherwise no
        repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal vertex of
        `P` has degree two in `P`.

        An ear decomposition of an undirected graph `G` is a partition of its
        set of edges into a sequence of ears, such that the one or two endpoints
        of each ear belong to earlier ears in the sequence and such that the
        internal vertices of each ear do not belong to any earlier ear.

        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Ear_decomposition`.

        This method implements the linear time algorithm presented in
        [Sch2013]_.

        OUTPUT:

        - A nested list representing the cycles and chains of the ear
          decomposition of the graph.

        Return the core number for each vertex in an ordered list.

        (for homomorphisms cores, see the :meth:`Graph.has_homomorphism_to`
        method)

        DEFINITIONS:

        * *K-cores* in graph theory were introduced by Seidman in 1983 and by
          Bollobas in 1984 as a method of (destructively) simplifying graph
          topology to aid in analysis and visualization. They have been more
          recently defined as the following by Batagelj et al:

          *Given a graph `G` with vertices set `V` and edges set `E`, the
          `k`-core of `G` is the graph obtained from `G` by recursively removing
          the vertices with degree less than `k`, for as long as there are any.*

          This operation can be useful to filter or to study some properties of
          the graphs. For instance, when you compute the 2-core of graph G, you
          are cutting all the vertices which are in a tree part of graph.  (A
          tree is a graph with no loops). See the :wikipedia:`K-core`.

          [PSW1996]_ defines a `k`-core of `G` as the largest subgraph (it is
          unique) of `G` with minimum degree at least `k`.

        * Core number of a vertex

          The core number of a vertex `v` is the largest integer `k` such that
          `v` belongs to the `k`-core of `G`.

        * Degeneracy

          The *degeneracy* of a graph `G`, usually denoted `\delta^*(G)`, is the
          smallest integer `k` such that the graph `G` can be reduced to the
          empty graph by iteratively removing vertices of degree `\leq k`.
          Equivalently, `\delta^*(G)=k` if `k` is the smallest integer such that
          the `k`-core of `G` is empty.

        IMPLEMENTATION:

        This implementation is based on the NetworkX implementation of the
        algorithm described in [BZ2003]_.

        INPUT:

        - ``k`` -- integer (default: ``None``);

            * If ``k = None`` (default), returns the core number for each vertex.

            * If ``k`` is an integer, returns a pair ``(ordering, core)``, where
              ``core`` is the list of vertices in the `k`-core of ``self``, and
              ``ordering`` is an elimination order for the other vertices such
              that each vertex is of degree strictly less than `k` when it is to
              be eliminated from the graph.

        - ``with_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); when set to
          ``False``, and ``k = None``, the method returns a list whose `i` th
          element is the core number of the `i` th vertex. When set to ``True``,
          the method returns a dictionary whose keys are vertices, and whose
          values are the corresponding core numbers.

        .. SEEALSO::

           * Graph cores is also a notion related to graph homomorphisms. For
             this second meaning, see :meth:`Graph.has_homomorphism_to`.

    def modular_decomposition(self, algorithm='habib', style='tuple'):
        r"""
        Return the modular decomposition of the current graph.

        A module of an undirected graph is a subset of vertices such that every
        vertex outside the module is either connected to all members of the
        module or to none of them. Every graph that has a nontrivial module can
        be partitioned into modules, and the increasingly fine partitions into
        modules form a tree. The ``modular_decomposition`` function returns
        that tree.

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``'habib'``); specifies the
          algorithm to use among:

          - ``'tedder'`` -- linear time algorithm of [TCHP2008]_

          - ``'habib'`` -- `O(n^3)` algorithm of [HM1979]_. This algorithm is
            much simpler and so possibly less prone to errors.

        - ``style`` -- string (default: ``'tuple'``); specifies the output
          format:

          - ``'tuple'`` -- as nested tuples.

          - ``'tree'`` -- as :class:`~sage.combinat.rooted_tree.LabelledRootedTree`.

        OUTPUT:

        A pair of two values (recursively encoding the decomposition) :

        * The type of the current module :

          * ``"PARALLEL"``
          * ``"PRIME"``
          * ``"SERIES"``

        * The list of submodules (as list of pairs ``(type, list)``,
          recursively...) or the vertex's name if the module is a singleton.

        Crash course on modular decomposition:

        A module `M` of a graph `G` is a proper subset of its vertices such
        that for all `u \in V(G)-M, v,w\in M` the relation `u \sim v
        \Leftrightarrow u \sim w` holds, where `\sim` denotes the adjacency
        relation in `G`. Equivalently, `M \subset V(G)` is a module if all its
        vertices have the same adjacency relations with each vertex outside of
        the module (vertex by vertex).

        Hence, for a set like a module, it is very easy to encode the
        information of the adjacencies between the vertices inside and outside
        the module -- we can actually add a new vertex `v_M` to our graph
        representing our module `M`, and let `v_M` be adjacent to `u\in V(G)-M`
        if and only if some `v\in M` (and hence all the vertices contained in
        the module) is adjacent to `u`. We can now independently (and
        recursively) study the structure of our module `M` and the new graph
        `G-M+\{v_M\}`, without any loss of information.

        Here are two very simple modules :

        * A connected component `C` (or the union of some --but not all-- of
          them) of a disconnected graph `G`, for instance, is a module, as no
          vertex of `C` has a neighbor outside of it.

        * An anticomponent `C` (or the union of some --but not all-- of them) of
          an non-anticonnected graph `G`, for the same reason (it is just the
          complement of the previous graph !).

        These modules being of special interest, the disjoint union of graphs is
        called a Parallel composition, and the complement of a disjoint union is
        called a Series composition. A graph whose only modules are singletons
        is called Prime.

        For more information on modular decomposition, in particular for an
        explanation of the terms "Parallel," "Prime" and "Series," see the
        :wikipedia:`Modular_decomposition`.

        You may also be interested in the survey from Michel Habib and
        Christophe Paul entitled "A survey on Algorithmic aspects of modular
        decomposition" [HP2010]_.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Bull Graph is prime::

            sage: graphs.BullGraph().modular_decomposition()
            (PRIME, [1, 2, 0, 3, 4])

        The Petersen Graph too::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().modular_decomposition()
            (PRIME, [1, 4, 5, 0, 2, 6, 3, 7, 8, 9])

        This a clique on 5 vertices with 2 pendant edges, though, has a more
        interesting decomposition::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
            sage: g.add_edge(0,5)
            sage: g.add_edge(0,6)
            sage: g.modular_decomposition(algorithm='habib')
            (SERIES, [(PARALLEL, [(SERIES, [1, 2, 3, 4]), 5, 6]), 0])

        We get an equivalent tree when we use the algorithm of [TCHP2008]_::

            sage: g.modular_decomposition(algorithm='tedder')
            (SERIES, [(PARALLEL, [(SERIES, [4, 3, 2, 1]), 5, 6]), 0])

        We can choose output to be a
        :class:`~sage.combinat.rooted_tree.LabelledRootedTree`::

            sage: g.modular_decomposition(style='tree')
            SERIES[0[], PARALLEL[5[], 6[], SERIES[1[], 2[], 3[], 4[]]]]
            sage: ascii_art(g.modular_decomposition(style='tree'))
              __SERIES
             /      /
            0   ___PARALLEL
               / /     /
              5 6   __SERIES
                   / / / /
                  1 2 3 4

        ALGORITHM:

        When ``algorithm='tedder'`` this function uses python implementation of
        algorithm published by Marc Tedder, Derek Corneil, Michel Habib and
        Christophe Paul [TCHP2008]_. When ``algorithm='habib'`` this function
        uses the algorithm of M. Habib and M. Maurer [HM1979]_.

        Test whether the graph is the graph of an inscribed polyhedron.

        A polyhedron is inscribed if all of its vertices are on a sphere.
        This is dual to the notion of circumscribed polyhedron: A Polyhedron is
        inscribed if and only if its polar dual is circumscribed and hence a
        graph is inscribable if and only if its planar dual is circumscribable.

        it is the minimal label on the edges of the unique path between them.

        Given a graph `G`, a Gomory-Hu tree `T` of `G` is a tree with the same

        is the same in `G` as in `T`. See the :wikipedia:`Gomory–Hu_tree`. Note

        ALGORITHM:

            This is computed here using a determinant, as explained in Section
            3.1 of [Mar2009a]_.

            As an intermediate step, one computes a cycle basis `\mathcal C` of
            `G` and a rectangular `|\mathcal C| \times |E(G)|` matrix with
            entries in `\{-1,0,1\}`, which describes which edge belong to which
            cycle of `\mathcal C` and their respective orientations.

            More precisely, after fixing an arbitrary orientation for each edge
            `e\in E(G)` and each cycle `C\in\mathcal C`, one gets a sign for
            every incident pair (edge, cycle) which is `1` if the orientation
            coincide and `-1` otherwise.

    def magnitude_function(self):
        r"""
        Return the magnitude function of the graph as a rational function.

        This is defined as the sum of all coefficients in the inverse of the
        matrix `Z` whose coefficient `Z_{i,j}` indexed by a pair of vertices
        `(i,j)` is `q^d(i,j)` where `d` is the distance function in the graph.

        By convention, if the distance from `i` to `j` is infinite (for two
        vertices not path connected) then `Z_{i,j}=0`.

        The value of the magnitude function at `q=0` is the cardinality of the
        graph. The magnitude function of a disjoint union is the sum of the
        magnitudes functions of the connected components. The magnitude function
        of a Cartesian product is the product of the magnitudes functions of the
        factors.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: g = Graph({1:[], 2:[]})
            sage: g.magnitude_function()
            2

            sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
            sage: g.magnitude_function()

            sage: m = g.magnitude_function(); m
            5/(2*q^2 + 2*q + 1)

        One can expand the magnitude as a power series in `q` as follows::

            sage: q = QQ[['q']].gen()
            sage: m(q)
            5 - 10*q + 10*q^2 - 20*q^4 + 40*q^5 - 40*q^6 + ...

        One can also use the substitution `q = exp(-t)` to obtain the magnitude
        function as a function of `t`::

            sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(6)
            sage: m = g.magnitude_function()
            sage: t = var('t')                                                  # optional - sage.symbolic
            sage: m(exp(-t))                                                    # optional - sage.symbolic
            6/(2*e^(-t) + 2*e^(-2*t) + e^(-3*t) + 1)

        Compute the inverse of the Ihara zeta function of the graph.

        This is a polynomial in one variable with integer coefficients. The
        Ihara zeta function itself is the inverse of this polynomial.

        See the :wikipedia:`Ihara zeta function` for more information.

        ALGORITHM:

        This is computed here as the (reversed) characteristic polynomial of a
        square matrix of size twice the number of edges, related to the
        adjacency matrix of the line graph, see for example Proposition 9 in
        [SS2008]_ and Def. 4.1 in [Ter2011]_.
