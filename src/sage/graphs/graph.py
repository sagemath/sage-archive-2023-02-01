Graph Format
------------

Supported formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sage Graphs can be created from a wide range of inputs. A few
examples are covered here.


-  NetworkX dictionary format:

   ::

       sage: d = {0: [1,4,5], 1: [2,6], 2: [3,7], 3: [4,8], 4: [9], \
             5: [7, 8], 6: [8,9], 7: [9]}
       sage: G = Graph(d); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()

-  A NetworkX graph:

   ::

       sage: import networkx
       sage: K = networkx.complete_bipartite_graph(12,7)
       sage: G = Graph(K)
       sage: G.degree()
       [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12]

-  graph6 or sparse6 format:

   ::

       sage: s = ':I`AKGsaOs`cI]Gb~'
       sage: G = Graph(s, sparse=True); G
       Looped multi-graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()

   Note that the ``\`` character is an escape character in Python, and
   also a character used by graph6 strings:

   ::

       sage: G = Graph('Ihe\n@GUA')
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       RuntimeError: The string (Ihe) seems corrupt: for n = 10, the string is too short.

   In Python, the escaped character ``\`` is represented by ``\\``:

   ::

       sage: G = Graph('Ihe\\n@GUA')
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()

-  adjacency matrix: In an adjacency matrix, each column and each
   row represent a vertex. If a 1 shows up in row `i`, column
   `j`, there is an edge `(i,j)`.

   ::

       sage: M = Matrix([(0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0),(1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0), \
       (0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0),(1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1), \
       (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0), (0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1),(0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1), \
       (0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0), (0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0)])
       sage: M
       [0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
       [1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
       [0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0]
       [0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0]
       [1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]
       [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
       [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
       [0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
       [0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0]
       [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0]
       sage: G = Graph(M); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()

-  incidence matrix: In an incidence matrix, each row represents a
   vertex and each column represents an edge.

   ::

       sage: M = Matrix([(-1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0), \
       (1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0),(0,1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0), \
       (0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0),(0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1), \
       (0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0),(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,0), \
       (0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0),(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,1,0), \
       (0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)])
       sage: M
       [-1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0  0]
       [ 1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0]
       [ 0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0]
       [ 0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0]
       [ 0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 -1]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0  1  1  0  0  0  0]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  1  0  0  0]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  1  0]
       [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1]
       sage: G = Graph(M); G
       Graph on 10 vertices
       sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()
       sage: DiGraph(matrix(2,[0,0,-1,1]), format="incidence_matrix")
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       ValueError: There must be two nonzero entries (-1 & 1) per column.

-  a list of edges::

       sage: g = Graph([(1,3),(3,8),(5,2)])
       sage: g
       Graph on 5 vertices

Generators
----------

If you wish to iterate through all the isomorphism types of graphs,
type, for example::

    sage: for g in graphs(4):
    ...     print g.spectrum()
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
    [1, 0, 0, -1]
    [1.4142135623..., 0, 0, -1.4142135623...]
    [2, 0, -1, -1]
    [1.7320508075..., 0, 0, -1.7320508075...]
    [1, 1, -1, -1]
    [1.6180339887..., 0.6180339887..., -0.6180339887..., -1.6180339887...]
    [2.1700864866..., 0.3111078174..., -1, -1.4811943040...]
    [2, 0, 0, -2]
    [2.5615528128..., 0, -1, -1.5615528128...]
    [3, -1, -1, -1]

For some commonly used graphs to play with, type

::

    sage: graphs.[tab]          # not tested

and hit {tab}. Most of these graphs come with their own custom
plot, so you can see how people usually visualize these graphs.

::

    sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: G.plot().show()    # or G.show()
    sage: G.degree_histogram()
    [0, 0, 0, 10]
    sage: G.adjacency_matrix()
    [0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
    [1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0]
    [1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
    [0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0]

::

    sage: S = G.subgraph([0,1,2,3])
    sage: S.plot().show()    # or S.show()
    sage: S.density()
    1/2

::

    sage: G = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'], num_vertices=7, diameter=5)
    sage: L = G.get_graphs_list()
    sage: graphs_list.show_graphs(L)

.. _Graph:labels:

Labels
------

Each vertex can have any hashable object as a label. These are
things like strings, numbers, and tuples. Each edge is given a
default label of ``None``, but if specified, edges can
have any label at all. Edges between vertices `u` and
`v` are represented typically as ``(u, v, l)``, where
``l`` is the label for the edge.

Note that vertex labels themselves cannot be mutable items::

    sage: M = Matrix( [[0,0],[0,0]] )
    sage: G = Graph({ 0 : { M : None } })
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable

However, if one wants to define a dictionary, with the same keys
and arbitrary objects for entries, one can make that association::

    sage: d = {0 : graphs.DodecahedralGraph(), 1 : graphs.FlowerSnark(), \
          2 : graphs.MoebiusKantorGraph(), 3 : graphs.PetersenGraph() }
    sage: d[2]
    Moebius-Kantor Graph: Graph on 16 vertices
    sage: T = graphs.TetrahedralGraph()
    sage: T.vertices()
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
    sage: T.set_vertices(d)
    sage: T.get_vertex(1)
    Flower Snark: Graph on 20 vertices

Database
--------

There is a database available for searching for graphs that satisfy
a certain set of parameters, including number of vertices and
edges, density, maximum and minimum degree, diameter, radius, and
connectivity. To see a list of all search parameter keywords broken
down by their designated table names, type

::

    sage: graph_db_info()
    {...}

For more details on data types or keyword input, enter

::

    sage: GraphQuery?    # not tested

The results of a query can be viewed with the show method, or can be
viewed individually by iterating through the results:

::

    sage: Q = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'],num_vertices=7, diameter=5)
    sage: Q.show()
    Graph6
    --------------------
    F?`po
    F?gqg
    F@?]O
    F@OKg
    F@R@o
    FA_pW
    FEOhW
    FGC{o
    FIAHo

Show each graph as you iterate through the results:

::

    sage: for g in Q:
    ...     show(g)

Visualization
-------------

To see a graph `G` you are working with, there
are three main options. You can view the graph in two dimensions via
matplotlib with ``show()``. ::

    sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(15,.3)
    sage: G.show()

And you can view it in three dimensions via jmol with ``show3d()``. ::

    sage: G.show3d()

Or it can be rendered with `\LaTeX`.  This requires the right
additions to a standard `\mbox{\rm\TeX}` installation.  Then standard
Sage commands, such as ``view(G)`` will display the graph, or
``latex(G)`` will produce a string suitable for inclusion in a
`\LaTeX` document.  More details on this are at
the :mod:`sage.graphs.graph_latex` module. ::

    sage: from sage.graphs.graph_latex import check_tkz_graph
    sage: check_tkz_graph()  # random - depends on TeX installation
    sage: latex(G)
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    ...
    \end{tikzpicture}

Mutability
----------

Graphs are mutable, and thus unusable as dictionary keys, unless
``data_structure="static_sparse"`` is used::

    sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: {G:1}[G]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. Create an immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`
    sage: G_immutable = Graph(G, immutable=True)
    sage: G_immutable == G
    True
    sage: {G_immutable:1}[G_immutable]
    1

    Undirected graph.

    A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges. See also the
    :wikipedia:`Wikipedia article on graphs <Graph_(mathematics)>`.

    One can very easily create a graph in Sage by typing::

        sage: g = Graph()

    By typing the name of the graph, one can get some basic information
    about it::

        sage: g
        Graph on 0 vertices

    This graph is not very interesting as it is by default the empty graph.
    But Sage contains a large collection of pre-defined graph classes that
    can be listed this way:

    * Within a Sage session, type ``graphs.``
      (Do not press "Enter", and do not forget the final period ".")

    * Hit "tab".

    You will see a list of methods which will construct named graphs. For
    example::

        sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: g.plot()

    or::

        sage: g = graphs.ChvatalGraph()
        sage: g.plot()

    In order to obtain more information about these graph constructors, access
    the documentation using the command ``graphs.RandomGNP?``.

    Once you have defined the graph you want, you can begin to work on it
    by using the almost 200 functions on graphs in the Sage library!
    If your graph is named ``g``, you can list these functions as previously
    this way

    * Within a Sage session, type ``g.``
      (Do not press "Enter", and do not forget the final period "." )

    * Hit "tab".

    As usual, you can get some information about what these functions do by
    typing (e.g. if you want to know about the ``diameter()`` method)
    ``g.diameter?``.

    If you have defined a graph ``g`` having several connected components
    (i.e. ``g.is_connected()`` returns False), you can print each one of its
    connected components with only two lines::

        sage: for component in g.connected_components():
        ...      g.subgraph(component).plot()


    INPUT:

    -  ``data`` -- can be any of the following (see the ``format`` argument):

      #.  An integer specifying the number of vertices

      #.  A dictionary of dictionaries

      #.  A dictionary of lists

      #.  A NumPy matrix or ndarray

      #.  A Sage adjacency matrix or incidence matrix

      #.  A pygraphviz graph

      #.  A SciPy sparse matrix

      #.  A NetworkX graph

    -  ``pos`` -  a positioning dictionary: for example, the
       spring layout from NetworkX for the 5-cycle is::

         {0: [-0.91679746, 0.88169588],
          1: [ 0.47294849, 1.125     ],
          2: [ 1.125     ,-0.12867615],
          3: [ 0.12743933,-1.125     ],
          4: [-1.125     ,-0.50118505]}

    -  ``name`` - (must be an explicitly named parameter,
       i.e., ``name="complete")`` gives the graph a name

    -  ``loops`` - boolean, whether to allow loops (ignored
       if data is an instance of the ``Graph`` class)

    -  ``multiedges`` - boolean, whether to allow multiple
       edges (ignored if data is an instance of the ``Graph`` class)

    -  ``weighted`` - whether graph thinks of itself as
       weighted or not. See ``self.weighted()``

    -  ``format`` - if None, Graph tries to guess- can be
       several values, including:

       -  ``'int'`` - an integer specifying the number of vertices in an
          edge-free graph with vertices labelled from 0 to n-1

       -  ``'graph6'`` - Brendan McKay's graph6 format, in a
          string (if the string has multiple graphs, the first graph is
          taken)

       -  ``'sparse6'`` - Brendan McKay's sparse6 format, in a
          string (if the string has multiple graphs, the first graph is
          taken)

       -  ``'adjacency_matrix'`` - a square Sage matrix M,
          with M[i,j] equal to the number of edges {i,j}

       -  ``'weighted_adjacency_matrix'`` - a square Sage
          matrix M, with M[i,j] equal to the weight of the single edge {i,j}.
          Given this format, weighted is ignored (assumed True).

       -  ``'incidence_matrix'`` - a Sage matrix, with one
          column C for each edge, where if C represents {i, j}, C[i] is -1
          and C[j] is 1

       -  ``'elliptic_curve_congruence'`` - data must be an
          iterable container of elliptic curves, and the graph produced has
          each curve as a vertex (it's Cremona label) and an edge E-F
          labelled p if and only if E is congruent to F mod p

       -  ``NX`` - data must be a NetworkX Graph.

           .. NOTE::

               As Sage's default edge labels is ``None`` while NetworkX uses
               ``{}``, the ``{}`` labels of a NetworkX graph are automatically
               set to ``None`` when it is converted to a Sage graph. This
               behaviour can be overruled by setting the keyword
               ``convert_empty_dict_labels_to_None`` to ``False`` (it is
               ``True`` by default).

    -  ``boundary`` - a list of boundary vertices, if
       empty, graph is considered as a 'graph without boundary'

    -  ``implementation`` - what to use as a backend for
       the graph. Currently, the options are either 'networkx' or
       'c_graph'

    - ``sparse`` (boolean) -- ``sparse=True`` is an alias for
      ``data_structure="sparse"``, and ``sparse=False`` is an alias for
      ``data_structure="dense"``.

    -  ``data_structure`` -- one of the following

       * ``"dense"`` -- selects the :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.dense_graph`
         backend.

       * ``"sparse"`` -- selects the :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph`
         backend.

       * ``"static_sparse"`` -- selects the
         :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend` (this backend is faster
         than the sparse backend and smaller in memory, and it is immutable, so
         that the resulting graphs can be used as dictionary keys).

       *Only available when* ``implementation == 'c_graph'``

    - ``immutable`` (boolean) -- whether to create a immutable graph. Note that
      ``immutable=True`` is actually a shortcut for
      ``data_structure='static_sparse'``. Set to ``False`` by default, only
      available when ``implementation='c_graph'``

    -  ``vertex_labels`` - only for implementation == 'c_graph'.
       Whether to allow any object as a vertex (slower), or
       only the integers 0, ..., n-1, where n is the number of vertices.

    -  ``convert_empty_dict_labels_to_None`` - this arguments sets
       the default edge labels used by NetworkX (empty dictionaries)
       to be replaced by None, the default Sage edge label. It is
       set to ``True`` iff a NetworkX graph is on the input.

    EXAMPLES:

    We illustrate the first seven input formats (the other two
    involve packages that are currently not standard in Sage):

    #. An integer giving the number of vertices::

        sage: g = Graph(5); g
        Graph on 5 vertices
        sage: g.vertices()
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        sage: g.edges()
        []

    #. A dictionary of dictionaries::

        sage: g = Graph({0:{1:'x',2:'z',3:'a'}, 2:{5:'out'}}); g
        Graph on 5 vertices

       The labels ('x', 'z', 'a', 'out') are labels for edges. For
       example, 'out' is the label for the edge on 2 and 5. Labels can be
       used as weights, if all the labels share some common parent.

       ::

        sage: a,b,c,d,e,f = sorted(SymmetricGroup(3))
        sage: Graph({b:{d:'c',e:'p'}, c:{d:'p',e:'c'}})
        Graph on 4 vertices

    #. A dictionary of lists::

        sage: g = Graph({0:[1,2,3], 2:[4]}); g
        Graph on 5 vertices

    #. A list of vertices and a function describing adjacencies. Note
       that the list of vertices and the function must be enclosed in a
       list (i.e., [list of vertices, function]).

       Construct the Paley graph over GF(13).

       ::

          sage: g.adjacency_matrix()
          [0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1]
          [1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]

    #. A Sage matrix:
       Note: If format is not specified, then Sage assumes a symmetric square
       matrix is an adjacency matrix, otherwise an incidence matrix.

    ### Properties
    def is_tree(self, certificate=False, output='vertex'):
        """
        Tests if the graph is a tree

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` (boolean) -- whether to return a certificate. The
          method only returns boolean answers when ``certificate = False``
          (default). When it is set to ``True``, it either answers ``(True,
          None)`` when the graph is a tree and ``(False, cycle)`` when it
          contains a cycle. It returns ``(False, None)`` when the graph is not
          connected.

        - ``output`` (``'vertex'`` (default) or ``'edge'``) -- whether the
          certificate is given as a list of vertices or a list of
          edges.

        When the certificate cycle is given as a list of edges, the
        edges are given as `(v_i, v_{i+1}, l)` where `v_1, v_2, \dots,
        v_n` are the vertices of the cycles (in their cyclic order).

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: all(T.is_tree() for T in graphs.trees(15))
            True

        The empty graph is not considered to be a tree::

            sage: graphs.EmptyGraph().is_tree()
            False

        With certificates::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomTree(30)
            sage: g.is_tree(certificate=True)
            (True, None)
            sage: g.add_edge(10,-1)
            sage: g.add_edge(11,-1)
            sage: isit, cycle = g.is_tree(certificate=True)
            sage: isit
            False
            sage: -1 in cycle
            True

        One can also ask for the certificate as a list of edges::

            sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
            sage: g.is_tree(certificate=True, output='edge')
            (False, [(3, 2, None), (2, 1, None), (1, 0, None), (0, 3, None)])

        This is useful for graphs with multiple edges::

            sage: G = Graph([(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 2, 'b')])
            sage: G.is_tree(certificate=True)
            (False, [1, 2])
            sage: G.is_tree(certificate=True, output='edge')
            (False, [(1, 2, 'a'), (2, 1, 'b')])

    def is_split(self):

        Returns ``True`` if the graph is a Split graph, ``False`` otherwise.

        A Graph `G` is said to be a split graph if its vertices `V(G)`
        can be partitioned into two sets `K` and `I` such that the
        vertices of `K` induce a complete graph, and those of `I` are
        an independent set.

        There is a simple test to check whether a graph is a split
        graph (see, for instance, the book "Graph Classes, a survey"
        [GraphClasses]_ page 203) :

        Given the degree sequence `d_1 \geq ... \geq d_n` of `G`, a graph
        is a split graph if and only if :

        .. MATH::

            \sum_{i=1}^\omega d_i = \omega (\omega - 1) + \sum_{i=\omega + 1}^nd_i

        where `\omega = max \{i:d_i\geq i-1\}`.


        EXAMPLES:

        Split graphs are, in particular, chordal graphs. Hence, The Petersen graph
        can not be split::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().is_split()
            False

        We can easily build some "random" split graph by creating a
        complete graph, and adding vertices only connected
        to some random vertices of the clique::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(10)
            sage: sets = Subsets(Set(range(10)))
            sage: for i in range(10, 25):
            ...      g.add_edges([(i,k) for k in sets.random_element()])
            sage: g.is_split()
            True

        Another caracterisation of split graph states that a graph is a split graph
        if and only if does not contain the 4-cycle, 5-cycle or 2K_2 as an induced
        subgraph. Hence for the above graph we have::

            sage: sum([g.subgraph_search_count(H,induced=True) for H in [graphs.CycleGraph(4),graphs.CycleGraph(5), 2*graphs.CompleteGraph(2)]])

        Graph Theorem [SPGT]_ gives another characterization of
        perfect graphs:

        A graph is perfect if and only if it contains no odd hole
        (cycle on an odd number `k` of vertices, `k>3`) nor any odd
        antihole (complement of a hole) as an induced subgraph.

        OUTPUT:

        When ``certificate = False``, this function returns
        a boolean value. When ``certificate = True``, it returns

    ### Orientations

    def strong_orientation(self):
        r"""
        Returns a strongly connected orientation of the current graph. See
        also the :wikipedia:`Strongly_connected_component`.

        An orientation of an undirected graph is a digraph obtained by
        giving an unique direction to each of its edges. An orientation
        is said to be strong if there is a directed path between each
        pair of vertices.

        If the graph is 2-edge-connected, a strongly connected orientation
        can be found in linear time. If the given graph is not 2-connected,
        the orientation returned will ensure that each 2-connected component
        has a strongly connected orientation.

        OUTPUT:

        A digraph representing an orientation of the current graph.

        .. NOTE::

            - This method assumes the graph is connected.
            - This algorithm works in O(m).

        EXAMPLE:

        For a 2-regular graph, a strong orientation gives to each vertex
        an out-degree equal to 1::

            sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
            sage: g.strong_orientation().out_degree()
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

        The Petersen Graph is 2-edge connected. It then has a strongly
        connected orientation::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: o = g.strong_orientation()
            sage: len(o.strongly_connected_components())
            1

        The same goes for the CubeGraph in any dimension ::

            sage: all(len(graphs.CubeGraph(i).strong_orientation().strongly_connected_components()) == 1 for i in xrange(2,6))
            True

        A multigraph also has a strong orientation ::

            sage: g = Graph([(1,2),(1,2)])

        Returns an orientation of ``self`` with the smallest possible maximum
        outdegree.

        Given a Graph `G`, is is polynomial to compute an orientation
        `D` of the edges of `G` such that the maximum out-degree in
        `D` is minimized. This problem, though, is NP-complete in the
        weighted case [AMOZ06]_.

        INPUT:

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - When set to ``True``, uses edge labels as weights to
            compute the orientation and assumes a weight of `1`
            when there is no value available for a given edge.

          - When set to ``False`` (default), gives a weight of 1
            to all the edges.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        EXAMPLE:

        Given a complete bipartite graph `K_{n,m}`, the maximum out-degree
        of an optimal orientation is `\left\lceil \frac {nm} {n+m}\right\rceil`::

             * An integer `k`. In this case, computes an orientation

             * A dictionary associating to each vertex its associated
               maximum out-degree.

             * A function associating to each vertex its associated
               maximum out-degree.

        OUTPUT:

        A DiGraph representing the orientation if it exists. A
        ``ValueError`` exception is raised otherwise.

        ALGORITHM:

        The problem is solved through a maximum flow :

        Given a graph `G`, we create a ``DiGraph`` `D` defined on
        `E(G)\cup V(G)\cup \{s,t\}`. We then link `s` to all of `V(G)`
        (these edges having a capacity equal to the bound associated
        to each element of `V(G)`), and all the elements of `E(G)` to
        `t` . We then link each `v \in V(G)` to each of its incident
        edges in `G`. A maximum integer flow of value `|E(G)|`
        corresponds to an admissible orientation of `G`. Otherwise,
        none exists.

        EXAMPLES:

        There is always an orientation of a graph `G` such that a
        vertex `v` has out-degree at most `\lceil \frac {d(v)} 2
        \rceil`::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(40, .4)
            sage: b = lambda v : ceil(g.degree(v)/2)
            sage: D = g.bounded_outdegree_orientation(b)
            sage: all( D.out_degree(v) <= b(v) for v in g )
            True


        Chvatal's graph, being 4-regular, can be oriented in such a
        way that its maximum out-degree is 2::

            sage: g = graphs.ChvatalGraph()
            sage: D = g.bounded_outdegree_orientation(2)
            sage: max(D.out_degree())
            2

        For any graph `G`, it is possible to compute an orientation
        such that the maximum out-degree is at most the maximum
        average degree of `G` divided by 2. Anything less, though, is
        impossible.

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(40, .4)
            sage: mad = g.maximum_average_degree()

        Hence this is possible ::

            sage: d = g.bounded_outdegree_orientation(ceil(mad/2))

        While this is not::

            sage: try:
            ...      g.bounded_outdegree_orientation(ceil(mad/2-1))
            ...      print "Error"
            ... except ValueError:
            ...       pass

        a maximum matching is a subset `S` of the edges of `G` of
        maximum weight such that no two edges of `S` are incident
        with each other.

        As an optimization problem, it can be expressed as:

        .. math::

            \mbox{Maximize : }&\sum_{e\in G.edges()} w_e b_e\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\forall v \in G, \sum_{(u,v)\in G.edges()} b_{(u,v)}\leq 1\\
            &\forall x\in G, b_x\mbox{ is a binary variable}

        INPUT:

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to
          ``True``, only the cardinal (or the weight) of the matching is
          returned.

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"Edmonds"``)

          - ``"Edmonds"`` selects Edmonds' algorithm as implemented in NetworkX

          - ``"LP"`` uses a Linear Program formulation of the matching problem

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - When set to ``True``, computes a weighted matching where each edge
            is weighted by its label. (If an edge has no label, `1` is assumed.)

          - When set to ``False``, each edge has weight `1`.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.
          Only useful when ``algorithm == "LP"``.

        ALGORITHM:

        The problem is solved using Edmond's algorithm implemented in
        NetworkX, or using Linear Programming depending on the value of
        ``algorithm``.

        EXAMPLES:

        Maximum matching in a Pappus Graph::

           sage: g = graphs.PappusGraph()
           sage: g.matching(value_only=True)

        Checks whether there is a homomorphism between two graphs.

        A homomorphism from a graph `G` to a graph `H` is a function
        `\phi:V(G)\mapsto V(H)` such that for any edge `uv \in E(G)` the pair
        `\phi(u)\phi(v)` is an edge of `H`.

        Saying that a graph can be `k`-colored is equivalent to saying that it
        has a homomorphism to `K_k`, the complete graph on `k` elements.

        For more information, see the `Wikipedia article on graph homomorphisms
        <Graph_homomorphism>`_.

        INPUT:

        - ``H`` -- the graph to which ``self`` should be sent.

        - ``core`` (boolean) -- whether to minimize the size of the mapping's
          image (see note below). This is set to ``False`` by default.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        .. NOTE::

           One can compute the core of a graph (with respect to homomorphism)

               The size of the core is 2

        OUTPUT:

        This method returns ``False`` when the homomorphism does not exist, and
        returns the homomorphism otherwise as a dictionnary associating a vertex
        of `H` to a vertex of `G`.

          `i^{\mbox{th}}` element of the ``family`` list. If there is no ISR,
          ``None`` is returned.

        For a bipartite graph missing one edge, the solution is as expected::

        The Petersen Graph is 3-colorable, which can be expressed as an
        independent set of representatives problem : take 3 disjoint copies
        of the Petersen Graph, each one representing one color. Then take
        as a partition of the set of vertices the family defined by the three
        copies of each vertex. The ISR of such a family
        defines a 3-coloring::

            sage: g = 3 * graphs.PetersenGraph()

    def minor(self, H, solver=None, verbose=0):
        r"""
        Returns the vertices of a minor isomorphic to `H` in the current graph.

        We say that a graph `G` has a `H`-minor (or that it has
        a graph isomorphic to `H` as a minor), if for all `h\in H`,
        there exist disjoint sets `S_h \subseteq V(G)` such that
        once the vertices of each `S_h` have been merged to create
        a new graph `G'`, this new graph contains `H` as a subgraph.

        For more information, see the
        `Wikipedia article on graph minor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_%28graph_theory%29>`_.

        INPUT:

        - ``H`` -- The minor to find for in the current graph.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        OUTPUT:

        A dictionary associating to each vertex of `H` the set of vertices
        in the current graph representing it.

        ALGORITHM:

        Mixed Integer Linear Programming

        COMPLEXITY:

        Theoretically, when `H` is fixed, testing for the existence of
        a `H`-minor is polynomial. The known algorithms are highly
        exponential in `H`, though.

        .. NOTE::

            This function can be expected to be *very* slow, especially
            where the minor does not exist.

        EXAMPLES:

        Trying to find a minor isomorphic to `K_4` in
        the `4\times 4` grid::

            sage: g = graphs.GridGraph([4,4])
            sage: h = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
            sage: L = g.minor(h)
            sage: gg = g.subgraph(flatten(L.values(), max_level = 1))
            sage: _ = [gg.merge_vertices(l) for l in L.values() if len(l)>1]
            sage: gg.is_isomorphic(h)
            True

        We can also try to prove this way that the Petersen graph
        is not planar, as it has a `K_5` minor::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: K5_minor = g.minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(5))                    # long time

        And even a `K_{3,3}` minor::

            sage: K33_minor = g.minor(graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,3))        # long time

        (It is much faster to use the linear-time test of
        planarity in this situation, though.)

        As there is no cycle in a tree, looking for a `K_3` minor is useless.
        This function will raise an exception in this case::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(20,.5)
            sage: g = g.subgraph(edges = g.min_spanning_tree())

            If you want to compute many convex hulls, keep this object in memory

    ### Centrality

        Returns the betweenness centrality (fraction of number of
        shortest paths that go through each vertex) as a dictionary
        keyed by vertices. The betweenness is normalized by default to
        be in range (0,1). This wraps NetworkX's implementation of the
        algorithm described in [Brandes2003]_.

        Measures of the centrality of a vertex within a graph determine
        the relative importance of that vertex to its graph. Vertices
        that occur on more shortest paths between other vertices have
        higher betweenness than vertices that occur on less.

        INPUT:


        -  ``normalized`` - boolean (default True) - if set to False,
           result is not normalized.

        - ``k`` - integer or None (default None) - if set to an integer,
          use ``k`` node samples to estimate betweenness. Higher values
          give better approximations.

        - ``weight`` - None or string. If set to a string, use that
          attribute of the nodes as weight. ``weight = True`` is
          equivalent to ``weight = "weight"``

    def topological_minor(self, H, vertices = False, paths = False, solver=None, verbose=0):
        r"""
        Returns a topological `H`-minor from ``self`` if one exists.

        We say that a graph `G` has a topological `H`-minor (or that
        it has a graph isomorphic to `H` as a topological minor), if
        `G` contains a subdivision of a graph isomorphic to `H` (=
        obtained from `H` through arbitrary subdivision of its edges)
        as a subgraph.

        For more information, see the `Wikipedia article on graph minor
        :wikipedia:`Minor_(graph_theory)`.

        INPUT:

        - ``H`` -- The topological minor to find in the current graph.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        OUTPUT:

        The topological `H`-minor found is returned as a subgraph `M`
        of ``self``, such that the vertex `v` of `M` that represents a
        vertex `h\in H` has ``h`` as a label (see
        :meth:`get_vertex <sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.get_vertex>`
        and
        :meth:`set_vertex <sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.set_vertex>`),
        and such that every edge of `M` has as a label the edge of `H`
        it (partially) represents.

        If no topological minor is found, this method returns
        ``False``.

        ALGORITHM:

        Mixed Integer Linear Programming.

        COMPLEXITY:

        Theoretically, when `H` is fixed, testing for the existence of
        a topological `H`-minor is polynomial. The known algorithms
        are highly exponential in `H`, though.

        .. NOTE::

            This function can be expected to be *very* slow, especially where
            the topological minor does not exist.

            (CPLEX seems to be *much* more efficient than GLPK on this kind of
            problem)

        EXAMPLES:

        Petersen's graph has a topological `K_4`-minor::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.topological_minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(4))

            Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on ...

        And of course, a tree has no topological `C_3`-minor::

        TESTS:

        The two algorithms should return the same result::

           sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(10,.5)
           sage: vc1 = g.vertex_cover(algorithm="MILP")
           sage: vc2 = g.vertex_cover(algorithm="Cliquer")
           sage: len(vc1) == len(vc2)
           True

        The cardinality of the vertex cover is unchanged when reduction rules are used. First for trees::

           sage: for i in range(20):
           ...       g = graphs.RandomTree(20)
           ...       vc1_set = g.vertex_cover()
           ...       vc1 = len(vc1_set)
           ...       vc2 = g.vertex_cover(value_only = True, reduction_rules = False)
           ...       if vc1 != vc2:
           ...           print "Error :", vc1, vc2
           ...           print "With reduction rules :", vc1
           ...           print "Without reduction rules :", vc2
           ...           break
           ...       g.delete_vertices(vc1_set)
           ...       if g.size() != 0:
           ...           print "This thing is not a vertex cover !"

        Then for random GNP graphs::

           sage: for i in range(20):
           ...       g = graphs.RandomGNP(50,4/50)
           ...       vc1_set = g.vertex_cover()
           ...       vc1 = len(vc1_set)
           ...       vc2 = g.vertex_cover(value_only = True, reduction_rules = False)
           ...       if vc1 != vc2:
           ...           print "Error :", vc1, vc2
           ...           print "With reduction rules :", vc1
           ...           print "Without reduction rules :", vc2
           ...           break
           ...       g.delete_vertices(vc1_set)
           ...       if g.size() != 0:
           ...           print "This thing is not a vertex cover !"

        Testing mcqd::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().vertex_cover(algorithm="mcqd",value_only=True) # optional - mcqd
            6

        Given a wrong algorithm::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().vertex_cover(algorithm = "guess")
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: The algorithm must be "Cliquer" "MILP" or "mcqd".

        **DEFINITIONS**

        * *K-cores* in graph theory were introduced by Seidman in 1983 and by
          Bollobas in 1984 as a method of (destructively) simplifying graph
          topology to aid in analysis and visualization. They have been more
          recently defined as the following by Batagelj et al:

          *Given a graph `G` with vertices set `V` and edges set `E`, the
          `k`-core of `G` is the graph obtained from `G` by recursively removing
          the vertices with degree less than `k`, for as long as there are any.*

          This operation can be useful to filter or to study some properties of
          the graphs. For instance, when you compute the 2-core of graph G, you
          are cutting all the vertices which are in a tree part of graph.  (A
          tree is a graph with no loops). [WPkcore]_

          [PSW1996]_ defines a `k`-core of `G` as the largest subgraph (it is
          unique) of `G` with minimum degree at least `k`.

        * Core number of a vertex

          The core number of a vertex `v` is the largest integer `k` such that
          `v` belongs to the `k`-core of `G`.

        * Degeneracy

          The *degeneracy* of a graph `G`, usually denoted `\delta^*(G)`, is the
          smallest integer `k` such that the graph `G` can be reduced to the
          empty graph by iteratively removing vertices of degree `\leq
          k`. Equivalently, `\delta^*(G)=k` if `k` is the smallest integer such
          that the `k`-core of `G` is empty.

        **IMPLEMENTATION**

        This implementation is based on the NetworkX implementation of
        the algorithm described in [BZ]_.

        **INPUT**

        - ``k`` (integer)

            * If ``k = None`` (default), returns the core number for each vertex.

            * If ``k`` is an integer, returns a pair ``(ordering, core)``, where
              ``core`` is the list of vertices in the `k`-core of ``self``, and
              ``ordering`` is an elimination order for the other vertices such
              that each vertex is of degree strictly less than `k` when it is to
              be eliminated from the graph.

        - ``with_labels`` (boolean)

           * When set to ``False``, and ``k = None``, the method returns a list
             whose `i` th element is the core number of the `i` th vertex. When
             set to ``True``, the method returns a dictionary whose keys are
             vertices, and whose values are the corresponding core numbers.

             By default, ``with_labels = False``.

        .. SEEALSO::

           * Graph cores is also a notion related to graph homomorphisms. For
             this second meaning, see :meth:`Graph.has_homomorphism_to`.

    def modular_decomposition(self):
        r"""
        Returns the modular decomposition of the current graph.

        Crash course on modular decomposition:

        A module `M` of a graph `G` is a proper subset of its vertices
        such that for all `u \in V(G)-M, v,w\in M` the relation `u
        \sim v \Leftrightarrow u \sim w` holds, where `\sim` denotes
        the adjacency relation in `G`. Equivalently, `M \subset V(G)`
        is a module if all its vertices have the same adjacency
        relations with each vertex outside of the module (vertex by
        vertex).

        Hence, for a set like a module, it is very easy to encode the
        information of the adjacencies between the vertices inside and
        outside the module -- we can actually add a new vertex `v_M`
        to our graph representing our module `M`, and let `v_M` be
        adjacent to `u\in V(G)-M` if and only if some `v\in M` (and
        hence all the vertices contained in the module) is adjacent to
        `u`. We can now independently (and recursively) study the
        structure of our module `M` and the new graph `G-M+\{v_M\}`,
        without any loss of information.

        Here are two very simple modules :

            * A connected component `C` (or the union of some --but
              not all-- of them) of a disconnected graph `G`, for
              instance, is a module, as no vertex of `C` has a
              neighbor outside of it.

            * An anticomponent `C` (or the union of some --but not
              all-- of them) of an non-anticonnected graph `G`, for
              the same reason (it is just the complement of the
              previous graph !).

        These modules being of special interest, the disjoint union of
        graphs is called a Parallel composition, and the complement of
        a disjoint union is called a Parallel composition. A graph
        whose only modules are singletons is called Prime.

        For more information on modular decomposition, in particular
        for an explanation of the terms "Parallel," "Prime" and
        "Serie," see the `Wikipedia article on modular decomposition
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_decomposition>`_.

        You may also be interested in the survey from Michel Habib and
        Christophe Paul entitled "A survey on Algorithmic aspects of
        modular decomposition" [HabPau10]_.

        OUTPUT:

        A pair of two values (recursively encoding the decomposition) :

            * The type of the current module :

                * ``"Parallel"``
                * ``"Prime"``
                * ``"Serie"``

            * The list of submodules (as list of pairs ``(type, list)``,
              recursively...) or the vertex's name if the module is a
              singleton.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Bull Graph is prime::

            sage: graphs.BullGraph().modular_decomposition()
            ('Prime', [3, 4, 0, 1, 2])

        The Petersen Graph too::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().modular_decomposition()
            ('Prime', [2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 8, 0, 1, 5, 4])

        This a clique on 5 vertices with 2 pendant edges, though, has a more
        interesting decomposition ::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
            sage: g.add_edge(0,5)
            sage: g.add_edge(0,6)
            sage: g.modular_decomposition()
            ('Serie', [0, ('Parallel', [5, ('Serie', [1, 4, 3, 2]), 6])])

        ALGORITHM:

        This function uses a C implementation of a 2-step algorithm
        implemented by Fabien de Montgolfier [FMDec]_ :

        OUTPUT:

        A graph with labeled edges

        EXAMPLE:

        Taking the Petersen graph::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: t = g.gomory_hu_tree()

        Obviously, this graph is a tree::

            sage: t.is_tree()
            True

        Note that if the original graph is not connected, then the
        Gomory-Hu tree is in fact a forest::

            sage: (2*g).gomory_hu_tree().is_forest()
            True
            sage: (2*g).gomory_hu_tree().is_connected()
            False

        On the other hand, such a tree has lost nothing of the initial
        graph connectedness::

            sage: all([ t.flow(u,v) == g.flow(u,v) for u,v in Subsets( g.vertices(), 2 ) ])
            True

        Just to make sure, we can check that the same is true for two vertices
        in a random graph::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(20,.3)
            sage: t = g.gomory_hu_tree()
            sage: g.flow(0,1) == t.flow(0,1)
            True

        And also the min cut::

            sage: g.edge_connectivity() == min(t.edge_labels())
            True
        """
        return self._gomory_hu_tree(method=method)

    def two_factor_petersen(self):
        r"""
        Returns a decomposition of the graph into 2-factors.

        Petersen's 2-factor decomposition theorem asserts that any
        `2r`-regular graph `G` can be decomposed into 2-factors.
        Equivalently, it means that the edges of any `2r`-regular
        graphs can be partitionned in `r` sets `C_1,\dots,C_r` such
        that for all `i`, the set `C_i` is a disjoint union of cycles
        ( a 2-regular graph ).

        As any graph of maximal degree `\Delta` can be completed into
        a regular graph of degree `2\lceil\frac\Delta 2\rceil`, this
        result also means that the edges of any graph of degree `\Delta`
        can be partitionned in `r=2\lceil\frac\Delta 2\rceil` sets
        `C_1,\dots,C_r` such that for all `i`, the set `C_i` is a
        graph of maximal degree `2` ( a disjoint union of paths
        and cycles ).

        EXAMPLE:

        The Complete Graph on `7` vertices is a `6`-regular graph, so it can
        be edge-partitionned into `2`-regular graphs::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(7)
            sage: classes = g.two_factor_petersen()
            sage: for c in classes:

            ...     gg.add_edges(c)
            ...     print max(gg.degree())<=2
            True
            True
            True
            sage: Set(set(classes[0]) | set(classes[1]) | set(classes[2])).cardinality() == g.size()
            True

        Return the Kirchhoff-Symanzik polynomial of a graph.

        This is a polynomial in variables `t_e` (each of them representing an
        edge of the graph `G`) defined as a sum over all spanning trees:

        .. MATH::

            \Psi_G(t) = \sum_{T\subseteq V\\atop{\\text{a spanning tree}}} \prod_{e \\not\in E(T)} t_e

        This is also called the first Symanzik polynomial or the Kirchhoff
        polynomial.

        INPUT:

        - ``name``: name of the variables (default: ``'t'``)

        OUTPUT:

        - a polynomial with integer coefficients

        ALGORITHM:

            This is computed here using a determinant, as explained in Section
            3.1 of [Marcolli2009]_.

            As an intermediate step, one computes a cycle basis `\mathcal C` of
            `G` and a rectangular `|\mathcal C| \\times |E(G)|` matrix with
            entries in `\{-1,0,1\}`, which describes which edge belong to which
            cycle of `\mathcal C` and their respective orientations.

            More precisely, after fixing an arbitrary orientation for each edge
            `e\in E(G)` and each cycle `C\in\mathcal C`, one gets a sign for
            every incident pair (edge, cycle) which is `1` if the orientation
            coincide and `-1` otherwise.

        EXAMPLES:

        For the cycle of length 5::

            sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
            sage: G.kirchhoff_symanzik_polynomial()
            t0 + t1 + t2 + t3 + t4

        One can use another letter for variables::

            sage: G.kirchhoff_symanzik_polynomial(name='u')
            u0 + u1 + u2 + u3 + u4

        For the 'coffee bean' graph::

            sage: G = Graph([(0,1,'a'),(0,1,'b'),(0,1,'c')])
            sage: G.kirchhoff_symanzik_polynomial()
            t0*t1 + t0*t2 + t1*t2

        For the 'parachute' graph::

            sage: G = Graph([(0,2,'a'),(0,2,'b'),(0,1,'c'),(1,2,'d')])

            t0*t1 + t0*t2 + t1*t2 + t1*t3 + t2*t3

        For the complete graph with 4 vertices::

            sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
            sage: G.kirchhoff_symanzik_polynomial()
            t0*t1*t3 + t0*t2*t3 + t1*t2*t3 + t0*t1*t4 + t0*t2*t4 + t1*t2*t4
