scipy: Scientific tools for Python
==================================

Description
-----------

SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
science, and engineering. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which
provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy
library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many
user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for
numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all
popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge.
NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon
by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.
