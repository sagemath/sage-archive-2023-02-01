<H1>jsMath Sample Page</H1>

This is a sample file showing you how to use jsMath to display mathematics
in your web pages.  Be sure you have followed the <A
HREF="http://www.math.union.edu/locate/jsMath/authors/installation.html">installation
instructions</A> before loading this file.  Also, you may need to edit the
<CODE>jsMath/easy/load.js</CODE> file to set the root URL for where jsMath
can be found on your web site.  The rest of this document gives examples of
how to enter mathematics in your pages.  Depending on the settings in
<CODE>jsMath/easy/load.js</CODE>, not all of the mathematics below will be
processed by jsMath.  Experiment with the settings in that file to see how
they work.

<H2>Some mathematics using <CODE>tex2math</CODE></H2>

The easiest way to enter mathematics is to use jsMath's <A
HREF="http://www.math.union.edu/locate/jsMath/authors/tex2math.html">tex2math</A>
plugin to identify the mathematics in your document by looking for <SPAN
class="math">\rm\TeX</SPAN>-like math delimiters.  Here are some math
equations using those markers.  Some inline math: $\sqrt{1-x^2}$ or \(ax^2+bx+c\),
and some displayed math:
$$\int {1\over x}\,dx = \ln(x)+C$$
and
\[\sum_{i=1}^n i = {n(n+1)\over 2}.\]
Note that the first of these will not be processed unless you have enabled
<CODE>processSingleDollars</CODE> in <CODE>jsMath/easy/load.js</CODE>,
which is disabled by default.  That is because a single dollar sign can
appear in normal text (as in "That will cost from <SPAN>$</SPAN>3.50 to
<SPAN>$</SPAN>5.00 to repair"), and you don't want jsMath to try to typeset
the "3.50 to " as mathematics.
<p>

If you enable <CODE>processSingleDollars</CODE>, you might also want to
enable <CODE>fixEscapedDollars</CODE>, so that it is possible to enter
dollar signs by preceding them with a backslash.  Here's one that you can
use to see the results of these settings:  \$ (an escaped dollar) and $x+1$
(not escaped).
<p>

It is also possible to use your own custom delimiters for marking the
mathematics within your pages.  If you uncomment the <CODE>customDelimiters</CODE>
array in <CODE>jsMath/easy/load.js</CODE>, then the following math will be
typeset by jsMath:  some inline math [math]\sin(2\pi x)[/math] and some
display math [display]x={-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\over 2a}.[/display]
You may change the delimiters to nearly anything you want, but they can not
look like HTML tags, since some browsers will eliminate unknown tags, and
jsMath doesn't get to look for the custom delimiters until <I>after</I> the
browser has interpreted the page.
<p>

<DIV CLASS="tex2math_ignore">
You can prevent the <CODE>tex2math</CODE> plugin from processing a portion
of a page by enclosing it in a tag that is of
<CODE>CLASS="tex2math_ignore"</CODE>.  Often, that tag will be a
<CODE>DIV</CODE> or <CODE>SPAN</CODE>, but it can be anything.  This
paragraph is wrapped in a DIV tag with
<CODE>CLASS="tex2math_ignore"</CODE>, and so no math delimiters will be
processed:  $f\colon X\to Y$, \(x^2 \gt 5\), $$1\over 1+x^2$$ and
\[\matrix{a& b\cr c& d}.\]
Note that this includes the processing of escaped dollars (\$) and
custom delimiters ([math]a \mapsto a^2[/math]) as well.
This makes it possible to produce examples of how to enter mathematics on
your site, for instance.
</DIV>
<P>
JsMath will automatically ignore the text within
<CODE>PRE</CODE> tags, so you can easily enter examples that way as well:
<PRE>
   $f\colon X\to Y$, \(x^2 \gt 5\),
   $$1\over 1+x^2$$ and \[\matrix{a& b\cr c& d}.\]
</PRE>
<P>

Note that since the &lt; and &gt; symbols are used to denote HTML tags,
these can be hard to incorporate into your <SPAN CLASS="math">\rm\TeX</SPAN>
code.  Often, putting spaces around the &lt; or &gt; will make it work, but
it is probably better to use <CODE>\lt</CODE> and <CODE>\gt</CODE> instead.
Also note that the <CODE>tex2math</CODE> plugin does not allow any HTML
tags to be within the math delimiters, with the exception of
<CODE>&lt;BR&gt;</CODE>, which is ignored.

documentation</A> for more information.

<H2>Mathematics without <CODE>tex2math</CODE></H2>
<p>

If you are not using <CODE>tex2math</CODE>, then you will need to enclose
your mathematics within <CODE>SPAN</CODE> or <CODE>DIV</CODE> tags that
are of <CODE>CLASS="math"</CODE>.  Use a <CODE>SPAN</CODE> for in-line math
and a <CODE>DIV</CODE> for displayed math.  For instance, <SPAN
CLASS="math">P = (x_1,\ldots,x_n)</SPAN> and
<DIV CLASS="math">
  A = \left\lgroup\matrix{a_{11}& \cdots& a_{1m}\cr
                \vdots& \ddots& \vdots\cr
                a_{n1}& \cdots& a_{nm}\cr}\right\rgroup.
</DIV>

<H2>More information</H2>
<p>

See the <A HREF="http://www.math.union.edu/locate/jsMath/examples">jsMath
example files</A> for more examples of using jsMath.  There are several <A
HREF="http://www.math.union.edu/locate/jsMath/examples/extensions.html">extensions</A>
to <SPAN CLASS="math">\rm\TeX</SPAN> that allow jsMath to interact better
with HTML. These provide features such as colored text, tagging mathematics
with CSS styles, and so on.
<p>

More information is available from the <A
HREF="http://www.math.union.edu/locate/jsMath/authors">jsMath author's
documentation</A> site.  JsMath also has a <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmath/">home page at
SourceForge</A>, and that includes <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=172663">public forums</A>
for jsMath where you can ask the jsMath user community for help.
