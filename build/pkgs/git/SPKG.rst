git: Version control system
===========================

Description
-----------

   Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
   unusually rich command set that provides both high-operations and
   full access to internals.

-  ``man git``


Upstream Contact
----------------

-  Maintainer: Junio C. Hamano
-  Website: http://git-scm.com/

Dependencies
------------

-  zlib

Note: excluding libcurl and expat because they are large and only
required if you're communicating with repositories over HTTP. If you
need to do so, please use an external version of git.
