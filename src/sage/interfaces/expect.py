Common Interface Functionality through Pexpect

See the examples in the other sections for how to use specific
interfaces. The interface classes all derive from the generic
interface that is described in this section.

AUTHORS:

- William Stein (2005): initial version

- William Stein (2006-03-01): got rid of infinite loop on startup if
  client system missing

- Felix Lawrence (2009-08-21): edited ._sage_() to support lists and float exponents in foreign notation.

- Simon King (2010-09-25): Expect._local_tmpfile() depends on
  Expect.pid() and is cached; Expect.quit() clears that cache,
  which is important for forking.

- Jean-Pierre Flori (2010,2011): Split non Pexpect stuff into a parent class.

- Simon King (2010-11-23): Ensure that the interface is started again
  after a crash, when a command is executed in _eval_line. Allow
  synchronisation of the GAP interface.

- François Bissey, Bill Page, Jeroen Demeyer (2015-12-09): Upgrade to
  pexpect 4.0.1 + patches, see :trac:`10295`.

# The subprocess is a shared resource.  In a multi-threaded
# environment, there would have to be a lock to control access to the
# subprocess.  Fortunately, Sage does not use Python threads.
# Unfortunately, the combination of the garbage collector and __del__
# methods gives rise to the same issues.  So, in places where we need
# to do a sequence of operations on the subprocess and make sure
# nothing else intervenes (for example, when we write a command and
# then read back the result) we need to disable the garbage collector.
# See TRAC #955 for a more detailed description of this problem.

# To turn off the garbage collector for a particular region of code,
# do:
#   with gc_disabled():
#       ... your code goes here ...
# The garbage collector will be returned to its original state
# whenever the code exits by any means (falling off the end, executing
# "return", "break", or "continue", raising an exception, ...)

In order for Sage (on "local") to launch a "slave" process on "remote", the following command needs to work from local's console, without the need to enter any password:

       "ssh -t remote slave",

where "slave" could be "math" (for text-mode Mathematica), "gap", "magma", "sage", "maple", etc.

This thus requires passwordless authentication to be setup, which can be done with commands like these:
        cd; ssh-keygen -t rsa; scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub remote:.ssh/authorized_keys2\n
(WARNING: this would overwrite your current list of authorized keys on "remote")

In many cases, the server that can actually run "slave" is not accessible from the internet directly, but you have to hop through an intermediate trusted server, say "gate".
If that is your case, get help with _install_hints_ssh_through_gate().

        """
        # Written by Paul-Olivier Dehaye 2007/08/23
        return """

 We assume you would like to run a "slave" process  on a machine called "remote" from a machine running Sage called "local". We also assume "remote" can only be accessed from "local" by ssh'ing first to "gate" (this is a fairly common setup). Sometimes, "gate" and "remote" have a shared filesystem, and this helps a bit.

  Note: You cannot just create shell scripts on "local" and "gate" that would use two successive SSH connections to "remote" in order to simulate running "slave" locally. This is because Sage will sometimes use files (and scp)  to communicate with "remote", which shell scripts would not take care of.

You need to setup:
 * passwordless authentication to "gate" from "local"
 * add passwordless authentication to "remote" from "local",
   for instance by appending the file local:~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to remote:~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 and logging in once
      (this is only needed if "remote" and "gate" don\'t share filesystem)
 * add a few lines to your local:~/.ssh/ssh_config. Mine look like

       Host remote_for_sage
            ProxyCommand ssh gate nc -w 1 remote 22

That's it, normally.

The last step tells ssh that whenever an ssh connection is required to
the host "remote_for_sage", it should tunnel it through "gate". Any
attempt to scp-connect to "remote_for_sage" will use ssh and thus
this configuration file, and properly channel those file transfers
through the tunnel.

A good test is to attempt an scp connection from the command-line
of "local" to "remote_for_sage" as if no tunnel through "gate" was
required. No password should be asked for the second time around.

Finally, we created the new name "remote_for_sage" for "remote",
but this name only exists locally. this is to avoid interfering
with any other program that might already ssh to "remote" in
their own way.

If this all works, you can then make calls like:
         math = Mathematica(server="remote_for_sage")

        Wait for a given expression expr (which could be a regular

        for at most timeout seconds.

        Use ``r._expect.before`` to see what was put in the

        -  ``expr`` - None or a string or list of strings
           (default: None)

        -  ``timeout`` - None or a number (default: None)


        EXAMPLES:

        We test all of this using the Singular interface. First we put
        10 + 15 in the input stream::

            sage: singular._sendstr('def abc = 10 + 15;\n')

        Then we tell singular to print 10, which is an arbitrary number
        different from the expected result 35.

            sage: singular._sendstr('10;\n')

        Here an exception is raised because 25 hasn't appeared yet in the
        output stream. The key thing is that this doesn't lock, but instead
        quickly raises an exception.

        ::

            sage: t = walltime()
            sage: try:
            ....:    singular._expect_expr('25', timeout=float(0.4))
            ....: except Exception:
            ....:    print('Did not get expression')
            Did not get expression

        A quick consistency check on the time that the above took::

            sage: w = walltime(t); 0.3 < w < 10
            True

        We tell Singular to print abc, which equals 25.

        ::

            sage: singular._sendstr('abc;\n')

        Now 25 is in the output stream, so we can wait for it.

        ::

            sage: singular._expect_expr('25')

        This gives us everything before the 25, including the 10 we printed earlier.

        ::

            sage: singular._expect.before.decode('ascii')
            '...10\r\n> '

        We test interrupting ``_expect_expr`` using the GP interface,
        see :trac:`6661`.  Unfortunately, this test doesn't work reliably using
        Singular, see :trac:`9163` and the follow-up :trac:`10476`.
        The ``gp.eval('0')`` in this test makes sure that ``gp`` is
        running, so a timeout of 1 second should be sufficient. ::

        interrupt signals.

        This way, even if you somehow left the interface in a busy state
        computing, calling _synchronize gets everything fixed.
