== Dependencies ==

 * GMP/MPIR (Note: Python is *not* required for ordinary builds.)

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * src/ contains "stable" upstream code, to which we currently apply
   two upstream patches (both to 'configure.in'). These (i.e. the
   files 'patches/configure.in' and 'patches/configure') should be
   removed on the next upgrade to a stable release.
 * GMP-ECM comes with a self-tuning feature; we could support
   that as an option ($SAGE_TUNE_*=yes) in the future.
 * We currently work around a linker bug on MacOS X 10.5 PPC (with
   GCC 4.2.1) which breaks 'configure' if debug symbols are enabled.
   This *might* get fixed in later upstream releases.
 * ECM currently does not (by itself) use the CC and CFLAGS settings
   from 'gmp.h' since we pass (other) options in CFLAGS, and CC is set
   by Sage and might got set by the user (though MPIR currently doesn't
   use its own CFLAGS for the same reason, which is fixed in an MPIR
   2.1.3.p2 spkg). We now at least partially fix that s.t. "optimized"
   code generation options ('-mcpu=...', '-mtune=...') are used by gcc.
   Of course a user can also manually enable them by setting the "global"
   CFLAGS to e.g. '-march=native' on x86[_64] systems, or '-mcpu=...' and
   '-mtune=...' on other architectures where "native" isn't supported.
   Note that this doesn't affect the packages' selection of processor-
   specific optimized [assembly] code.
   'spkg-install' already reads the settings from Sage's and also a
   system-wide GMP / MPIR now, but doesn't (yet) use all of them.
   If SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes", we should avoid too specific settings of
   "-mcpu=...", and perhaps pass a more generic "--host=..." to
   'configure'. (MPIR honors '--enable-fat' to some extent, but this
   option isn't used on anything other than x86 / x86_64.)

== Changelog ==

=== ecm-6.3.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, November 25th, 2010) ===
 * #5847: Apply another patch from upstream to 'configure.in' to fix com-
   pilation on 32-bit x86 processors supporting SSE2. (Also #10252.)
   (There's only a single, cumulative patch file since both patches are to
   'configure.in'.)
 * Work around linker bug on MacOS X 10.5 PPC (see Special Update/Build
   Instructions above, and #5847 comment 35 ff.).
 * Allow passing extra arguments to 'configure' through ECM_EXTRA_OPTS.
 * Add "-march=native" to CFLAGS on platforms that support it, or use
   processor-specific CFLAGS from GMP's / MPIR's 'gmp.h' if available,
   but only if CFLAGS do not already contain similar (i.e., don't over-
   ride a user's choice). [Subject to further improvement.]
 * Print settings of CC, CFLAGS etc. and how we configure.
 * Print settings of CC and CFLAGS found in 'SAGE_LOCAL/include/gmp.h'
   and eventually a system-wide 'gmp.h', although the latter aren't (yet)
   used at all, and only processor-specific parts of the former.
 * Add '-fPIC' conditionally, i.e. not if we're also building a shared
   library (or '--with-pic' was given).
 * Don't delete previous installations unless the build succeeded.
 * Further clean-up.

=== ecm-6.3.p1 (Jeroen Demeyer, November 10th, 2010) ===
 * #5847: Apply a patch from upstream to configure.in to fix compilation
   on 32-bit PowerPC processors.

=== ecm-6.3.p0 (Leif Leonhardy, November 4th, 2010) ===
 * #5847: Reviewer patch applied to Mike's spkg (upgrade to 6.3)
 * There are no patches, but to avoid confusion with the previous
   one, it's now 'p0'.
 * Added sanity checks to spkg-install and spkg-check.
 * Add debug symbols by default, disable optimization if SAGE_DEBUG=yes,
   enable optimization (-O3) otherwise.
 * Remove also the manual page of previous installations.
 * Typo: 'rm -r' -> 'rm -f' (header file)
 * Removed setting of CXXFLAGS, since we don't have C++ code.
 * Don't overwrite CFLAGS if SAGE64=yes (instead, append).
   Removed -O2 -g in that case. Make use of CFLAG64 if set.
 * Quote $SAGE_LOCAL in the parameters to configure, too.
 * Use $MAKE instead of 'make' in spkg-check, too.
 * Some messages changed (e.g. all failures now starting with "Error"),
   some added.
 * A few comments/notes added (SPKG.txt, spkg-install).

=== ecm-6.3 (Mike Hansen, August 16th, 2010) ===
 * #5847: Update GMP-ECM to 6.3

=== ecm-6.2.1.p1 (Jaap Spies, Jan 25th, 2010) ===
 * Made SAGE64="yes" work also for Open Solaris 64 bit
 * Removed Michael Mabshoff as maintainer

=== ecm-6.2.1.p1 (François Bissey, October 26th, 2009) ===
 * The removal of the old version of ecm in ecm-6.2.1_p0.spkg is
   broken because of the typo "SAGE_LCOAL"; notice that it should be
   "SAGE_LOCAL".

=== ecm-6.2.1.p0 (Michael Abshoff, January 19th, 2008) ===
 * bump version to force recompile due to gmp -> MPIR switch

=== ecm-6.2.1 (Michael Abshoff, December 23rd, 2008) ===
 * upgrade to latest upstream release (#3237)
 * clean up old static library, headers and binary
 * improve SPKG.txt

=== ecm-6.1.3.p0 (Michael Abshoff, May 18th, 2008) ===
 * add 64 bit OSX support

=== ecm-6.1.3 (Michael Abshoff, Sept. 24th, 2007) ===
 * update to ecm 6.1.3

* Initial version - date unknown:

I obtained the package from http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/ecm/
