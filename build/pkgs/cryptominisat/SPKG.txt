== Description ==

  CryptoMiniSat is a SAT solver that aims to become a premiere SAT
  solver with all the features and speed of successful SAT solvers,
  such as MiniSat and PrecoSat. The long-term goals of CryptoMiniSat
  are to be an efficient sequential, parallel and distributed
  solver. There are solvers that are good at one or the other,
  e.g. ManySat (parallel) or PSolver (distributed), but we wish to
  excel at all.

  CryptoMiniSat 2.5 won the SAT Race 2010 among 20 solvers submitted
  by researchers and industry.
