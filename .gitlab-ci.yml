# This file configures automatic builds of Sage on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
# To make the build time not too excessive, we seed the build cache with
# sagemath/sagemath-dev:develop. When basic SPKGs changed, this does not help
# much and the full build might exceed the set time limit in GitLab.  You can
# increase that limit in Settings → CI/CD.
# You can also provision your own private more powerful runner in the same
# place
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker-executor;
# or set up your favourite cloud service to provide an on-demand autoscale
# runner. More details below.

# As of early 2018 a run on GitLab CI takes about 45 minutes. We could probably
# save 10 minutes by not building/pushing/testing dev images for branches other
# than master/develop.

# Note that most of the time during CI is spent with pulling and pushing of
# docker images and copying files locally as part of the docker build.  At the
# moment there is no reliable way of passing the docker images to the following
# stages without explicit pushing/pulling or similar:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/1107

# The timings mentioned above are typical values. The shared runners provided
# on gitlab.com are sometimes much slower depending on the runner you are
# scheduled on. Sometimes it's slower for no apparent reason, probably just an
# overcommittment of virtual machines on hardware.

# GitLab provides several flavours of shared runners (as of early 2018):
# * runners tagged as "do" (digitalocean.com) provide about 60GB of HDD, two
#   cores, but only 2GB of RAM. The RAM is sometimes not sufficient to build
#   the documentation.
# * runners tagged as "gce" (Google Compute Engine) provide about 22GB of HDD,
#   a single core, 4GB of RAM. Since we are relying on OverlayFS, the disk
#   space is not sufficient to build sage from scratch.
# The shared runners are terminated after three hours. Currently, this is often
# insufficient to build sage from scratch.

# If you want to provide your own runners, make sure to tag them as follows:
# * "big" (60GB of disk space are available) to make build-from-clean pass.

# We use docker-in-docker to build our docker images, i.e., we run a
# docker:dind "service" container and link to it from the container running the
# actual scripts below.
# Our scripts automatically connect to this service (unless you override it by
# setting DOCKER_HOST.) For example, each RUN statement in the Dockerfile
# spawns a docker container inside the docker:dind container to perform the RUN
# command there.
# It can be faster to expose your outer docker daemon by mounting
# /var/run/docker.sock to /var/run/docker.sock and setting DOCKER_HOST in
# Settings -> CI/CD -> Secret variable to unix:///var/run/docker.sock. (The
# speedup is mostly due to sharing layers of intermediate images.) However,
# this is only possible if you provision your own runners. Shared gitlab
# runners, do not bind mount /var/run/docker.sock. Also, docker:dind provides
# better isolation. If you expect many builds to run simultaneously on a host,
# conflicting tags can cause issues with a mounted DOCKER_HOST.
