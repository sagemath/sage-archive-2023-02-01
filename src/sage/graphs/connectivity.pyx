Connectivity related functions

This module implements the connectivity based functions for graphs and digraphs.
The methods in this module are also available as part of GenericGraph, DiGraph
or Graph classes as aliases, and these methods can be accessed through this
module or as class methods.
Here is what the module can do:

**For both directed and undirected graphs:**

.. csv-table::
    :class: contentstable
    :widths: 30, 70
    :delim: |

    :meth:`is_connected` | Check whether the (di)graph is connected.
    :meth:`connected_components` | Return the list of connected components
    :meth:`connected_components_number` | Return the number of connected components.
    :meth:`connected_components_subgraphs` | Return a list of connected components as graph objects.
    :meth:`connected_component_containing_vertex` | Return a list of the vertices connected to vertex.

    :meth:`edge_connectivity` | Return the edge connectivity of the graph.
    :meth:`vertex_connectivity` | Return the vertex connectivity of the graph.

**For DiGraph:**

.. csv-table::
    :class: contentstable
    :widths: 30, 70
    :delim: |

    :meth:`is_strongly_connected` | Check whether the current ``DiGraph`` is strongly connected.
    :meth:`strongly_connected_components_digraph` | Return the digraph of the strongly connected components
    :meth:`strongly_connected_components_subgraphs` | Return the strongly connected components as a list of subgraphs.
    :meth:`strongly_connected_component_containing_vertex` | Return the strongly connected component containing a given vertex.
    :meth:`strong_articulation_points` | Return the strong articulation points of this digraph.

**For undirected graphs:**

.. csv-table::
    :class: contentstable
    :widths: 30, 70
    :delim: |

    :meth:`bridges` | Returns an iterator over the bridges (or cut edges) of given undirected graph.
    :meth:`cleave` | Return the connected subgraphs separated by the input vertex cut.

    Return the blocks and cut vertices of the graph.

    In the case of a digraph, this computation is done on the underlying
    graph.

    A cut vertex is one whose deletion increases the number of connected
    components. A block is a maximal induced subgraph which itself has no
    cut vertices. Two distinct blocks cannot overlap in more than a single
    cut vertex.

    INPUT:

    - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"Tarjan_Boost"``); the algorithm to
      use among:

      - ``"Tarjan_Boost"`` (default) -- Tarjan's algorithm (Boost
        implementation)

      - ``"Tarjan_Sage"`` -- Tarjan's algorithm (Sage implementation)

    - ``sort`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to sort vertices inside
      the components and the list of cut vertices
      **currently only available for ``"Tarjan_Sage"``**

    OUTPUT: ``(B, C)``, where ``B`` is a list of blocks - each is a list of
    vertices and the blocks are the corresponding induced subgraphs - and
    ``C`` is a list of cut vertices.

    ALGORITHM:

      We implement the algorithm proposed by Tarjan in [Tarjan72]_. The
      original version is recursive. We emulate the recursion using a stack.

    A disconnected graph::

    Return the blocks-and-cuts tree of ``self``.

    This new graph has two different kinds of vertices, some representing the
    blocks (type B) and some other the cut vertices of the graph (type C).

    There is an edge between a vertex `u` of type B and a vertex `v` of type C
    if the cut-vertex corresponding to `v` is in the block corresponding to `u`.

    The resulting graph is a tree, with the additional characteristic property
    that the distance between two leaves is even. When ``self`` is not
    connected, the resulting graph is a forest.

    When ``self`` is biconnected, the tree is reduced to a single node of
    type `B`.

    Return the edge connectivity of the graph.

    For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Connectivity_(graph_theory)`.

    .. NOTE::

        When the graph is a directed graph, this method actually computes the
        *strong* connectivity, (i.e. a directed graph is strongly `k`-connected
        if there are `k` disjoint paths between any two vertices `u, v`). If you
        do not want to consider strong connectivity, the best is probably to
        convert your ``DiGraph`` object to a ``Graph`` object, and compute the
        connectivity of this other graph.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- the input Sage (Di)Graph

    - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``)

      - When set to ``True`` (default), only the value is returned.

      - When set to ``False``, both the value and a minimum vertex cut are
        returned.

    - ``implementation`` -- string (default: ``None``); selects an
      implementation:

      - ``None`` (default) -- selects the best implementation available

      - ``"boost"`` -- use the Boost graph library (which is much more
        efficient). It is not available when ``edge_labels=True``, and it is
        unreliable for directed graphs (see :trac:`18753`).

      -``"Sage"`` -- use Sage's implementation based on integer linear
       programming

    - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

      - When set to ``True``, computes a weighted minimum cut where each edge
        has a weight defined by its label. (If an edge has no label, `1` is
        assumed.). Implies ``boost`` = ``False``.

      - When set to ``False``, each edge has weight `1`.

    - ``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

      - When set to ``True``, also returns the two sets of vertices that are
        disconnected by the cut. Implies ``value_only=False``.

    - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer Linear
      Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one
      is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which default solver is
      used, see the method :meth:`solve
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of verbosity. Set
      to 0 by default, which means quiet.

    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP solvers
      over an inexact base ring; see
      :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

    EXAMPLES:

    A basic application on the PappusGraph::

        sage: from sage.graphs.connectivity import edge_connectivity
        sage: g = graphs.PappusGraph()
        sage: edge_connectivity(g)
        3
        sage: g.edge_connectivity()
        3

    The edge connectivity of a complete graph is its minimum degree, and one of
    the two parts of the bipartition is reduced to only one vertex. The graph of
    the cut edges is isomorphic to a Star graph::

        sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
        sage: [ value, edges, [ setA, setB ]] = edge_connectivity(g,vertices=True)
        sage: value
        4
        sage: len(setA) == 1 or len(setB) == 1
        True
        sage: cut = Graph()
        sage: cut.add_edges(edges)
        sage: cut.is_isomorphic(graphs.StarGraph(4))
        True

    Even if obviously in any graph we know that the edge connectivity is less
    than the minimum degree of the graph::

        sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(10,.3)
        sage: min(g.degree()) >= edge_connectivity(g)
        True

    If we build a tree then assign to its edges a random value, the minimum cut
    will be the edge with minimum value::

        sage: tree = graphs.RandomTree(10)
        sage: for u,v in tree.edge_iterator(labels=None):
        ....:      tree.set_edge_label(u, v, random())
        sage: minimum = min(tree.edge_labels())
        sage: [_, [(_, _, l)]] = edge_connectivity(tree, value_only=False, use_edge_labels=True)
        sage: l == minimum
        True

    When ``value_only=True`` and ``implementation="sage"``, this function is
    optimized for small connectivity values and does not need to build a linear
    program.

    It is the case for graphs which are not connected ::

        sage: g = 2 * graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: edge_connectivity(g, implementation="sage")
        0.0

    For directed graphs, the strong connectivity is tested through the dedicated
    function::

        sage: g = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(3)
        sage: edge_connectivity(g, implementation="sage")
        0.0

    We check that the result with Boost is the same as the result without Boost::

        sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(15, .3)
        sage: edge_connectivity(g, implementation="boost") == edge_connectivity(g, implementation="sage")
        True

    Boost interface also works with directed graphs::

        sage: edge_connectivity(digraphs.Circuit(10), implementation="boost", vertices=True)
        [1, [(0, 1)], [{0}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}]]

    However, the Boost algorithm is not reliable if the input is directed
    (see :trac:`18753`)::

        sage: g = digraphs.Path(3)
        sage: edge_connectivity(g)
        0.0
        sage: edge_connectivity(g, implementation="boost")
        1
        sage: g.add_edge(1, 0)
        sage: edge_connectivity(g)
        0.0
        sage: edge_connectivity(g, implementation="boost")
        0

    TESTS:

    Checking that the two implementations agree::

        sage: for i in range(10):
        ....:     g = graphs.RandomGNP(30, 0.3)
        ....:     e1 = edge_connectivity(g, implementation="boost")
        ....:     e2 = edge_connectivity(g, implementation="sage")

    Return the vertex connectivity of the graph.

    For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Connectivity_(graph_theory)` and
    the :wikipedia:`K-vertex-connected_graph`.

    .. NOTE::

        * When the graph is directed, this method actually computes the *strong*
          connectivity, (i.e. a directed graph is strongly `k`-connected if
          there are `k` vertex disjoint paths between any two vertices `u,
          v`). If you do not want to consider strong connectivity, the best is
          probably to convert your ``DiGraph`` object to a ``Graph`` object, and
          compute the connectivity of this other graph.

        * By convention, a complete graph on `n` vertices is `n-1` connected. In
          this case, no certificate can be given as there is no pair of vertices
          split by a cut of order `k-1`. For this reason, the certificates
          returned in this situation are empty.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- the input Sage (Di)Graph

    - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``)

      - When set to ``True`` (default), only the value is returned.

      - When set to ``False``, both the value and a minimum vertex cut are
        returned.

    - ``sets`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to also return the two
        sets of vertices that are disconnected by the cut (implies
        ``value_only=False``)

    - ``k`` -- integer (default: ``None``); when specified, check if the vertex
      connectivity of the (di)graph is larger or equal to `k`. The method thus
      outputs a boolean only.

    - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer Linear
      Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one
      is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which default solver is
      used, see the method :meth:`solve
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of verbosity. Set
      to 0 by default, which means quiet.

    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP solvers
      over an inexact base ring; see
      :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

    EXAMPLES:

    A basic application on a ``PappusGraph``::

       sage: from sage.graphs.connectivity import vertex_connectivity
       sage: g=graphs.PappusGraph()
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g)
       3
       sage: g.vertex_connectivity()
       3

    In a grid, the vertex connectivity is equal to the minimum degree, in which
    case one of the two sets is of cardinality `1`::

       sage: g = graphs.GridGraph([ 3,3 ])
       sage: [value, cut, [ setA, setB ]] = vertex_connectivity(g, sets=True)
       sage: len(setA) == 1 or len(setB) == 1
       True

    A vertex cut in a tree is any internal vertex::

       sage: tree = graphs.RandomTree(15)
       sage: val, [cut_vertex] = vertex_connectivity(tree, value_only=False)
       sage: tree.degree(cut_vertex) > 1
       True

    When ``value_only = True``, this function is optimized for small
    connectivity values and does not need to build a linear program.

    It is the case for connected graphs which are not connected::

       sage: g = 2 * graphs.PetersenGraph()
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g)
       0

    Or if they are just 1-connected::

       sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(10)
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g)
       1

    For directed graphs, the strong connectivity is tested through the dedicated
    function::

       sage: g = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(3)
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g)
       0

    A complete graph on `10` vertices is `9`-connected::

       sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(10)
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g)
       9

    A complete digraph on `10` vertices is `9`-connected::

       sage: g = DiGraph(graphs.CompleteGraph(10))
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g)
       9

    When parameter ``k`` is set, we only check for the existence of a vertex cut
    of order at least ``k``::

       sage: g = graphs.PappusGraph()
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g, k=3)
       True
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g, k=4)
       False

    TESTS:

    Giving negative value to parameter ``k``::

       sage: g = graphs.PappusGraph()
       sage: vertex_connectivity(g, k=-1)
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       ValueError: parameter k must be strictly positive

    The empty graph has vertex connectivity 0, is considered connected but not
    biconnected. The empty digraph is considered strongly connected::

       sage: from sage.graphs.connectivity import is_strongly_connected
       sage: from sage.graphs.connectivity import is_connected
       sage: empty = Graph()
       sage: vertex_connectivity(empty)
       0
       sage: vertex_connectivity(empty, k=1) == is_connected(empty)
       True
       sage: vertex_connectivity(Graph(), k=2) == empty.is_biconnected()
       True
       sage: vertex_connectivity(DiGraph(), k=1) == is_strongly_connected(DiGraph())
       True

    If ``G`` is not a Sage (Di)Graph, an error is raised::

        sage: vertex_connectivity('I am not a graph')

    Return the digraph of the strongly connected components

    The digraph of the strongly connected components of a graph `G` has a vertex
    per strongly connected component included in `G`. There is an edge from a
    component `C_1` to a component `C_2` if there is an edge in `G` from a
    vertex `u_1 \in C_1` to a vertex `u_2 \in C_2`.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- the input DiGraph

    - ``keep_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); when
      ``keep_labels=True``, the resulting digraph has an edge from a component
      `C_i` to a component `C_j` for each edge in `G` from a vertex `u_i \in
      C_i` to a vertex `u_j \in C_j`. Hence the resulting digraph may have loops
      and multiple edges. However, edges in the result with same source, target,
      and label are not duplicated (see examples below). When
      ``keep_labels=False``, the return digraph is simple, so without loops nor
      multiple edges, and edges are unlabelled.

    EXAMPLES:

    Such a digraph is always acyclic::

def strong_articulation_points(G):
    r"""
    Return the strong articulation points of this digraph.

    A vertex is a strong articulation point if its deletion increases the
    number of strongly connected components. This method implements the
    algorithm described in [ILS2012]_. The time complexity is dominated by
    the time complexity of the immediate dominators finding algorithm.

    OUTPUT: The list of strong articulation points.

def cleave(G, cut_vertices=None, virtual_edges=True, solver=None, verbose=0,
           *, integrality_tolerance=1e-3):
    r"""
    Return the connected subgraphs separated by the input vertex cut.

    Given a connected (multi)graph `G` and a vertex cut `X`, this method
    computes the list of subgraphs of `G` induced by each connected component
    `c` of `G\setminus X` plus `X`, i.e., `G[c\cup X]`.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a Graph.

    - ``cut_vertices`` -- iterable container of vertices (default: ``None``); a
      set of vertices representing a vertex cut of ``G``. If no vertex cut is
      given, the method will compute one via a call to
      :meth:`~sage.graphs.connectivity.vertex_connectivity`.

    - ``virtual_edges`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to add virtual
      edges to the sides of the cut or not. A virtual edge is an edge between a
      pair of vertices of the cut that are not connected by an edge in ``G``.

    - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer Linear
      Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one
      is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which default solver is
      used, see the method :meth:`solve
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of verbosity. Set
      to 0 by default, which means quiet.

    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP solvers
      over an inexact base ring; see
      :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

    OUTPUT: A triple `(S, C, f)`, where

    - `S` is a list of the graphs that are sides of the vertex cut.

    - `C` is the graph of the cocycles. For each pair of vertices of the cut,
      if there exists an edge between them, `C` has one copy of each edge
      connecting them in ``G`` per sides of the cut plus one extra copy.
      Furthermore, when ``virtual_edges == True``, if a pair of vertices of the
      cut is not connected by an edge in ``G``, then it has one virtual edge
      between them per sides of the cut.

    - `f` is the complement of the subgraph of ``G`` induced by the vertex
      cut. Hence, its vertex set is the vertex cut, and its edge set is the set
      of virtual edges (i.e., edges between pairs of vertices of the cut that
      are not connected by an edge in ``G``). When ``virtual_edges == False``,
      the edge set is empty.

    r"""
    Return an SPQR-tree representing the triconnected components of the graph.

    An SPQR-tree is a tree data structure used to represent the triconnected
    components of a biconnected (multi)graph and the 2-vertex cuts separating
    them. A node of a SPQR-tree, and the graph associated with it, can be one of
    the following four types:

    - ``"S"`` -- the associated graph is a cycle with at least three vertices.
      ``"S"`` stands for ``series``.

    - ``"P"`` -- the associated graph is a dipole graph, a multigraph with two
      vertices and three or more edges. ``"P"`` stands for ``parallel``.

    - ``"Q"`` -- the associated graph has a single real edge. This trivial case
      is necessary to handle the graph that has only one edge.

    - ``"R"`` -- the associated graph is a 3-connected graph that is not a cycle
      or dipole. ``"R"`` stands for ``rigid``.

    This method decomposes a biconnected graph into cycles, cocycles, and
    3-connected blocks summed over cocycles, and arranges them as a SPQR-tree.
    More precisely, it splits the graph at each of its 2-vertex cuts, giving a
    unique decomposition into 3-connected blocks, cycles and cocycles. The
    cocycles are dipole graphs with one edge per real edge between the included
    vertices and one additional (virtual) edge per connected component resulting
    from deletion of the vertices in the cut. See the :wikipedia:`SPQR_tree`.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- the input graph

    - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"Hopcroft_Tarjan"``); the algorithm to
      use among:

      - ``"Hopcroft_Tarjan"`` (default) -- use the algorithm proposed by
        Hopcroft and Tarjan in [Hopcroft1973]_ and later corrected by Gutwenger
        and Mutzel in [Gut2001]_. See
        :class:`~sage.graphs.connectivity.TriconnectivitySPQR`.

      - ``"cleave"`` -- using method :meth:`~sage.graphs.connectivity.cleave`

    - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer Linear
      Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one
      is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which default solver is
      used, see the method :meth:`solve
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of verbosity. Set
      to 0 by default, which means quiet.

    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP solvers
      over an inexact base ring; see
      :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

    OUTPUT: ``SPQR-tree`` a tree whose vertices are labeled with the block's type
    and the subgraph of three-blocks in the decomposition.

cdef class TriconnectivitySPQR:
    r"""
    Decompose a graph into triconnected components and build SPQR-tree.

    This class implements the algorithm proposed by Hopcroft and Tarjan in
    [Hopcroft1973]_, and later corrected by Gutwenger and Mutzel in [Gut2001]_,
    for finding the triconnected components of a biconnected graph. It then
    organizes these components into a SPQR-tree. See the:wikipedia:`SPQR_tree`.

    A SPQR-tree is a tree data structure used to represent the triconnected
    components of a biconnected (multi)graph and the 2-vertex cuts separating
    them. A node of a SPQR-tree, and the graph associated with it, can be one of
    the following four types:

    - ``"S"`` -- the associated graph is a cycle with at least three vertices.
      ``"S"`` stands for ``series`` and is also called a ``polygon``.

    - ``"P"`` -- the associated graph is a dipole graph, a multigraph with two
      vertices and three or more edges. ``"P"`` stands for ``parallel`` and the
      node is called a ``bond``.

    - ``"Q"`` -- the associated graph has a single real edge. This trivial case
      is necessary to handle the graph that has only one edge.

    - ``"R"`` -- the associated graph is a 3-vertex-connected graph that is not
      a cycle or dipole. ``"R"`` stands for ``rigid``.

    The edges of the tree indicate the 2-vertex cuts of the graph.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- graph; if ``G`` is a :class:`DiGraph`, the computation is done on
      the underlying :class:`Graph` (i.e., ignoring edge orientation)

    - ``check`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); indicates whether ``G`` needs to
      be tested for biconnectivity

    def get_spqr_tree(self):
        r"""
        Return an SPQR-tree representing the triconnected components of the
        graph.

        An SPQR-tree is a tree data structure used to represent the triconnected
        components of a biconnected (multi)graph and the 2-vertex cuts
        separating them. A node of a SPQR-tree, and the graph associated with
        it, can be one of the following four types:

        - ``"S"`` -- the associated graph is a cycle with at least three vertices.
          ``"S"`` stands for ``series``.

        - ``"P"`` -- the associated graph is a dipole graph, a multigraph with
          two vertices and three or more edges. ``"P"`` stands for ``parallel``.

        - ``"Q"`` -- the associated graph has a single real edge. This trivial
          case is necessary to handle the graph that has only one edge.

        - ``"R"`` -- the associated graph is a 3-connected graph that is not a
          cycle or dipole. ``"R"`` stands for ``rigid``.

        The edges of the tree indicate the 2-vertex cuts of the graph.

        OUTPUT:

        ``SPQR-tree`` a tree whose vertices are labeled with the block's
        type and the subgraph of three-blocks in the decomposition.

    Check whether the graph is triconnected.

    A triconnected graph is a connected graph on 3 or more vertices that is not
    broken into disconnected pieces by deleting any pair of vertices.

    EXAMPLES:

    The Petersen graph is triconnected::

        sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: G.is_triconnected()
        True

    But a 2D grid is not::

        sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(3, 3)
        sage: G.is_triconnected()

    By convention, a cycle of order 3 is triconnected::

        sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(3)
        sage: G.is_triconnected()
        True

    But cycles of order 4 and more are not::

        sage: [graphs.CycleGraph(i).is_triconnected() for i in range(4, 8)]
        [False, False, False, False]

    Comparing different methods on random graphs that are not always
    triconnected::
