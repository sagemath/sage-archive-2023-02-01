Partial cubes

The code in this module that recognizes partial cubes is originally
from the PADS library by David Eppstein, which is available at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/ under the MIT license. It has a
quadratic runtime and has been described in [Eppstein2008]_.

For more information on partial cubes, see the
:wikipedia:`Partial cube`.

Recognition algorithm
---------------------

Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^

A **partial cube** is an isometric subgraph `G` of a
:meth:`~sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.CubeGraph` (of
possibly high dimension). Consequently, the vertices of `G` can be
labelled with binary sequences in such a way that the distance between
two vertices `u,v\in G` is the Hamming distance between their labels.

**Tokens** and their **action**: in the terminology of
[Eppstein2008]_, a token represents a transition of the form:

    *switch the k-th bit of the binary string from 0 to 1*

Each token can be matched with a 'reversed' token that performs the
same switch in the opposite direction. Alternatively, a token can be
seen as a set of disjoint (directed) edges of `G`, corresponding to
the transitions. When a vertex `v\in G` is the source of such an edge,
it is said that the token *acts* on `v`.

Observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Shortest paths**: in a hypercube, a shortest path between two
vertices uses each token at most once. Furthermore, it cannot use both
a token and it reverse.

**Cycles**: a cycle in a partial cube is necessarily even, as
hypercubes are bipartite. If an edge `e` of a cycle `C` belongs to a
token `T`, then the edge opposite to `e` in `C` belongs to the reverse
of `T`.

**Incident edges**: all `2d_G(v)` arcs incident to a given vertex
belong to as many different tokens.

Algorithm
^^^^^^^^^

**Labeling**: Iteratively, the algorithm selects a vertex `v\in G`,
which is naturally associated to `2d(v)` tokens. It then performs a
breadth-first search from `v`, applying the previous observation on
cycles to attribute a token to some of the edges it meets. None of the
edges whose token remains undecided after this step can belong to one
of those `2d(v)` tokens, by virtue of the observation on shortest
paths.

The labeled edges can then be simplified (contracted) if the previous
step did not lead to a contradiction, and the procedure is applied
again until the graph is contracted to a single vertex and all edges
are labeled.

A partial cube is correctly labeled at this step, but some other
graphs can also satisfy the procedure.

**Checking the labeling**: once all tokens are defined and the
vertices are labeled with a binary string, we check that they define
an isometric subgraph of the hypercube. To ensure that the distance
`d(v_0,u)` is what we expect for any vertex `u`, it is sufficient to
find, for any vertex `u`, a neighbor `n_u` of `u` whose Hamming
distance with `v_0` is strictly less than the Hamming distance between
`u` and `v_0`. Here is the algorithm used to check the labeling:

* For an initial vertex `v`, run a BFS starting from `v`, and
  associate to every other vertex `u` a token that brings `u` closer
  to `v`. This yields shortest paths from every vertex to `v`.

* Assuming that the information is computed (and correct) for `v`, it
  is easy to update it for a neighbor `v'` of `v`. Indeed, if we write
  `T` the token that turns `v` into `v'`, only the vertices which were
  associated with the reverse of `T` need to select a new neighbour. All
  others can remain as they were previously.

  With this second observation, one can efficiently check that the
  distance between all pairs of vertices are what they should be. In
  the implementation, the sequence of the sources `(v, v', ...)` is
  given by a depth-first search.

def is_partial_cube(G, certificate=False):
    r"""
    Test whether the given graph is a partial cube.

    A partial cube is a graph that can be isometrically embedded into a
    hypercube, i.e., its vertices can be labelled with (0,1)-vectors of some
    fixed length such that the distance between any two vertices in the graph
    equals the Hamming distance of their labels.

    Originally written by D. Eppstein for the PADS library
    (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/), see also
    [Eppstein2008]_.  The algorithm runs in `O(n^2)` time, where `n`
    is the number of vertices. See the documentation of
    :mod:`~sage.graphs.partial_cube` for an overview of the algorithm.

    INPUT:

    - ``certificate`` (boolean; ``False``) -- The function returns ``True``
      or ``False`` according to the graph, when ``certificate = False``. When
      ``certificate = True`` and the graph is a partial cube, the function
      returns ``(True, mapping)``, where ``mapping`` is an isometric mapping of
      the vertices of the graph to the vertices of a hypercube ((0, 1)-strings
      of a fixed length). When ``certificate = True`` and the graph is not a
      partial cube, ``(False, None)`` is returned.

    EXAMPLES:

    The Petersen graph is not a partial cube::

        sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: g.is_partial_cube()
        False

    All prisms are partial cubes::

        sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(10).cartesian_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(2))
        sage: g.is_partial_cube()
        True

    TESTS:

    The returned mapping is an isometric embedding into a hypercube::

        sage: g = graphs.DesarguesGraph()
        sage: _, m = g.is_partial_cube(certificate = True)
        sage: m # random
        {0: '00000',
