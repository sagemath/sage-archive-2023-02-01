Algebraic Function Fields
=========================

Sage allows basic computations with elements and ideals in orders of
algebraic function fields over arbitrary constant fields. Advanced
computations, like computing the genus or a basis of the Riemann-Roch space of
a divisor, are available for global function fields.
