 * Maintainer: Ivan Andrus <darthandrus [at] gmail.com>
 * Bitbucket mercurial repository: [[http://bitbucket.org/gvol/sage-mode]]

== Dependencies ==

 * sage
 * GNU Emacs (with python.el, not python-mode.el)


== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

;; Start .emacs


;; After installation of the spkg, you must add something like the
;; following to your .emacs:

(add-to-list 'load-path "$INSTALL_DIR")
(require 'sage "sage")
(setq sage-command "$SAGE_ROOT/sage")

;; If you want sage-view to typeset all your output and display plot()
;; commands inline, uncomment the following line and configure sage-view:
;; (add-hook 'sage-startup-after-prompt-hook 'sage-view)
;; In particular customize the variable sage-view-default-commands.
;; Using sage-view to typeset output requires a working LaTeX
;; installation with the preview package.

;; Also consider running (customize-group 'sage) to see more options.

;; End .emacs


== Changelog ==

=== sage-mode-0.9.1 (Ivan Andrus, 2013-03-10) ===
* Fixed some build issues

=== sage-mode-0.9 (Ivan Andrus, 2013-03-10) ===
* Fixed completion with new ipython
* Fixed interaction with new python.el
* Fixed recognition of sage-view output
* Added sage-attach-this-file
* Make sage-view prettier

=== sage-mode-0.8 (Ivan Andrus, 2012-09-12) ===
* Many improvements and new maintainer.

=== sage-mode-0.7 (Nick Alexander, 2011-10-07) ===
* Fix a bug reported by Ivan Andrus regarding font-lock and
triple-quoted strings.

* sage-mode is now hosted on bitbucket for easy viewing and cloning:
browse to [[http://bitbucket.org/gvol/sage-mode]].

=== sage-mode-0.6 (Nick Alexander, 2009-05-11) ===
* `sage-run' no longer waits for a sage: prompt by default.  This can cause
problems if `sage-startup-after-prompt-hook' is non-trivial, but doesn't lock
up emacs busy waiting for the prompt.

* `sage-send-doctest' now works with multiline tests and one line function
definitions.

* `sage-rerun' now exits from the debugger if it sees the debugger prompt, and
`sage-build' with a prefix argument (build and run sage) should no longer hang.

* `pyrex-mode' is now autoload-ed and the default for pyx, pxi, and pxd files.

* `next-error' now jumps between top-level errors, avoiding lower level source
files.  Lower level source files are still hyperlinked.

* `sage-test' with a prefix argument now offers to test without rebuilding.

* Now `sage-send-doctest' and `sage-send-region' are bound in *Help* buffer.

* `sage-send-{buffer, region doctest}' now either automatically
(`sage-quit-debugger-automatically') or after a prompt quit the debugger
before sending input to the sage slave.

* In the debugger, very short history items are not remembered.  (No more
looping through u/d in the history.)

* *sage-test* buffers now search for test status rather than relying on the
exit codes that incorrectly say tests failed all the time.

* SPKG.txt and spkg-install now print paths in the install instructions.

* C-u RET no longer sends input to the sage slave with output to
*sage-output*.  Use `sage-move-output-to-buffer' instead, or
`comint-write-output' to save to a file.

=== sage-mode-0.5.4 (Nick Alexander, 2009-03-13) ===
* Fixed errors in `sage-build' and `sage-test' autoloads; made sage-mode.el
provide 'sage-mode.

=== sage-mode-0.5.3 (Nick Alexander, 2009-03-12) ===
* Updated `sage-view' to new version.

* Completely reworked keymaps and added preliminary menus.

* Completely reworked customize interface and added autoload interface
through `sage.el' and autogenerated `sage-load.el'.

* Added some documentation and additional customization options.

=== sage-mode-0.5.2 (Nick Alexander, 2009-02-19) ===
* Made individual parts of `sage-view' toggleable, fixed bugs with plots and
multiple outputs.

=== sage-mode-0.5.1 (Nick Alexander, 2009-02-11) ===
* Added `sage-startup-hook' and made `sage-view' actually usable.

=== sage-mode-0.5 (Nick Alexander, 2009-01-31) ===
* Incorporated Matthias Meulien's sage-view.el.  To enable, try sage-view or
  (add-hook 'inferior-sage-mode-hook 'sage-view).

* Added sage-rerun to restart sage and made C-u C-c C-b (sage-build with a
  prefix argument) build and restart sage.

=== sage-mode-0.4 (Nick Alexander, 2008-06-16) ===
I honestly can't remember.

=== sage-mode-0.3 (Nick Alexander, 2008-06-15) ===
Add sage-build command. Make sage-default-test-* more robust, and add
`sage-send-all-doctest-lines-in-file'.

* sage-build.el: new module for building (sage-build) and running
(sage-build with prefix argument) sage.

* sage-test.el (sage-send-all-doctest-lines): new function. Runs all
sage: doctest lines in a file in sequence. Use with pdb to reproduce
errors found only after sage -t.

* sage-test.el (sage-default-test-command,
sage-default-test-new-command): cleaned up to use sage-build.

=== sage-mode-0.2 (Nick Alexander, 2008-06-14) ===
First alpha version, for Mike Hansen to use and test.

=== sage-mode-0.1 (Nick Alexander) ===
First internal version.
