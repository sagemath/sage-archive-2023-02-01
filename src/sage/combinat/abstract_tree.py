Abstract Recursive Trees

The purpose of this class is to help implement trees with a specific structure
on the children of each node. For instance, one could want to define a tree in
which each node sees its children as linearly (see the :mod:`Ordered Trees
<sage.combinat.ordered_tree>` module) or cyclically ordered.

**Tree structures**

Conceptually, one can define a tree structure from any object that can contain
others. Indeed, a list can contain lists which contain lists which contain
lists, and thus define a tree ... The same can be done with sets, or any kind
of iterable objects.

While any iterable is sufficient to encode trees, it can prove useful to have
other methods available like isomorphism tests (see next section), conversions
to DiGraphs objects (see :meth:`~.AbstractLabelledTree.as_digraph`) or
computation of the number of automorphisms constrained by the structure on
children. Providing such methods is the whole purpose of the
:class:`AbstractTree` class.

As a result, the :class:`AbstractTree` class is not meant to be
instantiated, but extended. It is expected that classes extending this one may
also inherit from classes representing iterables, for instance
:class:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableArray` or :class:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableList`

**Constrained Trees**

The tree built from a specific container will reflect the properties of the
container. Indeed, if ``A`` is an iterable class whose elements are linearly
ordered, a class ``B`` extending both of :class:`AbstractTree` and ``A`` will
be such that the children of a node will be linearly ordered. If ``A`` behaves
like a set (i.e. if there is no order on the elements it contains), then two
trees will be considered as equal if one can be obtained from the other
through permutations between the children of a same node (see next section).

**Paths and ID**

It is expected that each element of a set of children should be identified by
its index in the container. This way, any node of the tree can be identified
by a word describing a path from the root node.

**Canonical labellings**

Equality between instances of classes extending both :class:`AbstractTree`
and ``A`` is entirely defined by the equality defined on the elements of
``A``. A canonical labelling of such a tree, however, should be such that
two trees ``a`` and ``b`` satisfying ``a == b`` have the same canonical
labellings. On the other hand, the canonical labellings of trees ``a`` and
``b`` satisfying ``a != b`` are expected to be different.

For this reason, the values returned by the :meth:`canonical_labelling
<AbstractTree.canonical_labelling>` method heavily
depend on the data structure used for a node's children and **should be**
**overridden** by most of the classes extending :class:`AbstractTree` if it is
incoherent with the data structure.

    Abstract Tree.

    There is no data structure defined here, as this class is meant to be
    extended, not instantiated.

    .. rubric:: How should this class be extended?

    A class extending :class:`AbstractTree
    <sage.combinat.abstract_tree.AbstractTree>` should respect several
    assumptions:

    * For a tree ``T``, the call ``iter(T)`` should return an iterator on the
      children of the root ``T``.

    * The :meth:`canonical_labelling
      <AbstractTree.canonical_labelling>` method
      should return the same value for trees that are considered equal (see the
      "canonical labellings" section in the documentation of the
      :class:`AbstractTree <sage.combinat.abstract_tree.AbstractTree>` class).

    * For a tree ``T`` the call ``T.parent().labelled_trees()`` should return
      a parent for labelled trees of the same kind: for example,

      - if ``T`` is a binary tree, ``T.parent()`` is ``BinaryTrees()`` and
        ``T.parent().labelled_trees()`` is ``LabelledBinaryTrees()``

      - if ``T`` is an ordered tree, ``T.parent()`` is ``OrderedTrees()`` and
        ``T.parent().labelled_trees()`` is ``LabelledOrderedTrees()``

        The depth-first pre-order traversal iterator.

        This method iters each node following the depth-first pre-order
        traversal algorithm (recursive implementation). The algorithm
        is::

            yield the root (in the case of binary trees, if it is not
                a leaf);
            then explore each subtree (by the algorithm) from the
                leftmost one to the rightmost one.

        EXAMPLES:

        For example, on the following binary tree `b`::

            |   ___3____      |
            |  /        \     |
            | 1         _7_   |
            |  \       /   \  |
            |   2     5     8 |
            |        / \      |
            |       4   6     |

        (only the nodes shown), the depth-first pre-order traversal
        algorithm explores `b` in the following order of nodes:
        `3,1,2,7,5,4,6,8`.

        Another example::

            |     __1____ |
            |    /  /   / |
            |   2  6   8_ |
            |   |  |  / / |
            |   3_ 7 9 10 |
            |  / /        |
            | 4 5         |

        The algorithm explores this labelled tree in the following
        order: `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10`.

        This method returns a list of sequences of integers. Each of these
        sequences represents a path from the root node to some node. For
        instance, `(1, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3)` represents the node obtained by
        choosing the 1st child of the root node (in the ordering returned
        by ``iter``), then the 3rd child of its child, then the 2nd child
        of the latter, etc. (where the labelling of the children is
        zero-based).

        The root element is represented by the empty tuple ``()``.

        is guaranteed to have labels in `1...n` where `n` is the number of

        Transform a tree into an hexadecimal string.

        The definition of the hexacode is recursive. The first letter is
        the valence of the root as an hexadecimal (up to 15), followed by
        the concatenation of the hexacodes of the subtrees.

        This method only works for trees where every vertex has
        valency at most 15.

class AbstractClonableTree(AbstractTree):

    Abstract Clonable Tree.

    An abstract class for trees with clone protocol (see
    :mod:`~sage.structure.list_clone`). It is expected that classes extending
    this one may also inherit from classes like :class:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableArray` or
    :class:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableList` depending whether one
    wants to build trees where adding a child is allowed.

    .. NOTE:: Due to the limitation of Cython inheritance, one cannot inherit
       here from :class:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableElement`, because
       it would prevent us from later inheriting from
       :class:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableArray` or
       :class:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableList`.

    .. rubric:: How should this class be extended ?

    A class extending :class:`AbstractClonableTree
    <sage.combinat.abstract_tree.AbstractClonableTree>` should satisfy the
    following assumptions:

    * An instantiable class extending :class:`AbstractClonableTree
      <sage.combinat.abstract_tree.AbstractClonableTree>` should also extend
      the :class:`ClonableElement <sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableElement>`
      class or one of its subclasses generally, at least :class:`ClonableArray
      <sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableArray>`.

    * To respect the Clone protocol, the :meth:`AbstractClonableTree.check`
      method should be overridden by the new class.

    See also the assumptions in :class:`AbstractTree`.
    """
    def check(self):
        """
        Check that ``self`` is a correct tree.

        This method does nothing. It is implemented here because many
        extensions of :class:`AbstractClonableTree
        <sage.combinat.abstract_tree.AbstractClonableTree>` also extend
        :class:`sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableElement`, which requires it.

        It should be overridden in subclasses in order to check that the
        characterizing property of the respective kind of tree holds (eg: two
        children for binary trees).

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: OrderedTree([[],[[]]]).check()
            sage: BinaryTree([[],[[],[]]]).check()

        Substitute a subtree.

            The tree ``self`` must be in a mutable state. See
            :mod:`sage.structure.list_clone` for more details about
            mutability.  The default implementation here assume that the
            container of the node implement a method `_setitem` with signature
            `self._setitem(idx, value)`. It is usually provided by inheriting
            from :class:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableArray`.

        INPUT:

        - ``value`` -- the tree to be substituted

            sage: with x.clone() as x:
            ....:     x[0] = OrderedTree([[]])
            sage: x
            [[[]], [[]]]

        One can also substitute at any depth::

            sage: y = OrderedTree(x)
            sage: with x.clone() as x:
            ....:     x[0,0] = OrderedTree([[]])
