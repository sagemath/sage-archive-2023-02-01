def frequency_table(string):

    Return the frequency table corresponding to the given string.

    - A table of frequency of each unique symbol in ``string``. If ``string``
      is an empty string, return an empty table.

class Huffman(SageObject):
    r"""
    This class implements the basic functionalities of Huffman codes.

    It can build a Huffman code from a given string, or from the information
    of a dictionary associating to each key (the elements of the alphabet) a
    weight (most of the time, a probability value or a number of occurrences).

    INPUT:

    - ``source`` -- can be either

        - A string from which the Huffman encoding should be created.

        - A dictionary that associates to each symbol of an alphabet a numeric
          value. If we consider the frequency of each alphabetic symbol, then
          ``source`` is considered as the frequency table of the alphabet with
          each numeric (non-negative integer) value being the number of
          occurrences of a symbol. The numeric values can also represent weights
          of the symbols. In that case, the numeric values are not necessarily
          integers, but can be real numbers.

    In order to construct a Huffman code for an alphabet, we use exactly one of
    the following methods:

    #. Let ``source`` be a string of symbols over an alphabet and feed
       ``source`` to the constructor of this class. Based on the input string, a
       frequency table is constructed that contains the frequency of each unique
       symbol in ``source``. The alphabet in question is then all the unique
       symbols in ``source``. A significant implication of this is that any
       subsequent string that we want to encode must contain only symbols that
       can be found in ``source``.

    #. Let ``source`` be the frequency table of an alphabet. We can feed this
       table to the constructor of this class. The table ``source`` can be a
       table of frequencies or a table of weights.

    In either case, the alphabet must consist of at least two symbols.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.coding.source_coding.huffman import Huffman, frequency_table
        sage: h1 = Huffman("There once was a french fry")
        sage: for letter, code in sorted(h1.encoding_table().items()):
        ....:     print("'{}' : {}".format(letter, code))
        ' ' : 00
        'T' : 11100
        'a' : 0111
        'c' : 1010
        'e' : 100
        'f' : 1011
        'h' : 1100
        'n' : 1101
        'o' : 11101
        'r' : 010
        's' : 11110
        'w' : 11111
        'y' : 0110

    We can obtain the same result by "training" the Huffman code with the
    following table of frequency::

        sage: ft = frequency_table("There once was a french fry")
        sage: sorted(ft.items())
        [(' ', 5),
         ('T', 1),
         ('a', 2),
         ('c', 2),
         ('e', 4),
         ('f', 2),
         ('h', 2),
         ('n', 2),
         ('o', 1),
         ('r', 3),
         ('s', 1),
         ('w', 1),
         ('y', 1)]

        sage: h2 = Huffman(ft)

    Once ``h1`` has been trained, and hence possesses an encoding table,
    it is possible to obtain the Huffman encoding of any string
    (possibly the same) using this code::

        sage: encoded = h1.encode("There once was a french fry"); encoded
        '11100110010001010000111011101101010000111110111111100001110010110101001101101011000010110100110'

    We can decode the above encoded string in the following way::

        sage: h1.decode(encoded)
        'There once was a french fry'

    Obviously, if we try to decode a string using a Huffman instance which
    has been trained on a different sample (and hence has a different encoding
    table), we are likely to get some random-looking string::

        sage: h3 = Huffman("There once were two french fries")
        sage: h3.decode(encoded)
        ' eierhffcoeft TfewrnwrTrsc'

    This does not look like our original string.

    Instead of using frequency, we can assign weights to each alphabetic
    symbol::

        sage: from sage.coding.source_coding.huffman import Huffman
        sage: T = {"a":45, "b":13, "c":12, "d":16, "e":9, "f":5}
        sage: H = Huffman(T)
        sage: L = ["deaf", "bead", "fab", "bee"]
        sage: E = []
        sage: for e in L:
        ....:     E.append(H.encode(e))
        ....:     print(E[-1])
        111110101100
        10111010111
        11000101
        10111011101
        sage: D = []
        sage: for e in E:
        ....:     D.append(H.decode(e))
        ....:     print(D[-1])
        deaf
        bead
        fab
        bee
        sage: D == L
        True

          two children.

        - ``bit`` -- (default: empty string) the bit signifying either the
          left or right branch. The bit "0" denotes the left branch and "1"
          denotes the right branch.

        OUTPUT:

        - An edge list of the Huffman binary tree.
