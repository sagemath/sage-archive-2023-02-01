        Returns the graph as a dictionary.

        INPUT:

        - ``edge_labels`` (boolean) -- whether to include edge labels in the
          output.

        - ``multiple_edges`` (boolean) -- whether to include multiple edges in
          the output.

        OUTPUT:

        The output depends on the input:

        * If ``edge_labels == False`` and ``multiple_edges == False``, the
          output is a dictionary associating to each vertex the list of its
          neighbors.

        * If ``edge_labels == False`` and ``multiple_edges == True``, the output
          is a dictionary the same as previously with one difference : the
          neighbors are listed with multiplicity.

        * If ``edge_labels == True`` and ``multiple_edges == False``, the output
          is a dictionary associating to each vertex `u` [a dictionary
          associating to each vertex `v` incident to `u` the label of edge
          `(u,v)`].

        * If ``edge_labels == True`` and ``multiple_edges == True``, the output
          is a dictionary associating to each vertex `u` [a dictionary
          associating to each vertex `v` incident to `u` [the list of labels of
          all edges between `u` and `v`]].

        Returns the Kirchhoff matrix (a.k.a. the Laplacian) of the graph.

        The Kirchhoff matrix is defined to be `D - M`, where `D` is
        the diagonal degree matrix (each diagonal entry is the degree
        of the corresponding vertex), and `M` is the adjacency matrix.
        If ``normalized`` is ``True``, then the returned matrix is
        `D^{-1/2}(D-M)D^{-1/2}`.

        ( In the special case of DiGraphs, `D` is defined as the diagonal
        in-degree matrix or diagonal out-degree matrix according to the
        value of ``indegree``)

        INPUT:

        - ``weighted`` -- Binary variable :
            - If ``True``, the weighted adjacency matrix is used for `M`,
              and the diagonal matrix `D` takes into account the weight of edges
              (replace in the definition "degree" by "sum of the incident edges" ).
            - Else, each edge is assumed to have weight 1.

            Default is to take weights into consideration if and only if the graph is
            weighted.

        - ``indegree`` -- Binary variable  :
            - If ``True``, each diagonal entry of `D` is equal to the
              in-degree of the corresponding vertex.
            - Else, each diagonal entry of `D` is equal to the
              out-degree of the corresponding vertex.

              By default, ``indegree`` is set to ``True``

            ( This variable only matters when the graph is a digraph )

        - ``normalized`` -- Binary variable :

            - If ``True``, the returned matrix is
              `D^{-1/2}(D-M)D^{-1/2}`, a normalized version of the
              Laplacian matrix.
              (More accurately, the normalizing matrix used is equal to `D^{-1/2}`
              only for non-isolated vertices.  If vertex `i` is isolated, then
              diagonal entry `i` in the matrix is 1, rather than a division by
              zero.)
            - Else, the matrix `D-M` is returned

        Note that any additional keywords will be passed on to either
        the ``adjacency_matrix`` or ``weighted_adjacency_matrix`` method.

    ### Orientations

    def eulerian_orientation(self):
        r"""
        Returns a DiGraph which is an Eulerian orientation of the current graph.

        An Eulerian graph being a graph such that any vertex has an even degree,
        an Eulerian orientation of a graph is an orientation of its edges such
        that each vertex `v` verifies `d^+(v)=d^-(v)=d(v)/2`, where `d^+` and
        `d^-` respectively represent the out-degree and the in-degree of a vertex.

        If the graph is not Eulerian, the orientation verifies for any vertex `v`
        that `| d^+(v)-d^-(v) | \leq 1`.

        ALGORITHM:

        This algorithm is a random walk through the edges of the graph, which
        orients the edges according to the walk. When a vertex is reached which
        has no non-oriented edge ( this vertex must have odd degree ), the
        walk resumes at another vertex of odd degree, if any.

        This algorithm has complexity `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of edges
        in the graph.

        EXAMPLES:

        The CubeGraph with parameter 4, which is regular of even degree, has an
        Eulerian orientation such that `d^+=d^-`::

            sage: g=graphs.CubeGraph(4)
            sage: g.degree()
            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

            [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

        Secondly, the Petersen Graph, which is 3 regular has an orientation
        such that the difference between `d^+` and `d^-` is at most 1::

        (considered as sets of edges) such that the edge set of any
        cycle in the graph can be written as a `Z/2Z` sum of the
        cycles in the basis.

        OUTPUT:

        A list of lists, each of them representing the vertices of a
        cycle in a basis.

        ALGORITHM:

        Myrvold. (See reference code in graphs.planarity).

        Note - the argument on_embedding takes precedence over
        set_embedding. This means that only the on_embedding
        combinatorial embedding will be tested for planarity and no
        _embedding attribute will be set as a result of this function

           planar, returns None as the second entry.

        -  ``on_embedding`` - the embedding dictionary to test
           planarity on. (i.e.: will return True or False only for the given
           embedding.)

        -  ``set_embedding`` - whether or not to set the
           instance field variable that contains a combinatorial embedding
           (clockwise ordering of neighbors at each vertex). This value will
           only be set if a planar embedding is found. It is stored as a

        Tests whether the graph is circular planar (outerplanar)

        A graph is circular planar if it has a planar embedding in which all
        vertices can be drawn in order on a circle. This method can also be used
        to check the existence of a planar embedding in which the vertices of a
        specific set (the *boundary*) can be drawn on a circle, all other
        vertices being drawn inside of the circle. An order can be defined on
        the vertices of the boundary in order to define how they are to appear
        on the circle.

        INPUT:

        - ``kuratowski`` (boolean) - if set to True, returns a tuple with
           boolean first entry and the Kuratowski subgraph or minor as the
           second entry (see OUTPUT below). It is set to ``False`` by default.

        - ``on_embedding`` (boolean) - the embedding dictionary to test
           planarity on. (i.e.: will return ``True`` or ``False`` only for the
           given embedding). It is set to ``False`` by default.

        - ``set_embedding`` (boolean) - whether or not to set the instance field
           variable that contains a combinatorial embedding (clockwise ordering
           of neighbors at each vertex). This value will only be set if a
           circular planar embedding is found. It is stored as a Python dict:
           ``v1: [n1,n2,n3]`` where ``v1`` is a vertex and ``n1,n2,n3`` are its
           neighbors. It is set to ``True`` by default.

        - ``boundary`` - a set of vertices that are required to be drawn on the
          circle, all others being drawn inside of it. It is set to ``None`` by
          default, meaning that *all* vertices should be drawn on the boundary.

        - ``ordered`` (boolean) - whether or not to consider the order of the
           boundary. It is set to ``False`` by default, and required
           ``boundary`` to be defined.

        - ``set_pos`` - whether or not to set the position dictionary (for
           plotting) to reflect the combinatorial embedding.  Note that this
           value will default to False if set_emb is set to False. Also, the
           position dictionary will only be updated if a circular planar
           embedding is found.

        OUTPUT:

        The method returns ``True`` if the graph is circular planar, and
        ``False`` if it is not.

        If ``kuratowski`` is set to ``True``, then this function will return a
        tuple, whose first entry is a boolean and whose second entry is the
        Kuratowski subgraph or minor isolated by the Boyer-Myrvold
        algorithm. Note that this graph might contain a vertex or edges that
        were not in the initial graph. These would be elements referred to below
        as parts of the wheel and the star, which were added to the graph to
        require that the boundary can be drawn on the boundary of a disc, with
        all other vertices drawn inside (and no edge crossings). For more
        information, see [Kirkman]_.

        ALGORITHM:

        This is a linear time algorithm to test for circular planarity. It
        relies on the edge-addition planarity algorithm due to
        Boyer-Myrvold. We accomplish linear time for circular planarity by
        modifying the graph before running the general planarity
        algorithm.

        Returns the minimal genus of the graph. The genus of a compact
        surface is the number of handles it has. The genus of a graph is
        the minimal genus of the surface it can be embedded into.

        Note - This function uses Euler's formula and thus it is necessary
        to consider only connected graphs.

        INPUT:


        -  ``set_embedding (boolean)`` - whether or not to
           store an embedding attribute of the computed (minimal) genus of the
           graph. (Default is True).

        -  ``on_embedding (dict)`` - a combinatorial embedding
           to compute the genus of the graph on. Note that this must be a
           valid embedding for the graph. The dictionary structure is given
           by: vertex1: [neighbor1, neighbor2, neighbor3], vertex2: [neighbor]
           where there is a key for each vertex in the graph and a (clockwise)
           ordered list of each vertex's neighbors as values. on_embedding
           takes precedence over a stored _embedding attribute if minimal is
           set to False. Note that as a shortcut, the user can enter
           on_embedding=True to compute the genus on the current _embedding
           attribute. (see eg's.)

        -  ``minimal (boolean)`` - whether or not to compute
           the minimal genus of the graph (i.e., testing all embeddings). If
           minimal is False, then either maximal must be True or on_embedding
           must not be None. If on_embedding is not None, it will take
           priority over minimal. Similarly, if maximal is True, it will take
           priority over minimal.

        -  ``maximal (boolean)`` - whether or not to compute
           the maximal genus of the graph (i.e., testing all embeddings). If
           maximal is False, then either minimal must be True or on_embedding
           must not be None. If on_embedding is not None, it will take
           priority over maximal. However, maximal takes priority over the
           default minimal.

        -  ``circular (boolean)`` - whether or not to compute
           the genus preserving a planar embedding of the boundary. (Default
           is False). If circular is True, on_embedding is not a valid
           option.

        -  ``ordered (boolean)`` - if circular is True, then
           whether or not the boundary order may be permuted. (Default is
           True, which means the boundary order is preserved.)

        Computes the blocks and cut vertices of the graph.

        In the case of a digraph, this computation is done on the underlying
        graph.

        A cut vertex is one whose deletion increases the number of
        connected components. A block is a maximal induced subgraph which
        itself has no cut vertices. Two distinct blocks cannot overlap in
        more than a single cut vertex.

        OUTPUT: ``( B, C )``, where ``B`` is a list of blocks- each is
        a list of vertices and the blocks are the corresponding induced
        subgraphs-and ``C`` is a list of cut vertices.

        ALGORITHM:

          We implement the algorithm proposed by Tarjan in [Tarjan72]_. The
          original version is recursive. We emulate the recursion using a stack.

        r"""
        Returns a tree of minimum weight connecting the given
        set of vertices.

        Definition :

        Computing a minimum spanning tree in a graph can be done in `n
        \log(n)` time (and in linear time if all weights are equal) where
        `n = V + E`. On the other hand, if one is given a large (possibly
        weighted) graph and a subset of its vertices, it is NP-Hard to
        find a tree of minimum weight connecting the given set of
        vertices, which is then called a Steiner Tree.

        `Wikipedia article on Steiner Trees
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_tree_problem>`_.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` -- the vertices to be connected by the Steiner
          Tree.

        - ``weighted`` (boolean) -- Whether to consider the graph as
          weighted, and use each edge's label as a weight, considering
          ``None`` as a weight of `1`. If ``weighted=False`` (default)
          all edges are considered to have a weight of `1`.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.


        .. NOTE::

            * This problem being defined on undirected graphs, the
              orientation is not considered if the current graph is
              actually a digraph.

            * The graph is assumed not to have multiple edges.

        ALGORITHM:

        Solved through Linear Programming.

        COMPLEXITY:

        NP-Hard.

        Note that this algorithm first checks whether the given
        set of vertices induces a connected graph, returning one of its
        spanning trees if ``weighted`` is set to ``False``, and thus
        answering very quickly in some cases

            sage: st.is_tree()
            True

        And all the 5 vertices are contained in this tree ::

            sage: all([v in st for v in g.vertices()[:5] ])
            True

        An exception is raised when the problem is impossible, i.e.
        if the given vertices are not all included in the same
        connected component ::

        ALGORITHM:

        Mixed Integer Linear Program. The formulation can be found
        in [LPForm]_.

        There are at least two possible rewritings of this method
        which do not use Linear Programming:

            * The algorithm presented in the paper entitled "A short
              proof of the tree-packing theorem", by Thomas Kaiser
              [KaisPacking]_.

            * The implementation of a Matroid class and of the Matroid
              Union Theorem (see section 42.3 of [SchrijverCombOpt]_),
              applied to the cycle Matroid (see chapter 51 of
              [SchrijverCombOpt]_).

        EXAMPLES:

        The Petersen Graph does have a spanning tree (it is connected)::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: [T] = g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(1)
            sage: T.is_tree()
            True

        Though, it does not have 2 edge-disjoint trees (as it has less
        than `2(|V|-1)` edges)::

            sage: g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(2)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: This graph does not contain the required number of trees/arborescences !

        By Edmond's theorem, a graph which is `k`-connected always has `k` edge-disjoint
        arborescences, regardless of the root we pick::

            sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(28,.3) # reduced from 30 to 28, cf. #9584
            sage: k = Integer(g.edge_connectivity())
            sage: arborescences = g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(k)  # long time (up to 15s on sage.math, 2011)
            sage: all([a.is_directed_acyclic() for a in arborescences])  # long time
            True
            sage: all([a.is_connected() for a in arborescences])  # long time
            True

        In the undirected case, we can only ensure half of it::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(30,.3)
            sage: k = floor(Integer(g.edge_connectivity())/2)
            sage: trees = g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(k)
            sage: all([t.is_tree() for t in trees])
            True

        Or on Petersen's graph, with the corresponding bipartition of
        the vertex set::

           sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
           sage: g.edge_cut(0, 3, vertices=True)
           [3, [(0, 1, None), (0, 4, None), (0, 5, None)], [[0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]]

        If the graph is a path with randomly weighted edges::

           sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(15)
           sage: for (u,v) in g.edge_iterator(labels=None):
           ...      g.set_edge_label(u,v,random())

        The edge cut between the two ends is the edge of minimum weight::

           sage: minimum = min([l for u,v,l in g.edge_iterator()])
           sage: minimum == g.edge_cut(0, 14, use_edge_labels=True)

           sage: g.edge_label(e[0],e[1]) == minimum
           True

        The two sides of the edge cut are obviously shorter paths::

           sage: value,edges,[set1,set2] = g.edge_cut(0, 14, use_edge_labels=True, vertices=True)
           sage: g.subgraph(set1).is_isomorphic(graphs.PathGraph(len(set1)))

        Returns a minimum vertex cut between non-adjacent vertices `s` and `t`
        represented by a list of vertices.

        A vertex cut between two non-adjacent vertices is a set `U`
        of vertices of self such that the graph obtained by removing
        `U` from self is disconnected. For more information, see the
        `Wikipedia article on cuts
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_%28graph_theory%29>`_.

        INPUT:

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``). When set to
          ``True``, only the size of the minimum cut is returned.

        - ``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to
          ``True``, also returns the two sets of vertices that
          are disconnected by the cut. Implies ``value_only``
          set to False.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see

          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        OUTPUT:

        Real number or tuple, depending on the given arguments
        (examples are given below).

        EXAMPLE:

           sage: g.vertex_cut(1, 16, value_only=True)
           3

        In the bipartite complete graph `K_{2,8}`, a cut between the two
        vertices in the size `2` part consists of the other `8` vertices::

           sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(2, 8)

    def multiway_cut(self, vertices, value_only = False, use_edge_labels = False, solver = None, verbose = 0):
        r"""
        Returns a minimum edge multiway cut corresponding to the

        ( cf. http://www.d.kth.se/~viggo/wwwcompendium/node92.html )
        represented by a list of edges.

        A multiway cut for a vertex set `S` in a graph or a digraph
        `G` is a set `C` of edges such that any two vertices `u,v`
        in `S` are disconnected when removing the edges from `C` from `G`.

        Such a cut is said to be minimum when its cardinality
        (or weight) is minimum.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` (iterable)-- the set of vertices

        - ``value_only`` (boolean)

            - When set to ``True``, only the value of a minimum
              multiway cut is returned.

            - When set to ``False`` (default), the list of edges
              is returned

            - When set to ``True``, computes a weighted minimum cut

          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see

          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        EXAMPLES:

        Of course, a multiway cut between two vertices correspond
        to a minimum edge cut ::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.edge_cut(0,3) == g.multiway_cut([0,3], value_only = True)
            True

        As Petersen's graph is `3`-regular, a minimum multiway cut
        between three vertices contains at most `2\times 3` edges
        (which could correspond to the neighborhood of 2
        vertices)::

            sage: g.multiway_cut([0,3,9], value_only = True) == 2*3
            True

        In this case, though, the vertices are an independent set.
        If we pick instead vertices `0,9,` and `7`, we can save `4`
        edges in the multiway cut ::

            sage: g.multiway_cut([0,7,9], value_only = True) == 2*3 - 1
            True

        This example, though, does not work in the directed case anymore,
        as it is not possible in Petersen's graph to mutualise edges ::

            sage: g = DiGraph(g)
            sage: g.multiway_cut([0,7,9], value_only = True) == 3*3
            True

        Of course, a multiway cut between the whole vertex set
        contains all the edges of the graph::

            sage: C = g.multiway_cut(g.vertices())
            sage: set(C) == set(g.edges())

        INPUT:

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``)

          - When set to ``True`` (default), only the value is returned.

          - When set to ``False``, both the value and a maximum edge cut
            are returned.

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - When set to ``True``, computes a maximum weighted cut
            where each edge has a weight defined by its label. (If
            an edge has no label, `1` is assumed.)

          - When set to ``False``, each edge has weight `1`.

        - ``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - When set to ``True``, also returns the two sets of
            vertices that are disconnected by the cut. This implies
            ``value_only=False``.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        EXAMPLE:

        Quite obviously, the max cut of a bipartite graph
        is the number of edges, and the two sets of vertices
        are the the two sides ::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(5,6)
            sage: [ value, edges, [ setA, setB ]] = g.max_cut(vertices=True)
            sage: value == 5*6
            True
            sage: bsetA, bsetB  = map(list,g.bipartite_sets())
            sage: (bsetA == setA and bsetB == setB ) or ((bsetA == setB and bsetB == setA ))
            True

        The max cut of a Petersen graph::

           sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph()
           sage: g.max_cut()
           12

    def longest_path(self, s=None, t=None, use_edge_labels=False, algorithm="MILP", solver=None, verbose=0):
        r"""
        Returns a longest path of ``self``.

        INPUT:

        - ``s`` (vertex) -- forces the source of the path (the method then
          returns the longest path starting at ``s``). The argument is set to
          ``None`` by default, which means that no constraint is set upon the
          first vertex in the path.

        - ``t`` (vertex) -- forces the destination of the path (the method then
          returns the longest path ending at ``t``). The argument is set to
          ``None`` by default, which means that no constraint is set upon the
          last vertex in the path.

        - ``use_edge_labels`` (boolean) -- whether the labels on the edges are
          to be considered as weights (a label set to ``None`` or ``{}`` being
          considered as a weight of `1`). Set to ``False`` by default.

        - ``algorithm`` -- one of ``"MILP"`` (default) or ``"backtrack"``. Two
          remarks on this respect:

              * While the MILP formulation returns an exact answer, the
                backtrack algorithm is a randomized heuristic.

              * As the backtrack algorithm does not support edge weighting,
                setting ``use_edge_labels=True`` will force the use of the MILP
                algorithm.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify the Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        .. NOTE::

            The length of a path is assumed to be the number of its edges, or
            the sum of their labels.

        OUTPUT:

        A subgraph of ``self`` corresponding to a (directed if ``self`` is
        directed) longest path. If ``use_edge_labels == True``, a pair ``weight,
        path`` is returned.

        ALGORITHM:

        Mixed Integer Linear Programming. (This problem is known to be NP-Hard).

        EXAMPLES:

        Petersen's graph being hypohamiltonian, it has a longest path
        of length `n-2`::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: lp = g.longest_path()
            sage: lp.order() >= g.order() - 2
            True

        The heuristic totally agrees::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.longest_path(algorithm="backtrack").edges()
            [(0, 1, None), (1, 2, None), (2, 3, None), (3, 4, None), (4, 9, None), (5, 7, None), (5, 8, None), (6, 8, None), (6, 9, None)]

        Let us compute longest paths on random graphs with random weights. Each
        time, we ensure the resulting graph is indeed a path::

            sage: for i in range(20):
            ...       g = graphs.RandomGNP(15, 0.3)
            ...       for u, v in g.edges(labels=False):
            ...           g.set_edge_label(u, v, random())
            ...       lp = g.longest_path()
            ...       if (not lp.is_forest() or
            ...           not max(lp.degree()) <= 2 or
            ...           not lp.is_connected()):
            ...           print("Error!")
            ...           break

        TESTS:

        The argument ``algorithm`` must be either ``'backtrack'`` or
        ``'MILP'``::

            sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().longest_path(algorithm="abc")
            Traceback (most recent call last):

            sage: lp1[0] == lp2[0]
            True

        Solves the traveling salesman problem (TSP)

        Given a graph (resp. a digraph) `G` with weighted edges, the traveling
        salesman problem consists in finding a Hamiltonian cycle (resp. circuit)
        of the graph of minimum cost.

        This TSP is one of the most famous NP-Complete problems, this function
        can thus be expected to take some time before returning its result.

        INPUT:

        - ``use_edge_labels`` (boolean) -- whether to consider the weights of
          the edges.

              - If set to ``False`` (default), all edges are assumed to weight
                `1`

              - If set to ``True``, the weights are taken into account, and the
                circuit returned is the one minimizing the sum of the weights.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``constraint_generation`` (boolean) -- whether to use constraint
          generation when solving the Mixed Integer Linear Program.

          When ``constraint_generation = None``, constraint generation is used
          whenever the graph has a density larger than 70%.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``verbose_constraints`` -- whether to display which constraints are
          being generated.

        OUTPUT:

        A solution to the TSP, as a ``Graph`` object whose vertex set is `V(G)`,
        and whose edges are only those of the solution.

        ALGORITHM:

        This optimization problem is solved through the use of Linear
        Programming.

        NOTE:

        - This function is correctly defined for both graph and digraphs.  In
          the second case, the returned cycle is a circuit of optimal cost.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Heawood graph is known to be Hamiltonian::

            sage: g = graphs.HeawoodGraph()
            sage: tsp = g.traveling_salesman_problem()
            sage: tsp
            TSP from Heawood graph: Graph on 14 vertices

        The solution to the TSP has to be connected ::

            sage: tsp.is_connected()
            True

        It must also be a `2`-regular graph::

            sage: tsp.is_regular(k=2)
            True

        And obviously it is a subgraph of the Heawood graph::

            sage: all([ e in g.edges() for e in tsp.edges()])
            True

        On the other hand, the Petersen Graph is known not to
        be Hamiltonian::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: tsp = g.traveling_salesman_problem()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: The given graph is not hamiltonian


        One easy way to change is is obviously to add to this graph the edges
        corresponding to a Hamiltonian cycle.

        If we do this by setting the cost of these new edges to `2`, while the
        others are set to `1`, we notice that not all the edges we added are
        used in the optimal solution ::

            sage: for u, v in g.edges(labels = None):
            ...      g.set_edge_label(u,v,1)

            sage: cycle = graphs.CycleGraph(10)
            sage: for u,v in cycle.edges(labels = None):
            ...      if not g.has_edge(u,v):
            ...          g.add_edge(u,v)
            ...      g.set_edge_label(u,v,2)

            sage: tsp = g.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels = True)
            sage: sum( tsp.edge_labels() ) < 2*10
            True

        If we pick `1/2` instead of `2` as a cost for these new edges, they
        clearly become the optimal solution::

            sage: for u,v in cycle.edges(labels = None):
            ...      g.set_edge_label(u,v,1/2)

            sage: tsp = g.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels = True)
            sage: sum( tsp.edge_labels() ) == (1/2)*10
            True

        TESTS:

        Comparing the results returned according to the value of
        ``constraint_generation``. First, for graphs::

            sage: from operator import itemgetter
            sage: n = 20
            sage: for i in range(20):
            ...       g = Graph()
            ...       g.allow_multiple_edges(False)
            ...       for u,v in graphs.RandomGNP(n,.2).edges(labels = False):
            ...            g.add_edge(u,v,round(random(),5))
            ...       for u,v in graphs.CycleGraph(n).edges(labels = False):
            ...            if not g.has_edge(u,v):
            ...                g.add_edge(u,v,round(random(),5))
            ...       v1 = g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = False, use_edge_labels = True)
            ...       v2 = g.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels = True)
            ...       c1 = sum(map(itemgetter(2), v1.edges()))
            ...       c2 = sum(map(itemgetter(2), v2.edges()))
            ...       if c1 != c2:
            ...           print "Error !",c1,c2
            ...           break

        Then for digraphs::

            sage: from operator import itemgetter
            sage: set_random_seed(0)
            sage: n = 20

            ...            g.add_edge(u,v,round(random(),5))
            ...       for u,v in digraphs.Circuit(n).edges(labels = False):
            ...            if not g.has_edge(u,v):
            ...                g.add_edge(u,v,round(random(),5))
            ...       v2 = g.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels = True)
            ...       v1 = g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = False, use_edge_labels = True)
            ...       c1 = sum(map(itemgetter(2), v1.edges()))
            ...       c2 = sum(map(itemgetter(2), v2.edges()))

            ...           print "Without constraint generation :",c1

    def hamiltonian_cycle(self, algorithm='tsp' ):
        r"""
        Returns a Hamiltonian cycle/circuit of the current graph/digraph

        A graph (resp. digraph) is said to be Hamiltonian
        if it contains as a subgraph a cycle (resp. a circuit)
        going through all the vertices.

        Computing a Hamiltonian cycle/circuit being NP-Complete,
        this algorithm could run for some time depending on
        the instance.

        ALGORITHM:

        See ``Graph.traveling_salesman_problem`` for 'tsp' algorithm and
        ``find_hamiltonian`` from ``sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx``
        for 'backtrack' algorithm.

        INPUT:

            - ``algorithm`` - one of 'tsp' or 'backtrack'.

        OUTPUT:

        If using the 'tsp' algorithm, returns a Hamiltonian cycle/circuit if it
        exists; otherwise, raises a ``ValueError`` exception. If using the
        'backtrack' algorithm, returns a pair (B,P). If B is True then P is a
        Hamiltonian cycle and if B is False, P is a longest path found by the
        algorithm. Observe that if B is False, the graph may still be Hamiltonian.
        The 'backtrack' algorithm is only implemented for undirected
        graphs.

        .. WARNING::

            The 'backtrack' algorithm may loop endlessly on graphs
            with vertices of degree 1.

        NOTE:

        This function, as ``is_hamiltonian``, computes a Hamiltonian
        cycle if it exists : the user should *NOT* test for
        Hamiltonicity using ``is_hamiltonian`` before calling this
        function, as it would result in computing it twice.

        The backtrack algorithm is only implemented for undirected graphs.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Heawood Graph is known to be Hamiltonian ::

            sage: g = graphs.HeawoodGraph()
            sage: g.hamiltonian_cycle()
            TSP from Heawood graph: Graph on 14 vertices

        The Petersen Graph, though, is not ::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.hamiltonian_cycle()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: The given graph is not hamiltonian

        Now, using the backtrack algorithm in the Heawood graph ::

            sage: G=graphs.HeawoodGraph()
            sage: G.hamiltonian_cycle(algorithm='backtrack')
            (True, [11, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 0, 13, 12])

        And now in the Petersen graph ::

            sage: G=graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: G.hamiltonian_cycle(algorithm='backtrack')
            (False, [6, 8, 5, 0, 1, 2, 7, 9, 4, 3])

        Finally, we test the algorithm in a cube graph, which is Hamiltonian ::

            sage: G=graphs.CubeGraph(3)
            sage: G.hamiltonian_cycle(algorithm='backtrack')

        r"""
        Computes the minimum feedback vertex set of a (di)graph.

        The minimum feedback vertex set of a (di)graph is a set of vertices that
        intersect all of its cycles.  Equivalently, a minimum feedback vertex
        set of a (di)graph is a set `S` of vertices such that the digraph `G-S`
        is acyclic. For more information, see :wikipedia:`Feedback_vertex_set`.

        INPUT:

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - When set to ``True``, only the minimum cardinal of a minimum vertex
            set is returned.

          - When set to ``False``, the ``Set`` of vertices of a minimal feedback
            vertex set is returned.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used,
          see the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``constraint_generation`` (boolean) -- whether to use constraint
          generation when solving the Mixed Integer Linear Program (default:
          ``True``).

        ALGORITHMS:

        (Constraints generation)

        When the parameter ``constraint_generation`` is enabled (default) the
        following MILP formulation is used to solve the problem:

        .. MATH::

            \mbox{Minimize : }&\sum_{v\in G} b_{v}\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\\
            &\forall C\text{ circuits }\subseteq G, \sum_{v\in C}b_{v}\geq 1\\

        As the number of circuits contained in a graph is exponential, this LP
        is solved through constraint generation. This means that the solver is
        sequentially asked to solve the problem, knowing only a portion of the
        circuits contained in `G`, each time adding to the list of its
        constraints the circuit which its last answer had left intact.

        (Another formulation based on an ordering of the vertices)

        When the graph is directed, a second (and very slow) formulation is
        available, which should only be used to check the result of the first
        implementation in case of doubt.

        .. MATH::

            \mbox{Minimize : }&\sum_{v\in G} b_v\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\\
            &\forall (u,v)\in G, d_u-d_v+nb_u+nb_v\geq 0\\
            &\forall u\in G, 0\leq d_u\leq |G|\\

        A brief explanation:

        An acyclic digraph can be seen as a poset, and every poset has a linear
        extension. This means that in any acyclic digraph the vertices can be
        ordered with a total order `<` in such a way that if `(u,v)\in G`, then
        `u<v`.  Thus, this linear program is built in order to assign to each
        vertex `v` a number `d_v\in [0,\dots,n-1]` such that if there exists an
        edge `(u,v)\in G` then either `d_v<d_u` or one of `u` or `v` is removed.
        The number of vertices removed is then minimized, which is the
        objective.

        EXAMPLES:

        The necessary example::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: fvs = g.feedback_vertex_set()
            sage: len(fvs)
            3
            sage: g.delete_vertices(fvs)
            sage: g.is_forest()
            True

        In a digraph built from a graph, any edge is replaced by arcs going in
        the two opposite directions, thus creating a cycle of length two.
        Hence, to remove all the cycles from the graph, each edge must see one
        of its neighbors removed: a feedback vertex set is in this situation a
        vertex cover::

            sage: cycle = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
            sage: dcycle = DiGraph(cycle)
            sage: cycle.vertex_cover(value_only=True)
            3
            sage: feedback = dcycle.feedback_vertex_set()
            sage: len(feedback)
            3
            sage: (u,v,l) = cycle.edge_iterator().next()
            sage: u in feedback or v in feedback
            True

        For a circuit, the minimum feedback arc set is clearly `1`::

            sage: circuit = digraphs.Circuit(5)
            sage: circuit.feedback_vertex_set(value_only=True) == 1
            True

        TESTS:

        Comparing with/without constraint generation::

            sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(10,.3)
            sage: x = g.feedback_vertex_set(value_only = True)
            sage: y = g.feedback_vertex_set(value_only = True,
            ....:          constraint_generation = False)

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``)

          - When set to ``True``, only the value of a maximal

        - ``solver`` -- Specify a Linear Program solver to be used.

          ``MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve`` for more information.

          Only useful when LP is used to solve the flow problem.

        - ``verbose`` (integer) -- sets the level of verbosity. Set to 0
          by default (quiet).

          Only useful when LP is used to solve the flow problem.

        .. NOTE::

           Even though the two different implementations are meant to
           return the same Flow values, they can not be expected to
           return the same Flow graphs.

           Besides, the use of Linear Programming may possibly mean a
           (slight) numerical noise.

        The flow method can be used to compute a matching in a bipartite graph
        by linking a source `s` to all the vertices of the first set and linking
        a sink `t` to all the vertices of the second set, then computing
        a maximum `s-t` flow ::

        ALGORITHM:

        EXAMPLE:

        An easy way to obtain a satisfiable multiflow is to compute
        a matching in a graph, and to consider the paired vertices
        as terminals ::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: matching = [(u,v) for u,v,_ in g.matching()]
            sage: h = g.multicommodity_flow(matching)
            sage: len(h)
            5

        We could also have considered ``g`` as symmetric and computed
        the multiflow in this version instead. In this case, however
        edges can be used in both directions at the same time::

            sage: h = DiGraph(g).multicommodity_flow(matching)
            sage: len(h)
            5

        An exception is raised when the problem has no solution ::

            sage: h = g.multicommodity_flow([(u,v,3) for u,v in matching])

            `k`-connected if there are `k` disjoint paths between any two
            vertices `u, v`). If you do not want to consider strong
            connectivity, the best is probably to convert your ``DiGraph``
            object to a ``Graph`` object, and compute the connectivity of this
            other graph.

        INPUT:

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``)

          - When set to ``True`` (default), only the value is returned.

          - When set to ``False``, both the value and a minimum edge cut
            are returned.

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - When set to ``True``, computes a weighted minimum cut
            where each edge has a weight defined by its label. (If
            an edge has no label, `1` is assumed.)

          - When set to ``False``, each edge has weight `1`.

        - ``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - When set to ``True``, also returns the two sets of
            vertices that are disconnected by the cut. Implies
            ``value_only=False``.

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        EXAMPLES:

        A basic application on the PappusGraph::

           sage: g = graphs.PappusGraph()
           sage: g.edge_connectivity()
           3

        The edge connectivity of a complete graph ( and of a random graph )
        is its minimum degree, and one of the two parts of the bipartition
        is reduced to only one vertex. The cutedges isomorphic to a
        Star graph::

           sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
           sage: [ value, edges, [ setA, setB ]] = g.edge_connectivity(vertices=True)
           sage: print value
           4
           sage: len(setA) == 1 or len(setB) == 1
           True
           sage: cut = Graph()
           sage: cut.add_edges(edges)
           sage: cut.is_isomorphic(graphs.StarGraph(4))
           True

        Even if obviously in any graph we know that the edge connectivity
        is less than the minimum degree of the graph::

           sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(10,.3)
           sage: min(g.degree()) >= g.edge_connectivity()
           True

        If we build a tree then assign to its edges a random value, the
        minimum cut will be the edge with minimum value::

           sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(15,.5)
           sage: tree = Graph()
           sage: tree.add_edges(g.min_spanning_tree())
           sage: for u,v in tree.edge_iterator(labels=None):
           ...        tree.set_edge_label(u,v,random())
           sage: minimum = min([l for u,v,l in tree.edge_iterator()])
           sage: [value, [(u,v,l)]] = tree.edge_connectivity(value_only=False, use_edge_labels=True)
           sage: l == minimum
           True

        When ``value_only = True``, this function is optimized for small
        connectivity values and does not need to build a linear program.

        It is the case for connected graphs which are not
        connected ::

           sage: g = 2 * graphs.PetersenGraph()
           sage: g.edge_connectivity()
           0.0

           sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(10)
           sage: g.edge_connectivity()
           1.0

        For directed graphs, the strong connectivity is tested
        through the dedicated function ::

           sage: g = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(3)
           sage: g.edge_connectivity()

            are of the same simple type, then there should not be
            a problem with how the vertices will be sorted. However,
            if you need to guarantee a total order for the sort,

        INPUT:

        - ``labels`` - default: ``True`` - if ``False``, each
          edge is simply a pair (u,v) of vertices.

        - ``sort`` - default: ``True`` - if ``True``, edges are
          sorted according to the default ordering.

        - ``key`` - default: ``None`` - a function  takes an edge
          (a pair or a triple, according to the ``labels`` keyword)
          as its one argument and returns a value that can be used
          for comparisons in the sorting algorithm.

        OUTPUT: A list of tuples. It is safe to change the returned list.

        .. warning::

            Since any object may be a vertex, there is no guarantee
            that any two vertices will be comparable, and thus no
            guarantee how two edges may compare.  With default
            objects for vertices (all integers), or when all the
            vertices are of the same simple type, then there should
            not be a problem with how the vertices will be sorted.
            However, if you need to guarantee a total order for
            the sorting of the edges, use the ``key`` argument,
            as illustrated in the examples below.

        """
        Returns the subgraph containing the given vertices and edges.

        If either vertices or edges are not specified, they are assumed to be
        all vertices or edges. If edges are not specified, returns the subgraph
        induced by the vertices.

        INPUT:


        -  ``inplace`` - Using inplace is True will simply
           delete the extra vertices and edges from the current graph. This
           will modify the graph.

        -  ``vertices`` - Vertices can be a single vertex or an
           iterable container of vertices, e.g. a list, set, graph, file or
           numeric array. If not passed, defaults to the entire graph.

        -  ``edges`` - As with vertices, edges can be a single
           edge or an iterable container of edges (e.g., a list, set, file,
           numeric array, etc.). If not edges are not specified, then all
           edges are assumed and the returned graph is an induced subgraph. In
           the case of multiple edges, specifying an edge as (u,v) means to
           keep all edges (u,v), regardless of the label.

        -  ``vertex_property`` - If specified, this is
           expected to be a function on vertices, which is intersected with
           the vertices specified, if any are.

        -  ``edge_property`` - If specified, this is expected
           to be a function on edges, which is intersected with the edges
           specified, if any are.

        - ``algorithm`` - If ``algorithm=delete`` or ``inplace=True``,
          then the graph is constructed by deleting edges and
          vertices.  If ``add``, then the graph is constructed by
          building a new graph from the appropriate vertices and
          edges.  If not specified, then the algorithm is chosen based
          on the number of vertices in the subgraph.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Petersen graph contains the path graph `P_5`::

             sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
             sage: h1 = g.subgraph_search(graphs.PathGraph(5)); h1
             Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 5 vertices

             sage: I1.vertices(); I1.edges(labels=False)
             [0, 1, 2, 3, 8]
             [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 8)]

        It also contains the claw `K_{1,3}`::

             sage: h2 = g.subgraph_search(graphs.ClawGraph()); h2
             Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 4 vertices
             sage: h2.vertices(); h2.edges(labels=False)
             [0, 1, 4, 5]

             sage: I2 = g.subgraph_search(graphs.ClawGraph(), induced=True); I2
             Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 4 vertices
             sage: I2.vertices(); I2.edges(labels=False)
             [0, 1, 4, 5]
             [(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5)]

        Of course the induced copies are isomorphic to the graphs we were
        looking for::

             sage: I1.is_isomorphic(graphs.PathGraph(5))
             True
             sage: I2.is_isomorphic(graphs.ClawGraph())
             True

        However, the Petersen graph does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to
        `K_3`::

             sage: g.subgraph_search(graphs.CompleteGraph(3)) is None
             True

        Nor does it contain a nonempty induced subgraph isomorphic to `P_6`::

             sage: g.subgraph_search(graphs.PathGraph(6), induced=True) is None
             True

        The empty graph is a subgraph of every graph::

             sage: g.subgraph_search(graphs.EmptyGraph())
             Graph on 0 vertices
             sage: g.subgraph_search(graphs.EmptyGraph(), induced=True)
             Graph on 0 vertices

        The subgraph may just have edges missing::

            sage: k3=graphs.CompleteGraph(3); p3=graphs.PathGraph(3)
            sage: k3.relabel(list('abc'))
            sage: s=k3.subgraph_search(p3)
            sage: s.edges(labels=False)
            [('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c')]

        Of course, `P_3` is not an induced subgraph of `K_3`, though::

            sage: k3=graphs.CompleteGraph(3); p3=graphs.PathGraph(3)
            sage: k3.relabel(list('abc'))
            sage: k3.subgraph_search(p3, induced=True) is None

        Tests whether the given graph is chordal.

        A Graph `G` is said to be chordal if it contains no induced hole (a
        cycle of length at least 4).

        Alternatively, chordality can be defined using a Perfect Elimination
        Order :

        A Perfect Elimination Order of a graph `G` is an ordering `v_1,...,v_n`
        of its vertex set such that for all `i`, the neighbors of `v_i` whose
        index is greater that `i` induce a complete subgraph in `G`. Hence, the
        graph `G` can be totally erased by successively removing vertices whose
        neighborhood is a clique (also called *simplicial* vertices)
        [Fulkerson65]_.

        (It can be seen that if `G` contains an induced hole, then it can not
        have a perfect elimination order. Indeed, if we write `h_1,...,h_k` the
        `k` vertices of such a hole, then the first of those vertices to be
        removed would have two non-adjacent neighbors in the graph.)

        A Graph is then chordal if and only if it has a Perfect Elimination
        Order.

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` (boolean) -- Whether to return a certificate.

            * If ``certificate = False`` (default), returns ``True`` or
              ``False`` accordingly.

            * If ``certificate = True``, returns :

                * ``(True, peo)`` when the graph is chordal, where ``peo`` is a
                  perfect elimination order of its vertices.

                * ``(False, Hole)`` when the graph is not chordal, where
                  ``Hole`` (a ``Graph`` object) is an induced subgraph of
                  ``self`` isomorphic to a hole.

        - ``algorithm`` -- Two algorithms are available for this method (see
          next section), which can be selected by setting ``algorithm = "A"`` or
          ``algorithm = "B"`` (default). While they will agree on whether the
          given graph is chordal, they can not be expected to return the same
          certificates.

        ALGORITHM:

        This algorithm works through computing a Lex BFS on the graph, then
        checking whether the order is a Perfect Elimination Order by computing
        for each vertex `v` the subgraph induces by its non-deleted neighbors,
        then testing whether this graph is complete.

        This problem can be solved in `O(m)` [Rose75]_ ( where `m` is the number
        of edges in the graph ) but this implementation is not linear because of
        the complexity of Lex BFS.

        .. NOTE::

            Because of a past bug (#11735, #11961), the first implementation
            (algorithm A) of this method sometimes returned as certificates
            subgraphs which were **not** holes. Since then, this bug has been
            fixed and the values are now double-checked before being returned,
            so that the algorithm only returns correct values or raises an
            exception. In the case where an exception is raised, the user is
            advised to switch to the other algorithm. And to **please** report
            the bug :-)

        EXAMPLES:

        The lexicographic product of a Path and a Complete Graph
        is chordal ::

            sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(5).lexicographic_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(3))
            sage: g.is_chordal()
            True

        The same goes with the product of a random lobster
        ( which is a tree ) and a Complete Graph ::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomLobster(10,.5,.5).lexicographic_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(3))
            sage: g.is_chordal()
            True

        The disjoint union of chordal graphs is still chordal::

            sage: (2*g).is_chordal()
            True

        Let us check the certificate given by Sage is indeed a perfect elimintion order::

            sage: (_, peo) = g.is_chordal(certificate = True)
            sage: for v in peo:
            ...       if not g.subgraph(g.neighbors(v)).is_clique():
            ...            print "This should never happen !"
            ...       g.delete_vertex(v)
            sage: print "Everything is fine !"
            Everything is fine !

        Of course, the Petersen Graph is not chordal as it has girth 5 ::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.girth()
            5
            sage: g.is_chordal()
            False

        We can even obtain such a cycle as a certificate ::

            sage: (_, hole) = g.is_chordal(certificate = True)
            sage: hole
            Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 5 vertices
            sage: hole.is_isomorphic(graphs.CycleGraph(5))
            True

        TESTS:

        This shouldn't fail (trac 10899)::

            sage: Graph(1).is_chordal()
            True
            sage: for g in graphs(5):
            ...     try:
            ...         forget = g.is_chordal()
            ...     except StandardError:

        EXAMPLES:

        A Petersen Graph is not chordal, nor car it be an interval
        graph ::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.is_interval()
            False

        Though we can build intervals from the corresponding random
        generator::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomInterval(20)
            sage: g.is_interval()
            True

        This method can also return, given an interval graph, a
        possible embedding (we can actually compute all of them
        through the PQ-Tree structures)::

            sage: g = Graph(':S__@_@A_@AB_@AC_@ACD_@ACDE_ACDEF_ACDEFG_ACDEGH_ACDEGHI_ACDEGHIJ_ACDEGIJK_ACDEGIJKL_ACDEGIJKLMaCEGIJKNaCEGIJKNaCGIJKNPaCIP')
            sage: d = g.is_interval(certificate = True)
            sage: print d                                    # not tested
            {0: (0, 20), 1: (1, 9), 2: (2, 36), 3: (3, 5), 4: (4, 38), 5: (6, 21), 6: (7, 27), 7: (8, 12), 8: (10, 29), 9: (11, 16), 10: (13, 39), 11: (14, 31), 12: (15, 32), 13: (17, 23), 14: (18, 22), 15: (19, 33), 16: (24, 25), 17: (26, 35), 18: (28, 30), 19: (34, 37)}

        From this embedding, we can clearly build an interval graph
        isomorphic to the previous one::

            sage: g2 = graphs.IntervalGraph(d.values())
            sage: g2.is_isomorphic(g)
            True

        the calling graph are present in the input ``dist``.

        this layout may not be the best, and might even be confusing

        - ``by_weight`` - Whether to use the labels defined over the edges as
           weights. If ``False`` (default), the distance between `u` and `v` is
           the minimum number of edges of a path from `u` to `v`.

        - ``default_weight`` - (defaults to 1) The default weight to assign
           edges that don't have a weight (i.e., a label).

           Implies ``by_weight == True``.

        - ``algorithm`` -- four options :

           * ``"BFS"`` -- the computation is done through a BFS
             centered on each vertex successively. Only implemented
             when ``default_weight = 1`` and ``by_weight = False``.

           * ``"Floyd-Warshall-Cython"`` -- through the Cython implementation of
             the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

           * ``"Floyd-Warshall-Python"`` -- through the Python implementation of
             the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

           * ``"auto"`` -- use the fastest algorithm depending on the input
             (``"BFS"`` if possible, and ``"Floyd-Warshall-Python"`` otherwise)

             This is the default value.

        OUTPUT:

            A tuple ``(dist, pred)``. They are both dicts of dicts. The first
            indicates the length ``dist[u][v]`` of the shortest weighted path
            from `u` to `v`. The second is a compact representation of all the
            paths- it indicates the predecessor ``pred[u][v]`` of `v` in the
            shortest path from `u` to `v`.

        .. NOTE::

            Three different implementations are actually available through this method :

                * BFS (Cython)
                * Floyd-Warshall (Cython)
                * Floyd-Warshall (Python)

            The BFS algorithm is the fastest of the three, then comes the Cython
            implementation of Floyd-Warshall, and last the Python
            implementation. The first two implementations, however, only compute
            distances based on the topological distance (each edge is of weight
            1, or equivalently the length of a path is its number of
            edges). Besides, they do not deal with graphs larger than 65536
            vertices (which already represents 16GB of ram).

        .. NOTE::

           There is a Cython version of this method that is usually
           much faster for large graphs, as most of the time is
           actually spent building the final double
           dictionary. Everything on the subject is to be found in the
           :mod:`~sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs` module.

            sage: G = Graph( { 0: {1: 1}, 1: {2: 1}, 2: {3: 1}, 3: {4: 2}, 4: {0: 2} }, sparse=True )
            sage: G.plot(edge_labels=True).show() # long time
            sage: dist, pred = G.shortest_path_all_pairs(by_weight = True)
            sage: dist
            {0: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2}, 1: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3}, 2: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 3}, 3: {0: 3, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 2}, 4: {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 0}}
            sage: pred
            {0: {0: None, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 0}, 1: {0: 1, 1: None, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 0}, 2: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: None, 3: 2, 4: 3}, 3: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: None, 4: 3}, 4: {0: 4, 1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: None}}
            sage: pred[0]
            {0: None, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 0}

        So for example the shortest weighted path from `0` to `3` is obtained as
        follows. The predecessor of `3` is ``pred[0][3] == 2``, the predecessor
        of `2` is ``pred[0][2] == 1``, and the predecessor of `1` is
        ``pred[0][1] == 0``.

    def average_distance(self):

        Returns the average distance between vertices of the graph.

        Formally, for a graph `G` this value is equal to
        `\frac 1 {n(n-1)} \sum_{u,v\in G} d(u,v)` where `d(u,v)`
        denotes the distance between vertices `u` and `v` and `n`
        is the number of vertices in `G`.

                             distance=None, neighbors=None):
        """
        Returns an iterator over the vertices in a breadth-first ordering.

        INPUT:


        - ``start`` - vertex or list of vertices from which to start
          the traversal

        - ``ignore_direction`` - (default False) only applies to
          directed graphs. If True, searches across edges in either
          direction.

        - ``distance`` - the maximum distance from the ``start`` nodes
          to traverse.  The ``start`` nodes are distance zero from
          themselves.

        - ``neighbors`` - a function giving the neighbors of a vertex.
          The function should take a vertex and return a list of
          vertices.  For a graph, ``neighbors`` is by default the
          :meth:`.neighbors` function of the graph.  For a digraph,
          the ``neighbors`` function defaults to the
          :meth:`.successors` function of the graph.

        .. SEEALSO::

          -- depth-first search for fast compiled graphs.

        - :meth:`depth_first_search` -- depth-first search for generic graphs.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = Graph( { 0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: [0]} )
            sage: list(G.breadth_first_search(0))
            [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]

        By default, the edge direction of a digraph is respected, but this
        can be overridden by the ``ignore_direction`` parameter::

            sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(0))
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(0, ignore_direction=True))
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]

        You can specify a maximum distance in which to search.  A
        distance of zero returns the ``start`` vertices::

            sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(0,distance=0))
            [0]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(0,distance=1))
            [0, 1, 2, 3]

        Multiple starting vertices can be specified in a list::

            sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search([0]))
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search([0,6]))
            [0, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search([0,6],distance=0))

            [6, 3, 7, 0, 5]

        More generally, you can specify a ``neighbors`` function.  For
        example, you can traverse the graph backwards by setting
        ``neighbors`` to be the :meth:`.neighbors_in` function of the graph::

            sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})

            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(5,neighbors=D.neighbors_out, distance=2))
            [5, 7, 0]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(5,neighbors=D.neighbors, distance=2))

        Returns an iterator over the vertices in a depth-first ordering.

        INPUT:


        - ``start`` - vertex or list of vertices from which to start
          the traversal

        - ``ignore_direction`` - (default False) only applies to
          directed graphs. If True, searches across edges in either
          direction.

        - ``distance`` - the maximum distance from the ``start`` nodes
          to traverse.  The ``start`` nodes are distance zero from
          themselves.

        - ``neighbors`` - a function giving the neighbors of a vertex.
          The function should take a vertex and return a list of
          vertices.  For a graph, ``neighbors`` is by default the
          :meth:`.neighbors` function of the graph.  For a digraph,
          the ``neighbors`` function defaults to the
          :meth:`.successors` function of the graph.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = Graph( { 0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: [0]} )
            sage: list(G.depth_first_search(0))
            [0, 4, 3, 2, 1]

        By default, the edge direction of a digraph is respected, but this
        can be overridden by the ``ignore_direction`` parameter::


            sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})

            [0, 7, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4]

        You can specify a maximum distance in which to search.  A
        distance of zero returns the ``start`` vertices::

            sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search(0,distance=0))
            [0]
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search(0,distance=1))
            [0, 3, 2, 1]

        Multiple starting vertices can be specified in a list::

            sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search([0]))
            [0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 5, 1, 4]
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search([0,6]))
            [0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 5, 1, 4]
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search([0,6],distance=0))
            [0, 6]
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search([0,6],distance=1))

            sage: list(D.depth_first_search(6,ignore_direction=True,distance=2))
            [6, 7, 5, 0, 3]

        More generally, you can specify a ``neighbors`` function.  For
        example, you can traverse the graph backwards by setting
        ``neighbors`` to be the :meth:`.neighbors_in` function of the graph::

            sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})

    def lex_BFS(self,reverse=False,tree=False, initial_vertex = None):
        r"""
        Performs a Lex BFS on the graph.

        A Lex BFS ( or Lexicographic Breadth-First Search ) is a Breadth
        First Search used for the recognition of Chordal Graphs. For more
        information, see the
        `Wikipedia article on Lex-BFS
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_breadth-first_search>`_.

        INPUT:

        - ``reverse`` (boolean) -- whether to return the vertices
          in discovery order, or the reverse.

          ``False`` by default.

        - ``tree`` (boolean) -- whether to return the discovery
          directed tree (each vertex being linked to the one that
          saw it for the first time)

          ``False`` by default.

        - ``initial_vertex`` -- the first vertex to consider.

          ``None`` by default.

        ALGORITHM:

        This algorithm maintains for each vertex left in the graph
        a code corresponding to the vertices already removed. The
        vertex of maximal code ( according to the lexicographic
        order ) is then removed, and the codes are updated.

        This algorithm runs in time `O(n^2)` ( where `n` is the
        number of vertices in the graph ), which is not optimal.
        An optimal algorithm would run in time `O(m)` ( where `m`
        is the number of edges in the graph ), and require the use
        of a doubly-linked list which are not available in python
        and can not really be written efficiently. This could be
        done in Cython, though.

        EXAMPLE:

        A Lex BFS is obviously an ordering of the vertices::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: len(g.lex_BFS()) == g.order()
            True

        For a Chordal Graph, a reversed Lex BFS is a Perfect
        Elimination Order ::

            sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(3).lexicographic_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(2))
            sage: g.lex_BFS(reverse=True)
            [(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)]


        And the vertices at the end of the tree of discovery are, for
        chordal graphs, simplicial vertices (their neighborhood is
        a complete graph)::

            sage: g = graphs.ClawGraph().lexicographic_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(2))
            sage: v = g.lex_BFS()[-1]
            sage: peo, tree = g.lex_BFS(initial_vertex = v,  tree=True)
            sage: leaves = [v for v in tree if tree.in_degree(v) ==0]
            sage: all([g.subgraph(g.neighbors(v)).is_clique() for v in leaves])

        r"""
        Computes the transitive closure of a graph and returns it. The
        original graph is not modified.

        The transitive closure of a graph G has an edge (x,y) if and only
        if there is a path between x and y in G.

        The transitive closure of any strongly connected component of a
        graph is a complete graph. In particular, the transitive closure of
        a connected undirected graph is a complete graph. The transitive
        closure of a directed acyclic graph is a directed acyclic graph
        representing the full partial order.

        Returns a transitive reduction of a graph. The original graph is

        A transitive reduction H of G has a path from x to y if and only if
        there was a path from x to y in G. Deleting any edge of H destroys
        this property. A transitive reduction is not unique in general. A
        transitive reduction has the same transitive closure as the
        original graph.

        A transitive reduction of a complete graph is a tree. A transitive

    def _color_by_label(self, format='hex', as_function=False, default_color = "black"):
        """
        Coloring of the edges according to their label for plotting

        INPUT:

         - ``format`` -- "rgbtuple", "hex", ``True`` (same as "hex"),
           or a function or dictionary assigning colors to labels
           (default: "hex")
         - ``default_color`` -- a color (as a string) or None (default: "black")
         - ``as_function`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

        OUTPUT: A coloring of the edges of this graph.

        If ``as_function`` is ``True``, then the coloring is returned
        as a function assigning a color to each label. Otherwise (the
        default, for backward compatibility), the coloring is returned
        as a dictionary assigning to each color the list of the edges
        of the graph of that color.

        This is factored out from plot() for use in 3d plots, etc.

        If ``format`` is a function, then it is used directly as
        coloring. Otherwise, for each label a default color is chosen
        along a rainbow (see :func:`sage.plot.colors.rainbow`). If
        ``format`` is a dictionary, then the colors specified there
        override the default choices.

        EXAMPLES:

        We consider the Cayley graph of the symmetric group, whose
        edges are labelled by the numbers 1,2, and 3::

            sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4).cayley_graph()
            sage: set(G.edge_labels())
            set([1, 2, 3])

        We first request the coloring as a function::

            sage: f = G._color_by_label(as_function=True)
            sage: [f(1), f(2), f(3)]
            ['#00ff00', '#ff0000', '#0000ff']
            sage: f = G._color_by_label({1: "blue", 2: "red", 3: "green"}, as_function=True)
            sage: [f(1), f(2), f(3)]
            ['blue', 'red', 'green']
            sage: f = G._color_by_label({1: "red"}, as_function=True)

            sage: [f(1), f(2), f(3)]
            ['red', 'blue', 'blue']

        The default output is a dictionary assigning edges to colors::

            sage: G._color_by_label()
            {'#00ff00': [((1,4,3,2), (1,4,3), 1), ... ((1,2)(3,4), (3,4),     1)],
             '#ff0000': [((1,4,3,2), (1,4,2), 2), ... ((1,2)(3,4), (1,3,4,2), 2)],
             '#0000ff': [((1,4,3,2), (1,3,2), 3), ... ((1,2)(3,4), (1,2),     3)]}

           and install it with ``sage -i dot2tex-2.8.?.spkg``

           they are specified by a function or dictionary mapping
           labels to colors; this option is incompatible with
           ``edge_color`` and ``edge_colors``.

        - ``heights`` - if specified, this is a dictionary from a set
          of floating point heights to a set of vertices

        - ``edge_style`` - keyword arguments passed into the
          edge-drawing routine.  This currently only works for
          directed graphs, since we pass off the undirected graph to
          networkx

        - ``tree_root`` - a vertex of the tree to be used as the root
          for the layout="tree" option. If no root is specified, then one
          is chosen at random. Ignored unless layout='tree'.

        - ``tree_orientation`` - "up" or "down" (default is "down").
          If "up" (resp., "down"), then the root of the tree will
          appear on the bottom (resp., top) and the tree will grow
          upwards (resp. downwards). Ignored unless layout='tree'.

        - ``save_pos`` - save position computed during plotting

        .. NOTE::

            - See the documentation of the :mod:`sage.graphs.graph_plot` module
              for information and examples of how to define parameters that will
              be applied to **all** graph plots.

            - Default parameters for this method *and a specific graph* can also
              be set through the :class:`~sage.misc.decorators.options`
              mechanism. For more information on this different way to set
              default parameters, see the help of the :class:`options decorator
              <~sage.misc.decorators.options>`.

           whether to color each edge with a different color according
           to its label; the colors are chosen along a rainbow, unless

        Edge-specific options can also be specified by providing a
        function (or tuple thereof) which maps each edge to a
        dictionary of options. Valid options are "color", "backward"
        (a boolean), "dot" (a string containing a sequence of options
        in dot format), "label" (a string), "label_style" ("string" or
        "latex"), "edge_string" ("--" or "->"). Here we state that the
        graph should be laid out so that edges starting from ``1`` are
        going backward (e.g. going up instead of down)::

            sage: def edge_options((u,v,label)):
            ...       return { "backward": u == 1 }
            sage: print G.graphviz_string(edge_options = edge_options)

        the eigenvalue.

        For some graphs, the exact eigenspaces provided by
        :meth:`eigenspaces` provide additional insight into
        the structure of the eigenspaces.

        EXAMPLES::

            ], 5)]

        Eigenspaces for the Laplacian should be identical since the
        Petersen graph is regular.  However, since the output also
        contains the eigenvalues, the two outputs are slightly
        different. ::

    def relabel(self, perm=None, inplace=True, return_map=False, check_input = True, complete_partial_function = True):
        r"""
        Relabels the vertices of ``self``

        INPUT:

         - ``perm`` -- a function, dictionary, list, permutation, or
           ``None`` (default: ``None``)

         - ``inplace`` -- a boolean (default: ``True``)

         - ``return_map`` -- a boolean (default: ``False``)

         - ``check_input`` (boolean) -- whether to test input for
           correctness. *This can potentially be very time-consuming !*.

         - ``complete_partial_function`` (boolean) -- whether to automatically
           complete the permutation if some elements of the graph are not
           associated with any new name. In this case, those elements are not
           relabeled *This can potentially be very time-consuming !*.

        If ``perm`` is a function ``f``, then each vertex ``v`` is
        relabeled to ``f(v)``.

        If ``perm`` is a dictionary ``d``, then each vertex ``v``
        (which should be a key of ``d``) is relabeled to ``d[v]``.
        Similarly, if ``perm`` is a list or tuple ``l`` of length
        ``n``, then each vertex (which should be in `\{0,1,...,n-1\}`)
        is relabeled to ``l[v]``.

        If ``perm`` is a permutation, then each vertex ``v`` is
        relabeled to ``perm(v)``. Caveat: this assumes that the
        vertices are labelled `\{0,1,...,n-1\}`; since permutations
        act by default on the set `\{1,2,...,n\}`, this is achieved by
        identifying `n` and `0`.

        If ``perm`` is ``None``, the graph is relabeled to be on the
        vertices `\{0,1,...,n-1\}`.

        .. note:: at this point, only injective relabeling are supported.

        If ``inplace`` is ``True``, the graph is modified in place and
        ``None`` is returned. Otherwise a relabeled copy of the graph
        is returned.

        If ``return_map`` is ``True`` a dictionary representing the
        relabelling map is returned (incompatible with ``inplace==False``).

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(3)
            sage: G.am()
            [0 1 0]
            [1 0 1]
            [0 1 0]

        Relabeling using a dictionary. Note that the dictionary does not define
        the new label of vertex `0`::

            sage: G.relabel({1:2,2:1}, inplace=False).am()
            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 1]
            [1 1 0]

        This is because the method automatically "extends" the relabeling to the
        missing vertices (whose label will not change). Checking that all
        vertices have an image can require some time, and this feature can be
        disabled (at your own risk)::

            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 1]

            sage: G.relabel(gamma, inplace=False).am()
            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 1]
            [1 1 0]

        Relabeling using an injective function::

            sage: G.edges()
            [(0, 1, None), (1, 2, None)]
            sage: H = G.relabel(lambda i: i+10, inplace=False)

            sage: H.edges()
            [(10, 11, None), (11, 12, None)]

        Relabeling using a non injective function has no meaning::

            sage: G.edges()
            [(0, 1, None), (1, 2, None)]
            sage: G.relabel(lambda i: 0, inplace=False)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            NotImplementedError: Non injective relabeling

        But this test can be disabled, which leads to ... problems::

            sage: G.edges()
            [(0, 1, None), (1, 2, None)]
            sage: G.relabel(lambda i: 0, check_input = False)
            sage: G.edges()
            [(0, 0, None)]

        Tests whether the current graph is Hamiltonian.

        A graph (resp. digraph) is said to be Hamiltonian
        if it contains as a subgraph a cycle (resp. a circuit)
        going through all the vertices.

        Testing for Hamiltonicity being NP-Complete, this
        algorithm could run for some time depending on
        the instance.

        ALGORITHM:

        See ``Graph.traveling_salesman_problem``.

        OUTPUT:

        Returns ``True`` if a Hamiltonian cycle/circuit exists, and
        ``False`` otherwise.

        NOTE:

        This function, as ``hamiltonian_cycle`` and
        ``traveling_salesman_problem``, computes a Hamiltonian
        cycle if it exists : the user should *NOT* test for
        Hamiltonicity using ``is_hamiltonian`` before calling
        ``hamiltonian_cycle`` or ``traveling_salesman_problem``
        as it would result in computing it twice.

        EXAMPLES:

        Returns the unique graph on `\{0,1,...,n-1\}` ( ``n = self.order()`` ) which

        - is invariant in the isomorphism class.

        In other words, given two graphs ``G`` and ``H`` which are isomorphic,
        suppose ``G_c`` and ``H_c`` are the graphs returned by
        ``canonical_label``. Then the following hold:

        INPUT:

        -  ``partition`` - if given, the canonical label with
           respect to this set partition will be computed. The default is the unit
           set partition.

        -  ``certify`` - if True, a dictionary mapping from the
           (di)graph to its canonical label will be given.

        -  ``verbosity`` - gets passed to nice: prints helpful
           output.

        -  ``edge_labels`` - default False, otherwise allows
           only permutations respecting edge labels.

    """
    Helper function for canonical labeling of edge labeled (di)graphs.

    Translates to a bipartite incidence-structure type graph
    appropriate for computing canonical labels of edge labeled and/or multi-edge graphs.
    Note that this is actually computationally equivalent to
    implementing a change on an inner loop of the main algorithm-
    namely making the refinement procedure sort for each label.

    If the graph is a multigraph, it is translated to a non-multigraph,
    where each edge is labeled with a dictionary describing how many
    edges of each label were originally there. Then in either case we
    are working on a graph without multiple edges. At this point, we
    create another (bipartite) graph, whose left vertices are the
    original vertices of the graph, and whose right vertices represent
    the edges. We partition the left vertices as they were originally,
    and the right vertices by common labels: only automorphisms taking
    edges to like-labeled edges are allowed, and this additional
    partition information enforces this on the bipartite graph.

    INPUT:

    - ``g`` -- Graph or DiGraph
    - ``partition`` -- (default:None) if given, the partition of the vertices is as well relabeled
    - ``standard_label`` -- (default:None) the standard label is not considered to be changed
    - ``return_relabeling`` -- (defaut:False) if True, a dictionary containing the relabeling is returned
    - ``return_edge_labels`` -- (defaut:False) if True, the different edge_labels are returned (useful if inplace is True)
    - ``inplace`` -- (default:False) if True, g is modified, otherwise the result is returned. Note that attributes of g are *not* copied for speed issues, only edges and vertices.

    OUTPUT:

    - if not inplace: the unlabeled graph without multiple edges
    - the partition of the vertices
    - if return_relabeling: a dictionary containing the relabeling
    - if return_edge_labels: the list of (former) edge labels is returned
