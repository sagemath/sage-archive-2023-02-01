The Coercion Model

The coercion model manages how elements of one parent get related to elements
of another. For example, the integer 2 can canonically be viewed as an element
of the rational numbers. (The Parent of a non-element is its Python type.)

::

    sage: ZZ(2).parent()
    Integer Ring
    sage: QQ(2).parent()
    Rational Field

The most prominent role of the coercion model is to make sense of binary
operations between elements that have distinct parents. It does this by
finding a parent where both elements make sense, and doing the operation
there. For example::

    sage: a = 1/2; a.parent()
    Rational Field
    sage: b = ZZ[x].gen(); b.parent()
    Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
    sage: a+b
    x + 1/2
    sage: (a+b).parent()
    Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field

If there is a coercion (see below) from one of the parents to the other,
the operation is always performed in the codomain of that coercion. Otherwise
a reasonable attempt to create a new parent with coercion maps from both
original parents is made. The results of these discoveries are cached.
On failure, a TypeError is always raised.

Some arithmetic operations (such as multiplication) can indicate an action
rather than arithmetic in a common parent. For example::

    sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
    sage: P = E(0,0)
    sage: 5*P
    (1/4 : -5/8 : 1)

where there is action of `\ZZ` on the points of `E` given by the additive
group law. Parents can specify how they act on or are acted upon by other
parents.

There are two kinds of ways to get from one parent to another, coercions and
conversions.

Coercions are canonical (possibly modulo a finite number of
deterministic choices) morphisms, and the set of all coercions between
all parents forms a commuting diagram (modulo possibly rounding
issues). `\ZZ \rightarrow \QQ` is an example of a
coercion. These are invoked implicitly by the coercion model.

Conversions try to construct an element out of their input if at all possible.
Examples include sections of coercions, creating an element from a string or
list, etc. and may fail on some inputs of a given type while succeeding on
others (i.e. they may not be defined on the whole domain). Conversions are
always explicitly invoked, and never used by the coercion model to resolve
binary operations.

For more information on how to specify coercions, conversions, and actions,
see the documentation for Parent.

        Give two parents `R` and `S`, return a pair of coercion maps
        `f: R \rightarrow Z` and `g: S \rightarrow Z` , if such a `Z`
        can be found.

        In the (common) case that `R=Z` or `S=Z` then ``None`` is returned
        for `f` or `g` respectively rather than constructing (and subsequently
        calling) the identity morphism.

        If no suitable `f, g` can be found, a single ``None`` is returned.
        This result is cached.

        .. NOTE::

            By :trac:`14711`, coerce maps should be copied when using them
            outside of the coercion system, because they may become defunct
            by garbage collection.

        - ``S`` - the right Parent (or type)
        - ``op`` - the operand, typically an element of the operator module
        - ``r`` - (optional) element of R
        - ``s`` - (optional) element of S.

        OUTPUT:

        - An action A such that s op r is given by A(s,r).

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: P.get_action(ZZ)
            Right scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring

            True
            sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()

        If R or S is a Parent, ask it for an action by/on R::

            sage: cm.discover_action(ZZ, P, operator.mul)
            Left scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring

        If R or S a type, recursively call get_action with the Sage versions of R and/or S::

            sage: cm.discover_action(P, int, operator.mul)
            Right scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
            with precomposition on right by Native morphism:
              From: Set of Python objects of type 'int'
              To:   Integer Ring

            sage: cm.discover_action(P, ZZ, operator.imul)
            Right scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring

        If op is division, look for action on right by inverse::

            sage: cm.discover_action(P, ZZ, operator.div)
            Right inverse action by Rational Field on Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
