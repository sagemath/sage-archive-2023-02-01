Definition
-----------

Given a graph `G`, the *line graph* `L(G)` of `G` is the graph such that

.. MATH::

    V(L(G)) =& E(G)\\
    E(L(G)) =& \{(e,e'):\text{ and }e,e'\text{ have a common endpoint in }G\}\\

The definition is extended to directed graphs. In this situation, there is an
arc `(e,e')` in `L(G)` if the destination of `e` is the origin of `e'`.

For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Wikipedia page on line graphs
<Line_graph>`.

Root graph
----------

A graph whose line graph is `LG` is called the *root graph* of `LG`. The root
graph of a (connected) graph is unique ([Whitney32]_, [Harary69]_), except when
`LG=K_3`, as both `L(K_3)` and `L(K_{1,3})` are equal to `K_3`.

Here is how we can *"see"* `G` by staring (very intently) at `LG` :

  A graph `LG` is the line graph of `G` if there exists a collection
  `(S_v)_{v\in G}` of subsets of `V(LG)` such that :

  * Every `S_v` is a complete subgraph of `LG`.

  * Every `v\in LG` belongs to exactly two sets of the family `(S_v)_{v\in G}`.

  * Any two sets of `(S_v)_{v\in G}` have at most one common elements

  * For any edge `(u,v)\in LG` there exists a set of `(S_v)_{v\in G}` containing
    both `u` and `v`.

  In this family, each set `S_v` represent a vertex of `G`, and contains "the
  set of edges incident to `v` in `G`". Two elements `S_v,S_{v'}` have a
  nonempty intersection whenever `vv'` is an edge of `G`.

  Hence, finding the root graph of `LG` is the job of finding this collection of
  sets.

In particular, what we know for sure is that a maximal clique `S` of size `2` or
`\geq 4` in `LG` corresponds to a vertex of degree `|S|` in `G`, whose incident
edges are the elements of `S` itself.

The main problem lies with maximal cliques of size 3, i.e. triangles. Those we
have to split into two categories, *even* and *odd* triangles :

  A triangle `\{e_1,e_2,e_3\}\subseteq V(LG)` is said to be an *odd* triangle if
  there exists a vertex `e\in V(G)` incident to exactly *one* or *all* of
  `\{e_1,e_2,e_3\}`, and it is said to be *even* otherwise.

The very good point of this definition is that an inclusionwise maximal clique
which is an odd triangle will always correspond to a vertex of degree 3 in `G`,
while an even triangle could result from either a vertex of degree 3 in `G` or a
triangle in `G`. And in order to build the root graph we obviously have to
decide *which*.

Beineke proves in [Beineke70]_ that the collection of sets we are looking for
can be easily found. Indeed it turns out that it is the union of :

#. The family of all maximal cliques of `LG` of size 2 or `\geq 4`, as well as
   all odd triangles.

#. The family of all pairs of adjacent vertices which appear in exactly *one*
   maximal clique which is an even triangle.

There are actually four special cases to which the decomposition above does not
apply, i.e. graphs containing an edge which belongs to exactly two even
triangles. We deal with those independently.

* The :meth:`Complete graph
  <sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.CompleteGraph>` `K_3`.

* The :meth:`Diamond graph
  <sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.DiamondGraph>` -- the line graph
  of `K_{1,3}` plus an edge.

* The :meth:`Wheel graph
  <sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.WheelGraph>` on `4+1` vertices
  -- the line graph of the :meth:`Diamond graph
  <sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.DiamondGraph>`

* The :meth:`Octahedron
  <sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.OctahedralGraph>` -- the line
  graph of `K_4`.

This decomposition turns out to be very easy to implement :-)

.. WARNING::

    Even though the root graph is *NOT UNIQUE* for the triangle, this method
    returns `K_{1,3}` (and not `K_3`) in this case. Pay *very close* attention
    to that, for this answer is not theoretically correct : there is no unique
    answer in this case, and we deal with it by returning one of the two
    possible answers.

"""

def is_line_graph(g, certificate = False):
    r"""
    Tests wether the graph is a line graph.

    INPUT:

    - ``certificate`` (boolean) -- whether to return a certificate along with
      the boolean result. Here is what happens when ``certificate = True``:

      - If the graph is not a line graph, the method returns a pair ``(b,
        subgraph)`` where ``b`` is ``False`` and ``subgraph`` is a subgraph
        isomorphic to one of the 9 forbidden induced subgraphs of a line graph.

      - If the graph is a line graph, the method returns a triple ``(b,R,isom)``
        where ``b`` is ``True``, ``R`` is a graph whose line graph is the graph
        given as input, and ``isom`` is a map associating an edge of ``R`` to
        each vertex of the graph.

    .. TODO::

        This method sequentially tests each of the forbidden subgraphs in order
        to know whether the graph is a line graph, which is a very slow
        method. It could eventually be replaced by
        :func:`~sage.graphs.line_graph.root_graph` when this method will not
        require an exponential time to run on general graphs anymore (see its
        documentation for more information on this problem)...  and if it can be
        improved to return negative certificates !

    .. NOTE::

        This method wastes a bit of time when the input graph is not
        connected. If you have performance in mind, it is probably better to
        only feed it with connected graphs only.

    The line graph of an undirected graph G is an undirected graph H such that
