== Description ==

GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.
There is no practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the available memory in the machine GMP runs on.
GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular interface.
