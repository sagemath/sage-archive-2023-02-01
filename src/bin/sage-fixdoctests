Given the output of doctest and a file, adjust the doctests so they won't fail.

Doctest failures due to exceptions are ignored.

AUTHORS::

- Nicolas M. Thiery <nthiery at users dot sf dot net>  Initial version (2008?)

- Andrew Mathas <andrew dot mathas at sydney dot edu dot au> 2013-02-14
  Cleaned up the code and hacked it so that the script can now cope with the
  situations when either the expected output or computed output are empty.
  Added doctest to sage.tests.cmdline
