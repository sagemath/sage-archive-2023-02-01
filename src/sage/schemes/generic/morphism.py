Scheme morphism

.. NOTE::

    You should never create the morphisms directy. Instead, use the
    :meth:`~sage.schemes.generic.scheme.hom` and
    :meth:`~sage.structure.parent.Hom` methods that are inherited by
    all schemes.

If you want to extend the Sage library with some new kind of scheme,
your new class (say, ``myscheme``) should provide a method

* ``myscheme._morphism(*args, **kwds)`` returning a morphism
  between two schemes in your category, usually defined via
  polynomials. Your morphism class should derive from
  :class:`SchemeMorphism_polynomial`. These morphisms will usually be
  elements of the Hom-set
  :class:`~sage.schemes.generic.homset.SchemeHomset_generic`.

Optionally, you can also provide a special Hom-set class for your
subcategory of schemes. If you want to do this, you should also
provide a method

* ``myscheme._homset(*args, **kwds)`` returning a
  Hom-set, which must be an element of a derived class of
  `class:`~sage.schemes.generic.homset.SchemeHomset_generic`. If your
  new Hom-set class does not use ``myscheme._morphism`` then you
  do not have to provide it.

Note that points on schemes are morphisms `Spec(K)\to X`, too. But we
typically use a different notation, so they are implemented in a
different derived class. For this, you should implement a method

* ``myscheme._point(*args, **kwds)`` returning a point, that is,
  a morphism `Spec(K)\to X`. Your point class should derive from
  :class:`SchemeMorphism_point`.

Optionally, you can also provide a special Hom-set for the points, for
example the point Hom-set can provide a method to enumerate all
points. If you want to do this, you should also provide a method

* ``myscheme._point_homset(*args, **kwds)`` returning
  the :mod:`~sage.schemes.generic.homset` of points. The Hom-sets of
  points are implemented in classes named ``SchemeHomset_points_...``.
  If your new Hom-set class does not use ``myscheme._point`` then
  you do not have to provide it.

    .. TODO::

        Currently, :class:`SchemeMorphism` copies code from
        :class:`~sage.categories.map.Map` rather than inheriting from it. This
        is to work around a bug in Cython: We want to create a common
        sub-class of :class:`~sage.structure.element.ModuleElement` and
        :class:`SchemeMorphism`, but Cython would currently confuse cpdef
        attributes of the two base classes. Proper inheritance should be used
        as soon as this bug is fixed.
