Shard intersection order

This file builds a combinatorial version of the shard intersection
order of type A (in the classification of finite Coxeter groups). This
is a lattice on the set of permutations, closely related to
noncrossing partitions and the weak order.

For technical reasons, the elements of the posets are not permutations,
but can be easily converted from and to permutations::

    sage: from sage.combinat.shard_order import ShardPosetElement
    sage: p0 = Permutation([1,3,4,2])
    sage: e0 = ShardPosetElement(p0); e0
    (1, 3, 4, 2)
    sage: Permutation(list(e0)) == p0
    True

    An element of the shard poset.

    This is basically a permutation with extra stored arguments:

    - ``p`` -- the permutation itself as a tuple
    - ``runs`` -- the decreasing runs as a tuple of tuples
    - ``run_indices`` -- a list ``integer -> index of the run``
    - ``dpg`` -- the transitive closure of the shard preorder graph
    - ``spg`` -- the transitive reduction of the shard preorder graph

    Return the preorder attached to a tuple of decreasing runs.

    This is a directed graph, whose vertices correspond to the runs.

    in the list of runs and the two intervals defined by the initial and

    Return the shard intersection order on permutations of size `n`.

    This is defined on the set of permutations. To every permutation,
    one can attach a pre-order, using the descending runs and their
    relative positions.

    The shard intersection order is given by the implication (or refinement)
    order on the set of pre-orders defined from all permutations.

    This can also be seen in a geometrical way. Every pre-order defines
    a cone in a vector space of dimension `n`. The shard poset is given by
    the inclusion of these cones.
