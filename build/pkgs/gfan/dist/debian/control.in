Description: A package for computing with Groebner fans
 Gfan is a software package for computing Groebner fans and tropical
 varieties. These are polyhedral fans associated to polynomial ideals.
 The maximal cones of a Groebner fan are in bijection with the marked
 reduced Groebner bases of its defining ideal. The software computes
 all marked reduced Groebner bases of an ideal. Their union is a
 universal Groebner basis. The tropical variety of a polynomial ideal
 is a certain subcomplex of the Groebner fan.  Gfan contains algorithms
 for computing this complex for general ideals and specialized
 algorithms for tropical curves, tropical hypersurfaces and tropical
 varieties of prime ideals. In addition to the above core functions the
 package contains many tools which are useful in the study of Groebner
 bases, initial ideals and tropical geometry. Among these are an
 interactive traversal program for Groebner fans and programs for
 graphical renderings.  For ordinary Groebner basis computations Gfan
 is not competitive in speed compared to programs such as CoCoA,
 Singular and Macaulay2.
