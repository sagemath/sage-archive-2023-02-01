# The methods for testing zn_poly are more complex than those of most other
# packages.  A 'make check' does some quick tests.  These are run from
# 'spkg-install' to check zn_poly is not obviously disfunctional.
#
# However, a more comprehensive set of tests can be run by first building a
# test program, then running that test program, which we do here.
#
# To quote from the file src/README:
#
# make check
#    Runs some quick tests to make sure that everything appears to be working.
#
# make test
#    Builds a test program. Running "test/test all" runs the whole zn_poly test
#    suite, which tests zn_poly much more thoroughly than "make check".
