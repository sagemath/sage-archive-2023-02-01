Examples of simplicial complexes

There are two main types: manifolds and examples related to graph
theory.

For manifolds, there are functions defining the `n`-sphere for any
`n`, the torus, `n`-dimensional real projective space for any `n`, the
complex projective plane, surfaces of arbitrary genus, and some other
manifolds, all as simplicial complexes.

Aside from surfaces, this file also provides functions for
constructing some other simplicial complexes: the simplicial complex
of not-`i`-connected graphs on `n` vertices, the matching complex on n
vertices, the chessboard complex for an `n` by `i` chessboard, and
others.  These provide examples of large simplicial complexes; for
example, ``simplicial_complexes.NotIConnectedGraphs(7,2)`` has over a
million simplices.

All of these examples are accessible by typing
``simplicial_complexes.NAME``, where ``NAME`` is the name of the example.

    .. WARNING::

        This is expected to be a triangulation of the projective plane
        `HP^2` over the ring of quaternions, but this has not been
        proved yet.

    This simplicial complex has the same homology as `HP^2`. Its
    automorphism group is isomorphic to the alternating group `A_5`
    and acts transitively on vertices.

    This is defined here using the description in [BrK92]_. This
    article deals with three different triangulations. This procedure
    returns the only one which has a transitive group of
    automorphisms.

def RealProjectiveSpace(n):
    r"""
    A triangulation of `\Bold{R}P^n` for any `n \geq 0`.

    INPUT:

    - ``n`` -- integer, the dimension of the real projective space
      to construct

    The first few cases are pretty trivial:

    - `\Bold{R}P^0` is a point.

    - `\Bold{R}P^1` is a circle, triangulated as the boundary of a
      single 2-simplex.

    - `\Bold{R}P^2` is the real projective plane, here given its
      minimal triangulation with 6 vertices, 15 edges, and 10
      triangles.

    - `\Bold{R}P^3`: any triangulation has at least 11 vertices by
      a result of Walkup [Wa1970]_; this function returns a
      triangulation with 11 vertices, as given by Lutz [Lu2005]_.

    - `\Bold{R}P^4`: any triangulation has at least 16 vertices by
      a result of Walkup; this function returns a triangulation
      with 16 vertices as given by Lutz; see also Datta [Da2007]_,
      Example 3.12.

    - `\Bold{R}P^n`: Lutz has found a triangulation of
      `\Bold{R}P^5` with 24 vertices, but it does not seem to have
      been published.  Kühnel [Ku1987]_ has described a triangulation of
      `\Bold{R}P^n`, in general, with `2^{n+1}-1` vertices; see
      also Datta, Example 3.21.  This triangulation is presumably
      not minimal, but it seems to be the best in the published
      literature as of this writing.  So this function returns it
      when `n > 4`.

    ALGORITHM: For `n < 4`, these are constructed explicitly by
    listing the facets.  For `n = 4`, this is constructed by
    specifying 16 vertices, two facets, and a certain subgroup `G`
    of the symmetric group `S_{16}`.  Then the set of all facets
    is the `G`-orbit of the two given facets.  This is implemented
    here by explicitly listing all of the facets; the facets
    can be computed by the function :func:`~sage.homology.simplicial_complex.facets_for_RP4`, but
    running the function takes a few seconds.

    For `n > 4`, the construction is as follows: let `S` denote
    the simplicial complex structure on the `n`-sphere given by
    the first barycentric subdivision of the boundary of an
    `(n+1)`-simplex.  This has a simplicial antipodal action: if
    `V` denotes the vertices in the boundary of the simplex, then
    the vertices in its barycentric subdivision `S` correspond to
    nonempty proper subsets `U` of `V`, and the antipodal action
    sends any subset `U` to its complement.  One can show that
    modding out by this action results in a triangulation for
    `\Bold{R}P^n`.  To find the facets in this triangulation, find
    the facets in `S`.  These are indentified in pairs to form
    `\Bold{R}P^n`, so choose a representative from each pair: for
    each facet in `S`, replace any vertex in `S` containing 0 with
    its complement.

    Of course these complexes increase in size pretty quickly as
    `n` increases.

    Returns a minimal triangulation of the K3 surface.

    This is a pure simplicial complex of dimension 4 with 16 vertices
    and 288 facets. It was constructed by Casella and Kühnel
    in [CK2001]_. The construction here uses the labeling from
    Spreer and Kühnel [SK2011]_.

    This simplicial complex is implemented just by listing all 288
    facets. The list of facets can be computed by the function
    :func:`~sage.homology.simplicial_complex.facets_for_K3`, but running the function takes a few
    seconds.

    The simplicial complex of all graphs on `n` vertices which are

    Fix an integer `n>0` and consider the set of graphs on `n`
    vertices.  View each graph as its set of edges, so it is a
    subset of a set of size `n` choose 2.  A graph is
    `i`-connected if, for any `j<i`, if any `j` vertices are
    removed along with the edges emanating from them, then the
    graph remains connected.  Now fix `i`: it is clear that if `G`
    is not `i`-connected, then the same is true for any graph
    obtained from `G` by deleting edges. Thus the set of all
    graphs which are not `i`-connected, viewed as a set of subsets

    if `n` is prime, then `X_A` is rationally acyclic, and if in
    addition `A` forms an arithmetic progression in `\ZZ/(n)`,
    then `X_A` is `\ZZ`-acyclic. Throughout their paper, they
    assume that `n` and `k` are relatively prime, but the
    construction makes sense in general.

    In addition to the results from the cited paper, these
    complexes can have large torsion, given the number of

def RandomTwoSphere(n):
    r"""
    Return a random triangulation of the 2-dimensional sphere with `n`
    vertices.

    INPUT:

    `n` -- an integer

    OUTPUT:

    A random triangulation of the sphere chosen uniformly among
    the *rooted* triangulations on `n` vertices. Because some
    triangulations have nontrivial automorphism groups, this may
    not be equal to the uniform distribution among unrooted
    triangulations.

    ALGORITHM:

    The algorithm is taken from [PS2006]_, section 2.1.

    Starting from a planar tree (represented by its contour as a
    sequence of vertices), one first performs local closures, until no
    one is possible. A local closure amounts to replace in the cyclic
    contour word a sequence ``in1,in2,in3,lf,in3`` by
    ``in1,in3``. After all local closures are done, one has reached
    the partial closure, as in [PS2006]_, figure 5 (a).

    Then one has to perform complete closure by adding two more
    vertices, in order to reach the situation of [PS2006]_, figure 5
    (b). For this, it is necessary to find inside the final contour
    one of the two subsequences ``lf,in,lf``.

    At every step of the algorithm, newly created triangles are added
    in a simplicial complex.

    This algorithm is implemented in
    :meth:`~sage.graphs.generators.random.RandomTriangulation`, which
    creates an embedded graph. The triangles of the simplicial
    complex are recovered from this embedded graph.

        Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b')
        and 8 facets
        sage: G.homology()
        {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: Z}
        sage: G.is_pure()
        True
        sage: fg = G.flip_graph(); fg
        Graph on 8 vertices
        sage: fg.is_planar() and fg.is_regular(3)
        True
