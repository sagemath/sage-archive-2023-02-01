== Description ==

This is a stripped-down version of GAP.  The databases, which are arch
independent, are in a separate package and doc and tests are removed.

== SPKG Maintainers ==

 * William Stein
 * Michael Abshoff
 * Robert Miller
 * David Joyner

== Upstream Contact ==

David Joyner, wdjoyner@gmail.com (on the GAP team, but
Steve Linton, sal@dcs.st-and.ac.uk, is basically the lead developer)

== Dependencies ==

GAP does not depend on any spkg's to build.

== Change log ==

=== gap-4.4.10.p12 (William Stein, June 2, 2009) ===
 * Turn optimization back off for itanium, using exactly the same code as from before to do this.

=== gap-4.4.10.p11 (Michael Abshoff, September 20th, 2008) ===
 * Delete all old GAP installs due to a downgrade from GAP 4.4.12 (#5697)

=== gap-4.4.10.p10 (Michael Abshoff, September 20th, 2008) ===
 * unset CXX in spkg-install (work around for #4161)

=== gap-4.4.10.p9 (William Stein, August 27th, 2008) ===
 * Apply all the itanium patches to the src/ directory.
   These are from http://www.gap-system.org/Faq/Hardware-OS/hardware-os8.html
   and will be in *all* future versions of Gap (i.e., they come
   from upstream).  They change about 10 files, so I didn't not
   use our usual patches/* and copy protocol.

=== gap-4.4.10.p8 (Michael Abshoff, June 16th, 2008) ===
 * unset CC in spkg-install (work around for #2575)

=== gap-4.4.10.p6 (David Joyner, April 11th, 2008) ===
 * replace guava 3.4 by guava 3.4 with fixed Makefile.in

=== gap-4.4.10.p5 (Michael Abshoff, April 1st, 2008) ===
 * Debianize GAP spkg (Tim Abbott, #2756)

=== gap-4.4.10.p4 (Robert Miller, March 31st, 2008) ===
 * Leon's code is now fully compiled and copied over to $SAGE_LOCAL

=== gap-4.4.10.p3 (David Joyner, March 30th, 2008) ===
 * replace guava 3.1 by guava 3.3

=== gap-4.4.10.p2 (Michael Abshoff, Jan. 31st, 2008) ===
 * remove src/pkg/guava3.1/src/leonconv (#2006)

=== gap-4.4.10.p1 (Michael Abshoff, Jan. 22nd, 2008) ===
 * remove 1500 crap files from the spkg (part of #1883)

=== gap-4.4.10.p0 ===

Upgraded to gap-4.4.10.  Had to change files in the patches directory that
hard code gap-4.4.9.
