Common Graphs

All graphs in Sage can be built through the ``graphs`` object. In order to
build a complete graph on 15 elements, one can do::

    sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(15)

To get a path with 4 vertices, and the house graph::

    sage: p = graphs.PathGraph(4)
    sage: h = graphs.HouseGraph()

More interestingly, one can get the list of all graphs that Sage knows how to
build by typing ``graphs.`` in Sage and then hitting tab.

# This method appends a list of methods to the doc as a 3xN table.

class GraphGenerators():
    r"""
    A class consisting of constructors for several common graphs, as well as
    orderly generation of isomorphism class representatives. See the
    :mod:`module's help <sage.graphs.graph_generators>` for a list of supported
    constructors.

    A list of all graphs and graph structures (other than isomorphism class
    representatives) in this database is available via tab completion. Type
    "graphs." and then hit the tab key to see which graphs are available.

    The docstrings include educational information about each named
    graph with the hopes that this class can be used as a reference.

    For all the constructors in this class (except the octahedral,
    dodecahedral, random and empty graphs), the position dictionary is
    filled to override the spring-layout algorithm.


    ORDERLY GENERATION::

        graphs(vertices, property=lambda x: True, augment='edges', size=None)

    This syntax accesses the generator of isomorphism class
    representatives. Iterates over distinct, exhaustive
    representatives.

    Also: see the use of the optional nauty package for generating graphs
    at the :meth:`nauty_geng` method.

    INPUT:

    - ``vertices`` -- natural number.

    - ``property`` -- (default: ``lambda x: True``) any property to be
      tested on graphs before generation, but note that in general the
      graphs produced are not the same as those produced by using the
      property function to filter a list of graphs produced by using
      the ``lambda x: True`` default. The generation process assumes
      the property has certain characteristics set by the ``augment``
      argument, and only in the case of inherited properties such that
      all subgraphs of the relevant kind (for ``augment='edges'`` or
      ``augment='vertices'``) of a graph with the property also
      possess the property will there be no missing graphs.  (The
      ``property`` argument is ignored if ``degree_sequence`` is
      specified.)

    - ``augment`` -- (default: ``'edges'``) possible values:

      - ``'edges'`` -- augments a fixed number of vertices by
        adding one edge. In this case, all graphs on exactly ``n=vertices`` are
        generated. If for any graph G satisfying the property, every
        subgraph, obtained from G by deleting one edge but not the vertices
        incident to that edge, satisfies the property, then this will
        generate all graphs with that property. If this does not hold, then
        all the graphs generated will satisfy the property, but there will
        be some missing.

      - ``'vertices'`` -- augments by adding a vertex and
        edges incident to that vertex. In this case, all graphs up to
        ``n=vertices`` are generated. If for any graph G satisfying the
        property, every subgraph, obtained from G by deleting one vertex
        and only edges incident to that vertex, satisfies the property,
        then this will generate all graphs with that property. If this does
        not hold, then all the graphs generated will satisfy the property,
        but there will be some missing.

    - ``size`` -- (default: ``None``) the size of the graph to be generated.

    - ``degree_sequence`` -- (default: ``None``) a sequence of non-negative integers,
      or ``None``. If specified, the generated graphs will have these
      integers for degrees. In this case, property and size are both
      ignored.

    - ``loops`` -- (default: ``False``) whether to allow loops in the graph
      or not.

    - ``implementation`` -- (default: ``'c_graph'``) which underlying
      implementation to use (see ``Graph?``).

    - ``sparse`` -- (default: ``True``) ignored if implementation is not
      ``'c_graph'``.

    - ``copy`` (boolean) -- If set to ``True`` (default)
      this method makes copies of the graphs before returning
      them. If set to ``False`` the method returns the graph it
      is working on. The second alternative is faster, but modifying
      any of the graph instances returned by the method may break
      the function's behaviour, as it is using these graphs to
      compute the next ones : only use ``copy_graph = False`` when
      you stick to *reading* the graphs returned.

    EXAMPLES:

    Print graphs on 3 or less vertices::

        sage: for G in graphs(3, augment='vertices'):
        ...    print G
        Graph on 0 vertices
        Graph on 1 vertex
        Graph on 2 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 2 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices

    Note that we can also get graphs with underlying Cython implementation::

        sage: for G in graphs(3, augment='vertices', implementation='c_graph'):
        ...    print G
        Graph on 0 vertices
        Graph on 1 vertex
        Graph on 2 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 2 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices

    Print graphs on 3 vertices.

    ::

        sage: for G in graphs(3):
        ...    print G
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices
        Graph on 3 vertices

    Generate all graphs with 5 vertices and 4 edges.

    ::

        sage: L = graphs(5, size=4)
        sage: len(list(L))
        6

    Generate all graphs with 5 vertices and up to 4 edges.

    ::

        sage: L = list(graphs(5, lambda G: G.size() <= 4))
        sage: len(L)
        14
        sage: graphs_list.show_graphs(L) # long time

    Generate all graphs with up to 5 vertices and up to 4 edges.

    ::

        sage: L = list(graphs(5, lambda G: G.size() <= 4, augment='vertices'))
        sage: len(L)
        31
        sage: graphs_list.show_graphs(L)              # long time

    Generate all graphs with degree at most 2, up to 6 vertices.

    ::

        sage: property = lambda G: ( max([G.degree(v) for v in G] + [0]) <= 2 )
        sage: L = list(graphs(6, property, augment='vertices'))
        sage: len(L)
        45

    Generate all bipartite graphs on up to 7 vertices: (see
    :oeis:`A033995`)

    ::

        sage: L = list( graphs(7, lambda G: G.is_bipartite(), augment='vertices') )
        sage: [len([g for g in L if g.order() == i]) for i in [1..7]]
        [1, 2, 3, 7, 13, 35, 88]

    Generate all bipartite graphs on exactly 7 vertices::

        sage: L = list( graphs(7, lambda G: G.is_bipartite()) )
        sage: len(L)
        88

    Generate all bipartite graphs on exactly 8 vertices::

        sage: L = list( graphs(8, lambda G: G.is_bipartite()) ) # long time
        sage: len(L)                                            # long time
        303

    Remember that the property argument does not behave as a filter,
    except for appropriately inheritable properties::

        sage: property = lambda G: G.is_vertex_transitive()
        sage: len(list(graphs(4, property)))
        1
        sage: len(filter(property, graphs(4)))
        4
        sage: property = lambda G: G.is_bipartite()
        sage: len(list(graphs(4, property)))
        7
        sage: len(filter(property, graphs(4)))
        7

    Generate graphs on the fly: (see :oeis:`A000088`)

    ::

        sage: for i in range(0, 7):
        ...    print len(list(graphs(i)))
        1
        1
        2
        4
        11
        34
        156

    Generate all simple graphs, allowing loops: (see :oeis:`A000666`)

    ::

        sage: L = list(graphs(5,augment='vertices',loops=True))               # long time
        sage: for i in [0..5]: print i, len([g for g in L if g.order() == i]) # long time
        0 1
        1 2
        2 6
        3 20
        4 90
        5 544

    Generate all graphs with a specified degree sequence (see :oeis:`A002851`)::

        sage: for i in [4,6,8]:  # long time (4s on sage.math, 2012)
        ...       print i, len([g for g in graphs(i, degree_sequence=[3]*i) if g.is_connected()])
        4 1
        6 2
        8 5
        sage: for i in [4,6,8]:  # long time (7s on sage.math, 2012)
        ...       print i, len([g for g in graphs(i, augment='vertices', degree_sequence=[3]*i) if g.is_connected()])
        4 1
        6 2
        8 5

    ::

        sage: print 10, len([g for g in graphs(10,degree_sequence=[3]*10) if g.is_connected()]) # not tested
        10 19

    Make sure that the graphs are really independent and the generator
    survives repeated vertex removal (:trac:`8458`)::

        sage: for G in graphs(3):
        ...       G.delete_vertex(0)
        ...       print(G.order())
        2
        2
        2
        2

    def nauty_geng(self, options="", debug=False):
        r"""
        Returns a generator which creates graphs from nauty's geng program.

        .. note::

            Due to license restrictions, the nauty package is distributed
            as a Sage optional package.  At a system command line, execute
            ``sage -i nauty`` to see the nauty license and install the
            package.

        INPUT:

        - ``options`` - a string passed to  geng  as if it was run at
          a system command line. At a minimum, you *must* pass the
          number of vertices you desire.  Sage expects the graphs to be
          in nauty's "graph6" format, do not set an option to change
          this default or results will be unpredictable.

        - ``debug`` - default: ``False`` - if ``True`` the first line of
          geng's output to standard error is captured and the first call
          to the generator's ``next()`` function will return this line
          as a string.  A line leading with ">A" indicates a successful
          initiation of the program with some information on the arguments,
          while a line beginning with ">E" indicates an error with the input.

        The possible options, obtained as output of ``geng --help``::

                 n    : the number of vertices
            mine:maxe : a range for the number of edges
                        #:0 means '# or more' except in the case 0:0
              res/mod : only generate subset res out of subsets 0..mod-1

                -c    : only write connected graphs
                -C    : only write biconnected graphs
                -t    : only generate triangle-free graphs
                -f    : only generate 4-cycle-free graphs
                -b    : only generate bipartite graphs
                            (-t, -f and -b can be used in any combination)
                -m    : save memory at the expense of time (only makes a
                            difference in the absence of -b, -t, -f and n <= 28).
                -d#   : a lower bound for the minimum degree
                -D#   : a upper bound for the maximum degree
                -v    : display counts by number of edges
                -l    : canonically label output graphs

                -q    : suppress auxiliary output (except from -v)

        Options which cause geng to use an output format different
        than the graph6 format are not listed above (-u, -g, -s, -y, -h)
        as they will confuse the creation of a Sage graph.  The res/mod
        option can be useful when using the output in a routine run
        several times in parallel.

        OUTPUT:

        A generator which will produce the graphs as Sage graphs.
        These will be simple graphs: no loops, no multiple edges, no
        directed edges.

        .. SEEALSO::

            :meth:`Graph.is_strongly_regular` -- tests whether a graph is
            strongly regular and/or returns its parameters.

        EXAMPLES:

        The generator can be used to construct graphs for testing,
        one at a time (usually inside a loop).  Or it can be used to
        create an entire list all at once if there is sufficient memory
        to contain it.  ::

            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            StopIteration: Exhausted list of graphs from nauty geng

        A list of just the connected graphs on 7 vertices.  This agrees with

            sage: len(list(gen))  # optional nauty
            853

        The ``debug`` switch can be used to examine geng's reaction
        to the input in the ``options`` string.  We illustrate success.
        (A failure will be a string beginning with ">E".)  Passing the
        "-q" switch to geng will supress the indicator of a
        successful initiation.  ::

    def cospectral_graphs(self, vertices, matrix_function=lambda g: g.adjacency_matrix(), graphs=None):
        r"""
        Find all sets of graphs on ``vertices`` vertices (with
        possible restrictions) which are cospectral with respect to a
        constructed matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` - The number of vertices in the graphs to be tested

        - ``matrix_function`` - A function taking a graph and giving back
          a matrix.  This defaults to the adjacency matrix.  The spectra
          examined are the spectra of these matrices.

        - ``graphs`` - One of three things:

           - ``None`` (default) - test all graphs having ``vertices``
             vertices

           - a function taking a graph and returning ``True`` or ``False``
             - test only the graphs on ``vertices`` vertices for which
             the function returns ``True``

           - a list of graphs (or other iterable object) - these graphs
             are tested for cospectral sets.  In this case,
             ``vertices`` is ignored.

        OUTPUT:

           A list of lists of graphs.  Each sublist will be a list of
           cospectral graphs (lists of cadinality 1 being omitted).

            sage: g[0][1].am().charpoly()==g[0][1].am().charpoly()

        There are two sets of cospectral graphs (with respect to the
        Laplacian matrix) on six vertices::

        To find cospectral graphs with respect to the normalized
        Laplacian, assuming the graphs do not have an isolated vertex, it
        is enough to check the spectrum of the matrix `D^{-1}A`, where `D`
        is the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees, and A is the adjacency
        matrix.  We find two such cospectral graphs (for the normalized
        Laplacian) on five vertices::

        A file with planar code starts with a header ``>>planar_code<<``.
        After the header each graph is stored in the following way :

        The first character is the number of vertices, followed by

        where the n1* are all neighbors of n1 and all n2* are the

        Besides, these neighbors are enumerated in clockwise order.

        the buckygen generator (see [buckygen]_).

        INPUT:

        - ``order`` - a positive even integer smaller than or equal to 254.
          This specifies the number of vertices in the generated fullerenes.

        - ``ipr`` - default: ``False`` - if ``True`` only fullerenes that
          satisfy the Isolated Pentagon Rule are generated. This means that
          no pentagonal faces share an edge.

        OUTPUT:

        A generator which will produce the fullerene graphs as Sage graphs
        with an embedding set. These will be simple graphs: no loops, no
        multiple edges, no directed edges.

        r"""
        An iterator over planar quadrangulations using the plantri generator.

        This uses the plantri generator (see [plantri]_) which is available
        through the optional package plantri.

        INPUT:

        - ``order`` - a positive integer smaller than or equal to 64.
          This specifies the number of vertices in the generated quadrangulations.

        - ``minimum_degree`` - default: ``None`` - a value `\geq 2` and `\leq
          3`, or ``None``. This specifies the minimum degree of the generated
          quadrangulations. If this is ``None`` and the minimum connectivity is
          specified, then this is set to the same value as the minimum
          connectivity. If the minimum connectivity is also equal to ``None``,
          then this is set to 2.

        - ``minimum_connectivity`` - default: ``None`` - a value `\geq 2` and
          `\leq 3`, or ``None``. This specifies the minimum connectivity of the
          generated quadrangulations. If this is ``None`` and the option
          ``no_nonfacial_quadrangles`` is set to ``True``, then this is set to
          3. Otherwise if this is ``None`` and the minimum degree is specified,
          then this is set to the minimum degree. If the minimum degree is also
          equal to ``None``, then this is set to 3.

        - ``no_nonfacial_quadrangles`` - default: ``False`` - if ``True`` only
          quadrangulations with no non-facial quadrangles are generated. This
          option cannot be used if ``minimum_connectivity`` is set to 2.

        - ``dual`` - default: ``False`` - if ``True`` return instead the
          planar duals of the generated graphs.

        OUTPUT:

        An iterator which will produce all planar quadrangulations with the given
        number of vertices as Sage graphs with an embedding set. These will be
        simple graphs (no loops, no multiple edges, no directed edges).
