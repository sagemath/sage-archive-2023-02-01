== Description ==
From the IPython website:

IPython is a multiplatform, Free Software project (BSD licensed) that offers:

 * An enhanced Python shell designed for efficient interactive work. It includes many enhancements over the default Python shell, including the ability for controlling interactively all major GUI toolkits in a non-blocking manner.
 * A library to build customized interactive environments using Python as the basic language (but with the possibility of having extended or alternate syntaxes).
 * A system for interactive distributed and parallel computing (this is part of IPython's new development).
