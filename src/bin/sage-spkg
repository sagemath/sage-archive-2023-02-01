#
#  sage-spkg: install a Sage package
#
#  This script is typically invoked by giving the command
#      sage -i <options> <package name>...
#
#  Options can be:
#   -f: install a package even if the same version is already installed
#   -s: do not delete temporary build directory
#   -c: after installing, run the test suite for the spkg. This should
#       override the settings of SAGE_CHECK and SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES.
#   -d: only download the package
#
#  A package may assume that the following environment
#  variables are defined:
#
#      SAGE_ROOT      -- root directory of sage install
#      SAGE_LOCAL     -- $SAGE_ROOT/local
#      SAGE_DISTFILES -- directory that stores upstream tarballs
#      LIBRARY_PATH, PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
#      CC, CXX, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS, MAKE
#
#  Your package script should try to build using the giving CC, CXX,
#  CFLAGS, MAKE, etc, via a file spkg-install in your script.
#
#  This script does the following:
#
#      1. Set environment variables (by calling sage-env)
#      2. Extract the metadata and upstream sources into a build directory
#      3. Run the script in the package called spkg-install
#      4. Return error 1 if anything goes wrong.

Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and including the relevant part of the log file
  $SAGE_LOGS/$PKG_NAME.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
`pwd` and type '$2' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
  (cd '`pwd`' && '$SAGE_ROOT/sage' --sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the subshell.
