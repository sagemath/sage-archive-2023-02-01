    Returns a random graph on `n` nodes. Each edge is inserted independently
    with probability `p`.

    INPUT:

    - ``n`` -- number of nodes of the graph

    - ``p`` -- probability of an edge

    - ``seed`` -- integer seed for random number generator (default=None).

    - ``fast`` -- boolean set to True (default) to use the algorithm with
      time complexity in `O(n+m)` proposed in [BatBra2005]_. It is designed
      for generating large sparse graphs. It is faster than other algorithms for
      *LARGE* instances (try it to know whether it is useful for you).

    - ``algorithm`` -- By default (```algorithm='Sage'``), this function uses the
      algorithm implemented in ```sage.graphs.graph_generators_pyx.pyx``. When
      ``algorithm='networkx'``, this function calls the NetworkX function
      ``fast_gnp_random_graph``, unless ``fast=False``, then
      ``gnp_random_graph``. Try them to know which algorithm is the best for
      you. The ``fast`` parameter is not taken into account by the 'Sage'
      algorithm so far.

    From the NetworkX documentation: The average clustering has a hard
    time getting above a certain cutoff that depends on m. This cutoff
    is often quite low. Note that the transitivity (fraction of
    triangles to possible triangles) seems to go down with network
    size. It is essentially the Barabasi-Albert growth model with an
    extra step that each random edge is followed by a chance of making
    an edge to one of its neighbors too (and thus a triangle). This
    algorithm improves on B-A in the sense that it enables a higher
    average clustering to be attained if desired. It seems possible to
    have a disconnected graph with this algorithm since the initial m
    nodes may not be all linked to a new node on the first iteration
    like the BA model.

    Returns a random tolerance graph.

    The random tolerance graph is built from a random tolerance representation
    by using the function `ToleranceGraph`. This representation is a list

    `I_i = (l_i,r_i)` denotes a random interval and `t_i` a random positive
    value. The width of the representation is limited to n**2 * 2**n.

    .. NOTE::

        The vertices are named 0, 1, ..., n-1. The tolerance representation used
        to create the graph is saved with the graph and can be recovered using
        ``get_vertex()`` or ``get_vertices()``.

# uniform random triangulation using Schaeffer-Poulalhon algorithm


def _auxiliary_random_word(n):
    r"""
    Return a random word used to generate random triangulations.

    INPUT:

    n -- an integer

    OUTPUT:

    A binary sequence `w` of length `4n-2` with `n-1` ones, such that any proper
    prefix `u` of `w` satisfies `3|u|_1 - |u|_0 > -2` (where `|u|_1` and `|u|_0`
    are respectively the number of 1s and 0s in `u`). Those words are the
    expected input of :func:`_contour_and_graph_from_word`.

    ALGORITHM:

    A random word with these numbers of `0` and `1` is chosen. This
    word is then rotated in order to give an admissible code for a
    tree (as explained in Proposition 4.2, [PS2006]_). There are
    exactly two such rotations, one of which is chosen at random.

    Let us consider a word `w` satisfying the expected conditions. By
    drawing a step (1,3) for each 1 and a step (1,-1) for each 0 in
    `w`, one gets a path starting at height 0, ending at height -2 and
    staying above (or on) the horizontal line of height -1 except at the
    end point. By cutting the word at the first position of height -1,
    let us write `w=uv`. One can then see that `v` can only touch the line
    of height -1 at its initial point and just before its end point
    (these two points may be the same).

    Now consider a word `w'` obtained from `w` by any
    rotation. Because `vu` is another word satisfying the expected
    conditions, one can assume that `w'` is obtained from `w` by
    starting at some point in `u`. The algorithm must then recognize
    the end of `u` and the end of `v` inside `w'`. The end of `v` is
    the unique point of minimal height `h`. The end of `u` is the first
    point reaching the height `h+1`.

def _contour_and_graph_from_word(w):
    r"""
    Return the contour word and the graph of inner vertices of the tree
    associated with the word `w`.

    INPUT:

    - `w` -- a word in `0` and `1` as given by :func:`_auxiliary_random_word`

    This word must satisfy the conditions described in Proposition 4.2 of
    [PS2006]_ (see :func:`_auxiliary_random_word`).

    OUTPUT:

    a pair ``(seq, G)`` where:

    - ``seq`` is a sequence of pairs (label, integer) representing the
      contour walk along the tree associated with `w`

    - ``G`` is the tree obtained by restriction to the set of inner vertices

    The underlying bijection from words to trees is given by lemma 4.1
    in [PS2006]_. It maps the admissible words to planar trees where
    every inner vertex has two leaves.

    In the word `w`, the letter `1` means going away from the root ("up") from
    an inner vertex to another inner vertex. The letter `0` denotes all other
    steps of the discovery, i.e. either discovering a leaf vertex or going
    toward the root ("down"). Thus, the length of `w` is twice the number of
    edges between inner vertices, plus the number of leaves.

    Inner vertices are tagged with 'in' and leaves are tagged with
    'lf'. Inner vertices are moreover labelled by integers, and leaves
    by the label of the neighbor inner vertex.

def RandomTriangulation(n, set_position=False):
    r"""
    Return a random triangulation on `n` vertices.

    A triangulation is a planar graph all of whose faces are
    triangles (3-cycles).

    INPUT:

    - `n` -- an integer

    - ``set_position`` -- boolean (default ``False``) if set to ``True``, this
      will compute coordinates for a planar drawing of the graph.

    OUTPUT:

    A random triangulation chosen uniformly among the *rooted* triangulations on
    `n` vertices. This is a planar graph and comes with a combinatorial
    embedding.

    Because some triangulations have nontrivial automorphism
    groups, this may not be equal to the uniform distribution among unrooted
    triangulations.

    ALGORITHM:

    The algorithm is taken from [PS2006]_, section 2.1.

    Starting from a planar tree (represented by its contour as a
    sequence of vertices), one first performs local closures, until no
    one is possible. A local closure amounts to replace in the cyclic
    contour word a sequence ``in1,in2,in3,lf,in3`` by
    ``in1,in3``. After all local closures are done, one has reached
    the partial closure, as in [PS2006]_, figure 5 (a).

    Then one has to perform complete closure by adding two more
    vertices, in order to reach the situation of [PS2006]_, figure 5
    (b). For this, it is necessary to find inside the final contour
    one of the two subsequences ``lf,in,lf``.

    At every step of the algorithm, newly created edges are recorded
    in a graph, which will be returned at the end.

    The combinatorial embedding is also computed and recorded in the
    output graph.
