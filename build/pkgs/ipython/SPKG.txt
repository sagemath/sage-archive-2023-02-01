== Description ==
From the IPython website:

IPython is a multiplatform, Free Software project (BSD licensed) that offers:

 * An enhanced Python shell designed for efficient interactive
   work. It includes many enhancements over the default Python shell,
   including the ability for controlling interactively all major GUI
   toolkits in a non-blocking manner.
 * A library to build customized interactive environments using Python
   as the basic language (but with the possibility of having extended
   or alternate syntaxes).
* A system for interactive distributed and parallel computing (this is
   part of IPython's new development).

== Patches ==

 * prun_timeit_magics.patch: See https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2403.
   This patch allows Sage to preparse %prun and %timeit commands.  It will
   probably not be needed with IPython 0.14, since the input splitter will need
   to be rewritten.

 * ipython-history-backport.patch: Backport of improvements to
   IPython/core/history.py
