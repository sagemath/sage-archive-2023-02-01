Implements a lazy string for python useful for use with gettext

A module that provides lazy strings for translations. Basically you get an
object that appears to be a string but changes the value every time the value
is evaluated based on a callable you provide.

For example you can have a global lazy_gettext function that returns a lazy
string with the value of the current set language.
