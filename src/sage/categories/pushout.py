class ConstructionFunctor(Functor):
    """
    Base class for construction functors.

    A construction functor is a functorial algebraic construction,
    such as the construction of a matrix ring over a given ring
    or the fraction field of a given ring.

    In addition to the class :class:`~sage.categories.functor.Functor`,
    construction functors provide rules for combining and merging
    constructions. This is an important part of Sage's coercion model,
    namely the pushout of two constructions: When a polynomial ``p`` in
    a variable ``x`` with integer coefficients is added to a rational
    number ``q``, then Sage finds that the parents ``ZZ['x']`` and
    ``QQ`` are obtained from ``ZZ`` by applying a polynomial ring
    construction respectively the fraction field construction. Each
    construction functor has an attribute ``rank``, and the rank of
    the polynomial ring construction is higher than the rank of the
    fraction field construction. This means that the pushout of ``QQ``
    and ``ZZ['x']``, and thus a common parent in which ``p`` and ``q``
    can be added, is ``QQ['x']``, since the construction functor with
    a lower rank is applied first.

    ::

        sage: F1, R = QQ.construction()
        sage: F1
        FractionField
        sage: R
        Integer Ring
        sage: F2, R = (ZZ['x']).construction()
        sage: F2
        Poly[x]
        sage: R
        Integer Ring
        sage: F3 = F2.pushout(F1)
        sage: F3
        Poly[x](FractionField(...))
        sage: F3(R)
        Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
        sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
        sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
        sage: pushout(QQ,P)
        Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
        sage: ((x+1) + 1/2).parent()
        Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field

    When composing two construction functors, they are sometimes
    merged into one, as is the case in the Quotient construction::

        sage: Q15, R = (ZZ.quo(15*ZZ)).construction()
        sage: Q15
        QuotientFunctor
        sage: Q35, R = (ZZ.quo(35*ZZ)).construction()
        sage: Q35
        QuotientFunctor
        sage: Q15.merge(Q35)
        QuotientFunctor
        sage: Q15.merge(Q35)(ZZ)
        Ring of integers modulo 5

    Functors can not only be applied to objects, but also to morphisms in the
    respective categories. For example::

        sage: P.<x,y> = ZZ[]
        sage: F = P.construction()[0]; F
        MPoly[x,y]
        sage: A.<a,b> = GF(5)[]
        sage: f = A.hom([a+b,a-b],A)
        sage: F(A)
        Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Finite Field of size 5
        sage: F(f)
        Ring endomorphism of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Finite Field of size 5
          Defn: Induced from base ring by
                Ring endomorphism of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Finite Field of size 5

                        b |--> a - b

class InfinitePolynomialFunctor(ConstructionFunctor):
    """
    A Construction Functor for Infinite Polynomial Rings (see :mod:`~sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_ring`).

    AUTHOR:

    -- Simon King

    This construction functor is used to provide uniqueness of infinite polynomial rings as parent structures.
    As usual, the construction functor allows for constructing pushouts.

    Another purpose is to avoid name conflicts of variables of the to-be-constructed infinite polynomial ring with
    variables of the base ring, and moreover to keep the internal structure of an Infinite Polynomial Ring as simple
    as possible: If variables `v_1,...,v_n` of the given base ring generate an *ordered* sub-monoid of the monomials
    of the ambient Infinite Polynomial Ring, then they are removed from the base ring and merged with the generators
    of the ambient ring. However, if the orders don't match, an error is raised, since there was a name conflict
    without merging.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: A.<a,b> = InfinitePolynomialRing(ZZ['t'])
        sage: A.construction()
        [InfPoly{[a,b], "lex", "dense"},
         Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring]
        sage: type(_[0])
        <class 'sage.categories.pushout.InfinitePolynomialFunctor'>
        sage: B.<x,y,a_3,a_1> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order='lex')
        sage: B.construction()
        (MPoly[x,y,a_3,a_1], Rational Field)
        sage: A.construction()[0]*B.construction()[0]
        InfPoly{[a,b], "lex", "dense"}(MPoly[x,y](...))

    Apparently the variables `a_1,a_3` of the polynomial ring are merged with the variables
    `a_0, a_1, a_2, ...` of the infinite polynomial ring; indeed, they form an ordered sub-structure.
    However, if the polynomial ring was given a different ordering, merging would not be allowed,
    resulting in a name conflict::

        sage: A.construction()[0]*PolynomialRing(QQ,names=['x','y','a_3','a_1']).construction()[0]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        CoercionException: Incompatible term orders lex, degrevlex

    In an infinite polynomial ring with generator `a_\\ast`, the variable `a_3` will always be greater
    than the variable `a_1`. Hence, the orders are incompatible in the next example as well::

        sage: A.construction()[0]*PolynomialRing(QQ,names=['x','y','a_1','a_3'], order='lex').construction()[0]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        CoercionException: Overlapping variables (('a', 'b'),['a_1', 'a_3']) are incompatible

    Another requirement is that after merging the order of the remaining variables must be unique.
    This is not the case in the following example, since it is not clear whether the variables `x,y`
    should be greater or smaller than the variables `b_\\ast`::

        sage: A.construction()[0]*PolynomialRing(QQ,names=['a_3','a_1','x','y'], order='lex').construction()[0]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        CoercionException: Overlapping variables (('a', 'b'),['a_3', 'a_1']) are incompatible

    Since the construction functors are actually used to construct infinite polynomial rings, the following
    result is no surprise::

        sage: C.<a,b> = InfinitePolynomialRing(B); C
        Infinite polynomial ring in a, b over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field

    There is also an overlap in the next example::

        sage: X.<w,x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(ZZ)
        sage: Y.<x,y,z> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)

    `X` and `Y` have an overlapping generators `x_\\ast, y_\\ast`. Since the default lexicographic order is
    used in both rings, it gives rise to isomorphic sub-monoids in both `X` and `Y`. They are merged in the
    pushout, which also yields a common parent for doing arithmetic::

        sage: P = sage.categories.pushout.pushout(Y,X); P
        Infinite polynomial ring in w, x, y, z over Rational Field
        sage: w[2]+z[3]
        w_2 + z_3
        sage: _.parent() is P
        True

        Algebraic extension with embeddings currently only
        works when applied to the rational field. This is
        why we use the admittedly strange rule above for
        merging.

        EXAMPLES:

        The following demonstrate coercions for finite fields using Conway or
        pseudo-Conway polynomials::

            sage: k = GF(3^2, conway=True, prefix='z'); a = k.gen()
            sage: l = GF(3^3, conway=True, prefix='z'); b = l.gen()
            sage: a + b # indirect doctest
            z6^5 + 2*z6^4 + 2*z6^3 + z6^2 + 2*z6 + 1

        Note that embeddings are compatible in lattices of such finite fields::

            sage: m = GF(3^5, conway=True, prefix='z'); c = m.gen()
            sage: (a+b)+c == a+(b+c) # indirect doctest
            True
            sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
            sage: n = pushout(k, l)
            sage: o = pushout(l, m)
            sage: q = pushout(n, o)
            sage: q(o(b)) == q(n(b)) # indirect doctest
            True

        Coercion is also available for number fields::

            sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
            sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^8-x^4+1, embedding=CDF.0)
            sage: M1.<c1> = NumberField(x^2+x+1, embedding=b^4-1)
            sage: M2.<c2> = NumberField(x^2+1, embedding=-b^6)
            sage: M1.coerce_map_from(M2)
            sage: M2.coerce_map_from(M1)
            sage: c1+c2; parent(c1+c2)    #indirect doctest
            -b^6 + b^4 - 1
            Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^8 - x^4 + 1
            sage: pushout(M1['x'],M2['x'])
            Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^8 - x^4 + 1

        In the previous example, the number field ``L`` becomes the pushout
        of ``M1`` and ``M2`` since both are provided with an embedding into
        ``L``, *and* since ``L`` is a number field. If two number fields
        are embedded into a field that is not a numberfield, no merging
        occurs::

            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3-2, embedding=CDF(1/2*I*2^(1/3)*sqrt(3) - 1/2*2^(1/3)))

def pushout(R, S):
    r"""
    Given a pair of Objects R and S, try and construct a
    reasonable object Y and return maps such that
    canonically $R \leftarrow Y \rightarrow S$.

    ALGORITHM:

    This incorporates the idea of functors discussed Sage Days 4.
    Every object R can be viewed as an initial object and
    a series of functors (e.g. polynomial, quotient, extension,
    completion, vector/matrix, etc.). Call the series of
    increasingly-simple rings (with the associated functors)
    the "tower" of R. The construction method is used to
    create the tower.

    Given two objects R and S, try and find a common initial
    object Z. If the towers of R and S meet, let Z be their
    join. Otherwise, see if the top of one coerces naturally into
    the other.

    Now we have an initial object and two ordered lists of
    functors to apply. We wish to merge these in an unambiguous order,
    popping elements off the top of one or the other tower as we
    apply them to Z.

    - If the functors are distinct types, there is an absolute ordering
      given by the rank attribute. Use this.

    - Otherwise:

      - If the tops are equal, we (try to) merge them.

      - If exactly one occurs lower in the other tower
        we may unambiguously apply the other (hoping for a later merge).

      - If the tops commute, we can apply either first.

      - Otherwise fail due to ambiguity.

    EXAMPLES:

    Here our "towers" are $R = Complete_7(Frac(\ZZ))$ and $Frac(Poly_x(\ZZ))$,
    which give us $Frac(Poly_x(Complete_7(Frac(\ZZ))))$::

        sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
        sage: pushout(Qp(7), Frac(ZZ['x']))
        Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 7-adic Field with capped relative precision 20

    Note we get the same thing with
    ::

        sage: pushout(Zp(7), Frac(QQ['x']))
        Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 7-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
        sage: pushout(Zp(7)['x'], Frac(QQ['x']))
        Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 7-adic Field with capped relative precision 20

    Note that polynomial variable ordering must be unambiguously determined.

def pushout_lattice(R, S):
    r"""
    Given a pair of Objects $R$ and $S$, try and construct a
    reasonable object $Y$ and return maps such that
    canonically $R \leftarrow Y \rightarrow S$.

    ALGORITHM:

    This is based on the model that arose from much discussion at Sage Days 4.
    Going up the tower of constructions of $R$ and $S$ (e.g. the reals
    come from the rationals come from the integers) try and find a
    common parent, and then try and fill in a lattice with these
    two towers as sides with the top as the common ancestor and
    the bottom will be the desired ring.

    See the code for a specific worked-out example.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout_lattice
        sage: A, B = pushout_lattice(Qp(7), Frac(ZZ['x']))
        sage: A.codomain()
        Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 7-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
        sage: A.codomain() is B.codomain()
        True
        sage: A, B = pushout_lattice(ZZ, MatrixSpace(ZZ[['x']], 3, 3))
        sage: B
        Identity endomorphism of Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
