        The shuffle product of the two words ``w1`` and ``w2``.

        If `u` and `v` are two words, then the *shuffle product* of
        `u` and `v` is a certain multiset of words defined as follows:
        Let `a` and `b` be the lengths of `u` and `v`, respectively.
        For every `a`-element subset `I` of `\{1, 2, \cdots, a+b\}`,
        let `w(I)` be the length-`a+b` word such that:

        - for every `1 \leq k \leq a`, the `i_k`-th letter of `w(I)`
          is the `k`-th letter of `u`, where `i_k` is the
          `k`-th smallest element of `I`;

        - for every `1 \leq l \leq b`, the `j_l`-th letter of `w(I)`
          is the `l`-th letter of `v`, where `j_l` is the
          `l`-th smallest element of
          `\{1, 2, \cdots, a+b\} \setminus I`.

        The shuffle product of `u` and `v` is then the multiset of
        all `w(I)` with `I` ranging over the `a`-element subsets of
        `\{1, 2, \cdots, a+b\}`.

    def __init__(self, w1, w2):
        r"""
        The overlapping shuffle product of the two words ``w1`` and
        ``w2``.

        If `u` and `v` are two words whose letters belong to an
        additive monoid or to another kind of alphabet on which addition
        is well-defined, then the *overlapping shuffle product* of
        `u` and `v` is a certain multiset of words defined as follows:
        Let `a` and `b` be the lengths of `u` and `v`, respectively.
        Let `A` be the set `\{(0, 1), (0, 2), \cdots, (0, a)\}`, and
        let `B` be the set `\{(1, 1), (1, 2), \cdots, (1, b)\}`.
        Notice that the sets `A` and `B` are disjoint. We can make
        `A` and `B` into posets by setting `(k, i) \leq (k, j)` for
        all `k \in \{0, 1\}` and `i \leq j`. Then, `A \cup B` becomes
        a poset by disjoint union (we don't set `(0, i) \leq (1, i)`).
        Let `p` be the map from `A \cup B` to the set of all letters
        which sends every `(0, i)` to the `i`-th letter of `u`, and
        every `(1, j)` to the `j`-th letter of `v`. For every
        nonnegative integer `c` and every surjective map
        `f : A \cup B \to \{ 1, 2, \cdots, c \}` for which both
        restrictions `f \mid_A` and `f \mid_B` are strictly increasing,
        let `w(f)` be the length-`c` word such that for every
        `1 \leq k \leq c`, the `k`-th letter of `w(f)` equals
        `\sum_{j \in f^{-1}(k)} p(j)` (this sum always has either
        one or two addends). The overlapping shuffle product of `u`
        and `v` is then the multiset of all `w(f)` with `c` ranging
        over all nonnegative integers and `f` ranging
        over the surjective maps
        `f : A \cup B \to \{ 1, 2, \cdots, c \}` for which both
        restrictions `f \mid_A` and `f \mid_B` are strictly increasing.

        If one restricts `c` to a particular fixed nonnegative
        integer, then the multiset is instead called the *overlapping
        shuffle product with precisely `a + b - c` overlaps*. This is
        nonempty only if `\max \{a, b\} \leq c \leq a + b`.

        If `c = a + b`, then the overlapping shuffle product with
        precisely `a + b - c` overlaps is plainly the shuffle product
        (:class:`ShuffleProduct_w1w2`).
