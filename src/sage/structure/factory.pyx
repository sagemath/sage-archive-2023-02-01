Factory for cached representations

.. SEEALSO::

    :mod:`sage.structure.unique_representation`

Using a :class:`UniqueFactory` is one way of implementing a *cached
representation behaviour*. In spite of its name, using a
:class:`UniqueFactory` is not enough to ensure the *unique representation
behaviour*. See :mod:`~sage.structure.unique_representation` for a
detailed explanation.

With a :class:`UniqueFactory`, one can preprocess the given arguments. There
is special support for specifying a subset of the arguments that serve as the
unique key, so that still *all* given arguments are used to create a new
instance, but only the specified subset is used to look up in the
cache. Typically, this is used to construct objects that accept an optional
``check=[True|False]`` argument, but whose result should be unique
regardless of said optional argument. (This use case should be handled with
care, though: Any checking which isn't done in the ``create_key`` or
``create_key_and_extra_args`` method will be done only when a new object is
generated, but not when a cached object is retrieved from cache.
Consequently, if the factory is once called with ``check=False``, a
subsequent call with ``check=True`` cannot be expected to perform all checks
unless these checks are all in the ``create_key`` or
``create_key_and_extra_args`` method.)

For a class derived from
:class:`~sage.structure.unique_representation.CachedRepresentation`, argument
preprocessing can be obtained by providing a custom static ``__classcall__``
or ``__classcall_private__`` method, but this seems less transparent. When
argument preprocessing is not needed or the preprocess is not very
sophisticated, then generally
:class:`~sage.structure.unique_representation.CachedRepresentation` is much
easier to use than a factory.

cdef class UniqueFactory(SageObject):
    """
    This class is intended to make it easy to cache objects.

    It is based on the idea that the object is uniquely defined by a set of
    defining data (the key). There is also the possibility of some
    non-defining data (extra args) which will be used in initial creation,
    but not affect the caching.

    .. WARNING::

        This class only provides *cached representation behaviour*. Hence,
        using :class:`UniqueFactory`, it is still possible to create distinct
        objects that evaluate equal. Unique representation behaviour can be
        added, for example, by additionally inheriting from
        :class:`sage.misc.fast_methods.WithEqualityById`.

    The objects created are cached (using weakrefs) based on their key and
    returned directly rather than re-created if requested again. Pickling is
    taken care of by the factory, and will return the same object for the same
    version of Sage, and distinct (but hopefully equal) objects for different
    versions of Sage.

    .. WARNING::

        The objects returned by a :class:`UniqueFactory` must be instances of
        new style classes (hence, they must be instances of :class:`object`)
        that must not only allow a weak reference, but must accept general
        attribute assignment. Otherwise, pickling won't work.

    USAGE:

    A *unique factory* provides a way to create objects from parameters
    (the type of these objects can depend on the parameters, and is often
    determined only at runtime) and to cache them by a certain key
    derived from these parameters, so that when the factory is being
    called again with the same parameters (or just with parameters which
    yield the same key), the object is being returned from cache rather
    than constructed anew.

    An implementation of a unique factory consists of a factory class and
    an instance of this factory class.

    The factory class has to be a class inheriting from ``UniqueFactory``.
    Typically it only needs to implement :meth:`create_key` (a method that
    creates a key from the given parameters, under which key the object
    will be stored in the cache) and :meth:`create_object` (a method that
    returns the actual object from the key). Sometimes, one would also
    implement :meth:`create_key_and_extra_args` (this differs from
    :meth:`create_key` in allowing to also create some additional
    arguments from the given parameters, which arguments then get passed
    to :meth:`create_object` and thus can have an effect on the initial
    creation of the object, but do *not* affect the key) or
    :meth:`other_keys`. Other methods are not supposed to be overloaded.

    The factory class itself cannot be called to create objects. Instead,
    an instance of the factory class has to be created first. For
    technical reasons, this instance has to be provided with a name that
    allows Sage to find its definition. Specifically, the name of the
    factory instance (or the full path to it, if it is not in the global
    namespace) has to be passed to the factory class as a string variable.
    So, if our factory class has been called ``A`` and is located in
    ``sage/spam/battletoads.py``, then we need to define an instance (say,
    ``B``) of ``A`` by writing ``B = A("sage.spam.battletoads.B")``
    (or ``B = A("B")`` if this ``B`` will be imported into global
    namespace). This instance can then be used to create objects (by
    calling ``B(*parameters)``).

    Notice that the objects created by the factory don't inherit from the
    factory class. They *do* know about the factory that created them (this
    information, along with the keys under which this factory caches them,
    is stored in the ``_factory_data`` attributes of the objects), but not
    via inheritance.

    EXAMPLES:

    The below examples are rather artificial and illustrate particular
    aspects. For a "real-life" usage case of ``UniqueFactory``, see
    the finite field factory in :mod:`sage.rings.finite_rings.constructor`.

    In many cases, a factory class is implemented by providing the two
    methods :meth:`create_key` and :meth:`create_object`. In our example,
    we want to demonstrate how to use "extra arguments" to choose a specific
    implementation, with preference given to an instance found in the cache,
    even if its implementation is different. Hence, we implement
    :meth:`create_key_and_extra_args` rather than :meth:`create_key`, putting
    the chosen implementation into the extra arguments. Then, in the
    :meth:`create_object` method, we create and return instances of the
    specified implementation.
    ::

        sage: from sage.structure.factory import UniqueFactory
        sage: class MyFactory(UniqueFactory):
        ....:     def create_key_and_extra_args(self, *args, **kwds):
        ....:         return args, {'impl':kwds.get('impl', None)}
        ....:     def create_object(self, version, key, **extra_args):
        ....:         impl = extra_args['impl']
        ....:         if impl=='C':
        ....:             return C(*key)
        ....:         if impl=='D':
        ....:             return D(*key)
        ....:         return E(*key)
        ....:

    Now we can create a factory instance. It is supposed to be found under the
    name ``"F"`` in the ``"__main__"`` module. Note that in an interactive
    session, ``F`` would automatically be in the ``__main__`` module. Hence,
    the second and third of the following four lines are only needed in
    doctests.  ::

        sage: F = MyFactory("__main__.F")
        sage: import __main__
        sage: __main__.F = F
        sage: loads(dumps(F)) is F
        True

    Now we create three classes ``C``, ``D`` and ``E``. The first is a Cython
    extension-type class that does not allow weak references nor attribute
    assignment. The second is a Python class that is not derived from
    :class:`object`. The third allows attribute assignment and is derived
    from :class:`object`.  ::

        sage: cython("cdef class C: pass")
        sage: class D:
        ....:     def __init__(self, *args):
        ....:         self.t = args
        ....:     def __repr__(self):
        ....:         return "D%s"%repr(self.t)
        ....:
        sage: class E(D, object): pass

    Again, being in a doctest, we need to put the class ``D`` into the
    ``__main__`` module, so that Python can find it::

        sage: import __main__
        sage: __main__.D = D

    It is impossible to create an instance of ``C`` with our factory, since it
    does not allow weak references::

        sage: F(1, impl='C')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: cannot create weak reference to '....C' object

    Let us try again, with a Cython class that does allow weak
    references. Now, creation of an instance using the factory works::

        sage: cython('''cdef class C:
        ....:     cdef __weakref__
        ....: ''')
        ....:
        sage: c = F(1, impl='C')
        sage: isinstance(c, C)
        True

    The cache is used when calling the factory again---even if it is suggested
    to use a different implementation. This is because the implementation is
    only considered an "extra argument" that does not count for the key.
    ::

        sage: c is F(1, impl='C') is F(1, impl="D") is F(1)
        True

    However, pickling and unpickling does not use the cache. This is because
    the factory has tried to assign an attribute to the instance that provides
    information on the key used to create the instance, but failed::

        sage: loads(dumps(c)) is c
        False
        sage: hasattr(c, '_factory_data')
        False

    We have already seen that our factory will only take the requested
    implementation into account if the arguments used as key have not been
    used yet. So, we use other arguments to create an instance of class
    ``D``::

        sage: d = F(2, impl='D')
        sage: isinstance(d, D)
        True

    The factory only knows about the pickling protocol used by new style
    classes. Hence, again, pickling and unpickling fails to use the cache,
    even though the "factory data" are now available::

        sage: loads(dumps(d)) is d
        False
        sage: d._factory_data
        (<class '__main__.MyFactory'>, (...), (2,), {'impl': 'D'})

    Only when we have a new style class that can be weak referenced and allows
    for attribute assignment, everything works::

        sage: e = F(3)
        sage: isinstance(e, E)
        True
        sage: loads(dumps(e)) is e
        True
        sage: e._factory_data
        (<class '__main__.MyFactory'>, (...), (3,), {'impl': None})

    Register a callable to handle the unpickling from an old
    :class:`UniqueFactory` object.

    :class:`UniqueFactory` pickles use a global name through
    :func:`generic_factory_unpickle()`, so the usual
    :func:`~sage.structure.sage_object.register_unpickle_override()`
    cannot be used here.

    .. SEEALSO::

        :func:`generic_factory_unpickle()`

    TESTS:

    This is similar to the example given in
    :func:`generic_factory_unpickle()`, but here we will use a function to
    explicitly return a polynomial ring.

    First, we create the factory. In a doctest, it is needed to explicitly put
    it into ``__main__``, so that it can be located when pickling. Also, it is
    needed that we work with a new-style class::

        sage: from sage.structure.factory import UniqueFactory, register_factory_unpickle
        sage: import __main__
        sage: class OldStuff(object):
        ....:     def __init__(self, n, **extras):
        ....:         self.n = n
        ....:     def __repr__(self):
        ....:         return "Rotten old thing of level {}".format(self.n)
        sage: __main__.OldStuff = OldStuff
        sage: class MyFactory(UniqueFactory):
        ....:     def create_object(self, version, key, **extras):
        ....:         return OldStuff(key[0])
        ....:     def create_key(self, *args):
        ....:         return args
        sage: G = MyFactory('__main__.G')
        sage: __main__.G = G
        sage: a = G(3); a
        Rotten old thing of level 3
        sage: loads(dumps(a)) is a
        True

    Now, we create a pickle (the string returned by ``dumps(a)``)::

        sage: s = dumps(a)

    We create the function which will handle the unpickling::

        sage: def foo(n, **kwds):
        ....:     return PolynomialRing(QQ, n, 'x')
        sage: register_factory_unpickle('__main__.G', foo)

    The old pickle correctly unpickles as an explicit polynomial ring::

        sage: loads(s)
        Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x0, x1, x2 over Rational Field
    """
    #global factory_unpickles
    factory_unpickles[name] = callable

def generic_factory_unpickle(factory, *args):
    """
    Method used for unpickling the object.

    The unpickling mechanism needs a plain Python function to call.
    It takes a factory as the first argument, passes the rest of the
    arguments onto the factory's :meth:`UniqueFactory.get_object` method.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: V = FreeModule(ZZ, 5)
        sage: func, data = FreeModule.reduce_data(V)
        sage: func is sage.structure.factory.generic_factory_unpickle
        True
        sage: sage.structure.factory.generic_factory_unpickle(*data) is V
        True

    TESTS:

    The following was enabled in :trac:`16349`. Suppose we have defined
    (somewhere in the library of an old Sage version) a unique factory; in our
    example below, it returns polynomial rings. Now suppose that we want to
    replace the factory by something else, say, a class that provides the
    unique parent behaviour using
    :class:`~sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation`. We
    show here how to make it possible to unpickle a pickle created with the
    factory, automatically turning it into an instance of the new class.

    First, we create the factory. In a doctest, it is needed to explicitly put
    it into ``__main__``, so that it can be located when pickling. Also, it is
    needed that we work with a new-style class::

        sage: from sage.structure.factory import UniqueFactory
        sage: import __main__
        sage: class OldStuff(object):
        ....:     def __init__(self, n, **extras):
        ....:         self.n = n
        ....:     def __repr__(self):
        ....:         return "Rotten old thing of level {}".format(self.n)
        sage: __main__.OldStuff = OldStuff
        sage: class MyFactory(UniqueFactory):
        ....:     def create_object(self, version, key, **extras):
        ....:         return OldStuff(key[0])
        ....:     def create_key(self, *args):
        ....:         return args
        sage: F = MyFactory('__main__.F')
        sage: __main__.F = F
        sage: a = F(3); a
        Rotten old thing of level 3
        sage: loads(dumps(a)) is a
        True

    Now, we create a pickle (the string returned by ``dumps(a)``)::

        sage: s = dumps(a)

    We create a new class, derived from
    :class:`~sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation`, that
    shall replace the old factory. In particular, the class has to have the
    same name as the old factory, and has to be put into the same module
    (here: ``__main__``). We turn it into a sub-class of the old class, but
    this is just to save the effort of writing a new init method::

        sage: from sage.structure.unique_representation import UniqueRepresentation
        sage: class F(UniqueRepresentation, OldStuff):
        ....:     def __repr__(self):
        ....:         return "Shiny new thing of level {}".format(self.n)
        sage: __main__.F = F

    The old pickle correctly unpickles as an instance of the new class, which
    is of course different from the instance of the old class, but exhibits
    unique object behaviour as well::

        sage: b = loads(s); b
        Shiny new thing of level 3
        sage: a is b
        False
        sage: loads(dumps(b)) is b
        True
