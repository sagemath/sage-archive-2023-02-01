image:
# Each of these two options works:
# - Directly use the "-with-targets" image built by .github/workflows/tox.yml
#   image: ghcr.io/sagemath/sage/sage-docker-gitpod-standard-with-targets:dev
# - or go through a custom Dockerfile, which builds a smaller image
#   based on the "-with-system-packages" image built by .github/workflows/tox.yml
#   with the built SAGE_LOCAL from the "-with-targets" image copied in.
    file: docker/.gitpod.Dockerfile

# We use the following layout:
#
# $HOME/sage            Source tree used by the Docker build; see SAGE_ROOT/tox.ini (gitpod).
#                       - We delete it in every invocation of the 'before' script
#                         and replace it by a symlink to /workspace/...
#                         (This symlink is needed because the package-removal scripts
#                         ({prefix,venv}/var/lib/sage/scripts/*/{spkg-piprm,spkg-prerm,spkg-postrm)
#                         hardcode SAGE_ROOT and SAGE_SRC from package installation time)
# $HOME/sage/logs       Logs of the Docker build.
#                       - In the first invocation of the 'before' script, we move it
#                         to /workspace/.../logs
# $HOME/sage-local      The configured prefix (SAGE_LOCAL) of the Sage installation.
#                       - During the Docker build, this is the physical location.
#                       - In the first invocation of the 'before' script, we move it
#                         to the new physical location /workspace/.../local
#                         (because gitpod only preserves the contents of /workspace)
#                         and replace it by a symlink to the new physical location.
#                       - In subsequent invocations of the 'before' script, we
#                         remove it and replace it by a symlink to the physical
#                         location /workspace/.../local
# /worktree/.../local   The physical location of the Sage installation,
#                       established in the first run of the 'before' script and
#                       preserved by gitpod.
