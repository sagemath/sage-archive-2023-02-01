This module implements the basic structure of finite cubical
complexes.  For full mathematical details, see Kaczynski, Mischaikow,
and Mrozek [KMM]_, for example.

Cubical complexes are topological spaces built from gluing together
cubes of various dimensions; the collection of cubes must be closed
under taking faces, just as with a simplicial complex.  In this
context, a "cube" means a product of intervals of length 1 or length 0
(degenerate intervals), with integer endpoints, and its faces are
obtained by using the nondegenerate intervals: if `C` is a cube -- a
product of degenerate and nondegenerate intervals -- and if `[i,i+1]`
is the `k`-th nondegenerate factor, then `C` has two faces indexed by
`k`: the cubes obtained by replacing `[i, i+1]` with `[i, i]` or
`[i+1, i+1]`.

So to construct a space homeomorphic to a circle as a cubical complex,
we could take for example the four line segments in the plane from
`(0,2)` to `(0,3)` to `(1,3)` to `(1,2)` to `(0,2)`.  In Sage, this is
done with the following command::

    sage: S1 = CubicalComplex([([0,0], [2,3]), ([0,1], [3,3]), ([0,1], [2,2]), ([1,1], [2,3])]); S1
    Cubical complex with 4 vertices and 8 cubes

The argument to ``CubicalComplex`` is a list of the maximal "cubes" in
the complex.  Each "cube" can be an instance of the class ``Cube`` or
a list (or tuple) of "intervals", and an "interval" is a pair of
integers, of one of the two forms `[i, i]` or `[i, i+1]`.  So the
cubical complex ``S1`` above has four maximal cubes::

    sage: S1.maximal_cells()
    {[0,0] x [2,3], [1,1] x [2,3], [0,1] x [3,3], [0,1] x [2,2]}

The first of these, for instance, is the product of the degenerate
interval `[0,0]` with the unit interval `[2,3]`: this is the line
segment in the plane from `(0,2)` to `(0,3)`.  We could form a
topologically equivalent space by inserting some degenerate simplices::

    sage: S1.homology()
    {0: 0, 1: Z}
    sage: X = CubicalComplex([([0,0], [2,3], [2]), ([0,1], [3,3], [2]), ([0,1], [2,2], [2]), ([1,1], [2,3], [2])])
    sage: X.homology()
    {0: 0, 1: Z}

Topologically, the cubical complex ``X`` consists of four edges of a
square in `\RR^3`: the same unit square as ``S1``, but embedded in
`\RR^3` with `z`-coordinate equal to 2.  Thus ``X`` is homeomorphic to
``S1`` (in fact, they're "cubically equivalent"), and this is
reflected in the fact that they have isomorphic homology groups.

    r"""
    Define a cube for use in constructing a cubical complex.

    "Elementary cubes" are products of intervals with integer
    endpoints, each of which is either a unit interval or a degenerate
    (length 0) interval; for example,

    .. math::

       [0,1] \times [3,4] \times [2,2] \times [1,2]

    is a 3-dimensional cube (since one of the intervals is degenerate)
    embedded in `\RR^4`.

    :param data: list or tuple of terms of the form ``(i,i+1)`` or
      ``(i,i)`` or ``(i,)`` -- the last two are degenerate intervals.
    :return: an elementary cube

    Each cube is stored in a standard form: a tuple of tuples, with a
    nondegenerate interval ``[j,j]`` represented by ``(j,j)``, not
    ``(j,)``.  (This is so that for any interval ``I``, ``I[1]`` will
    produce a value, not an ``IndexError``.)

        Given two cubes ``self`` and ``other``, describe how to
        transform them so that they become equal.

        :param other: a cube of the same dimension as ``self``
        :return: a triple ``(insert_self, insert_other, translate)``.
          ``insert_self`` is a tuple with entries ``(index, (list of
          degenerate intervals))``.  ``insert_other`` is similar.
          ``translate`` is a tuple of integers, suitable as a second
          argument for the ``_translate`` method.

        To do this, ``self`` and ``other`` must have the same
        dimension; degenerate intervals from ``other`` are added to
        ``self``, and vice versa.  Intervals in ``other`` are
        translated so that they coincide with the intervals in
        ``self``.  The output is a triple, as noted above: in the
        tuple ``insert_self``, an entry like ``(3, (3, 4, 0))`` means
        that in position 3 in ``self``, insert the degenerate
        intervals ``[3,3]``, ``[4,4]``, and ``[0,0]``.  The same goes
        for ``insert_other``.  After applying the translations to the
        cube ``other``, call ``_translate`` with argument the tuple
        ``translate``.

        This is used in forming connected sums of cubical complexes:
        the two complexes are modified, via this method, so that they
        have a cube which matches up, then those matching cubes are
        removed.

        In the example below, this method is called with arguments
        ``C1`` and ``C2``, where

        .. math::

            C1 = [0,1] \times [3] \times [4] \times [6,7] \\
            C2 = [2] \times [7,8] \times [9] \times [1,2] \times [0] \times [5]

        To C1, we need to add [2] in position 0 and [0] and [5] in
        position 5.  To C2, we need to add [4] in position 3.  Once
        this has been done, we need to translate the new C2 by the
        vector ``(0, -7, -6, 0, 5, 0, 0)``.

        EXAMPLES::

        Triangulate this cube by "pulling vertices," as described by
        Hetyei.  Return a list of simplices which triangulate

        ALGORITHM:

        If the cube is given by

        .. math::

           C = [i_1, j_1] \times [i_2, j_2] \times ... \times [i_k, j_k]

        let `v_1` be the "upper" corner of `C`: `v` is the point
        `(j_1, ..., j_k)`.  Choose a coordinate `n` where the interval
        `[i_n, j_n]` is non-degenerate and form `v_2` by replacing
        `j_n` by `i_n`; repeat to define `v_3`, etc.  The last vertex
        so defined will be `(i_1, ..., i_k)`.  These vertices define a
        simplex, as do the vertices obtained by making different
        choices at each stage.  Return the list of such simplices;
        thus if `C` is `n`-dimensional, then it is subdivided into
        `n!` simplices.

        Subdivide this cube into pairs of cubes.

        This provides a cubical approximation for the diagonal map
        `K \to K \times K`.

        INPUT:

        - ``dim`` -- integer between 0 and one more than the
          dimension of this cube

        OUTPUT:

        - a list containing triples ``(coeff, left, right)``

        This uses the algorithm described by Pilarczyk and Réal [PR]_
        on p. 267; the formula is originally due to Serre.  Calling
        this method ``alexander_whitney`` is an abuse of notation,
        since the actual Alexander-Whitney map goes from `C(K \times
        L) \to C(K) \otimes C(L)`, where `C(-)` denotes the associated
        chain complex, but this subdivision of cubes is at the heart
        of it.

    Define a cubical complex.

    :param maximal_faces: set of maximal faces
    :param maximality_check: see below
    :type maximality_check: boolean; optional, default True
    :return: a cubical complex

    ``maximal_faces`` should be a list or tuple or set (or anything
    which may be converted to a set) of "cubes": instances of the
    class :class:`Cube`, or lists or tuples suitable for conversion to
    cubes.  These cubes are the maximal cubes in the complex.

    In addition, ``maximal_faces`` may be a cubical complex, in which
    case that complex is returned.  Also, ``maximal_faces`` may
    instead be any object which has a ``_cubical_`` method (e.g., a
    simplicial complex); then that method is used to convert the
    object to a cubical complex.

    If ``maximality_check`` is True, check that each maximal face is,
    in fact, maximal. In this case, when producing the internal
    representation of the cubical complex, omit those that are not.
    It is highly recommended that this be True; various methods for
    this class may fail if faces which are claimed to be maximal are
    in fact not.

        INPUT:

        - ``base_ring`` - coefficient ring (optional, default
          ``QQ``). Must be a field.

        Denote by `C` the chain complex associated to this cubical
        complex. The algebraic topological model is a chain complex
        `M` with zero differential, with the same homology as `C`,
        along with chain maps `\pi: C \to M` and `\iota: M \to C`
        satisfying `\iota \pi = 1_M` and `\pi \iota` chain homotopic
        to `1_C`. The chain homotopy `\phi` must satisfy

        - `\phi \phi = 0`,
        - `\pi \phi = 0`,
        - `\phi \iota = 0`.

        Such a chain homotopy is called a *chain contraction*.

        OUTPUT: a pair consisting of

        - chain contraction ``phi`` associated to `C`, `M`, `\pi`, and
          `\iota`
        - the chain complex `M`

        Note that from the chain contraction ``phi``, one can recover the
        chain maps `\pi` and `\iota` via ``phi.pi()`` and
        ``phi.iota()``. Then one can recover `C` and `M` from, for
        example, ``phi.pi().domain()`` and ``phi.pi().codomain()``,
        respectively.

        let `v_1` be the "upper" corner of `C`: `v` is the point
        `(j_1, ..., j_k)`.  Choose a coordinate `n` where the interval
        `[i_n, j_n]` is non-degenerate and form `v_2` by replacing
        `j_n` by `i_n`; repeat to define `v_3`, etc.  The last vertex
        so defined will be `(i_1, ..., i_k)`.  These vertices define a
        simplex, and do the vertices obtained by making different
        choices at each stage.  Thus each `n`-cube is subdivided into
        `n!` simplices.
