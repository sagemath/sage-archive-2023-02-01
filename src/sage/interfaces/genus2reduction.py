Conductor and reduction types for genus 2 curves

AUTHORS:

- Qing Liu and Henri Cohen (1994-1998): wrote genus2reduction C
  program

- William Stein (2006-03-05): wrote Sage interface to genus2reduction

- Jeroen Demeyer (2014-09-17): replace genus2reduction program by PARI
  library call (:trac:`15808`)

ACKNOWLEDGMENT: (From Liu's website:) Many thanks to Henri Cohen who started
writing this program. After this program is available, many people pointed out
to me (mathematical as well as programming) bugs : B. Poonen, E. Schaefer, C.
Stahlke, M. Stoll, F. Villegas.  So thanks to all of them. Thanks also go to
Ph. Depouilly who help me to compile the program.

Also Liu has given me explicit permission to include genus2reduction with Sage
and for people to modify the C source code however they want.

class ReductionData(SageObject):
    r"""
    Reduction data for a genus 2 curve.

    How to read ``local_data`` attribute, i.e., if this
    class is R, then the following is the meaning of
    ``R.local_data[p]``.

    For each prime number `p` dividing the discriminant of
    `y^2+Q(x)y=P(x)`, there are two lines.

    The first line contains information about the stable reduction
    after field extension. Here are the meanings of the symbols of
    stable reduction:

    (I) The stable reduction is smooth (i.e. the curve has potentially
    good reduction).

    (II) The stable reduction is an elliptic curve `E` with an
    ordinary double point. `j` mod `p` is the modular
    invariant of `E`.

    (III) The stable reduction is a projective line with two ordinary
    double points.

    (IV) The stable reduction is two projective lines crossing
    transversally at three points.

    (V) The stable reduction is the union of two elliptic curves
    `E_1` and `E_2` intersecting transversally at one
    point. Let `j_1`, `j_2` be their modular
    invariants, then `j_1+j_2` and `j_1 j_2` are
    computed (they are numbers mod `p`).

    (VI) The stable reduction is the union of an elliptic curve
    `E` and a projective line which has an ordinary double
    point. These two components intersect transversally at one point.
    `j` mod `p` is the modular invariant of
    `E`.

    (VII) The stable reduction is as above, but the two components are
    both singular.

    In the cases (I) and (V), the Jacobian `J(C)` has
    potentially good reduction. In the cases (III), (IV) and (VII),
    `J(C)` has potentially multiplicative reduction. In the two
    remaining cases, the (potential) semi-abelian reduction of
    `J(C)` is extension of an elliptic curve (with modular
    invariant `j` mod `p`) by a torus.

    The second line contains three data concerning the reduction at
    `p` without any field extension.


    #. The first symbol describes the REDUCTION AT `p` of
       `C`. We use the symbols of Namikawa-Ueno for the type of
       the reduction (Namikawa, Ueno:"The complete classification of
       fibers in pencils of curves of genus two", Manuscripta Math., vol.
       9, (1973), pages 143-186.) The reduction symbol is followed by the
       corresponding page number (or just an indication) in the above
       article. The lower index is printed by , for instance, [I2-II-5]
       means [I_2-II-5]. Note that if `K` and `K'` are
       Kodaira symbols for singular fibers of elliptic curves, [K-K'-m]
       and [K'-K-m] are the same type. Finally, [K-K'-1] (not the same as
       [K-K'-1]) is [K'-K-alpha] in the notation of Namikawa-Ueno. The
       figure [2I_0-m] in Namikawa-Ueno, page 159 must be denoted by
       [2I_0-(m+1)].

    #. The second datum is the GROUP OF CONNECTED COMPONENTS (over an
       ALGEBRAIC CLOSURE (!) of `\GF{p}`) of the Neron
       model of J(C). The symbol (n) means the cyclic group with n
       elements. When n=0, (0) is the trivial group (1).
       ``Hn`` is isomorphic to (2)x(2) if n is even and to (4)
       otherwise.

       Note - The set of rational points of `\Phi` can be computed
       using Theorem 1.17 in S. Bosch and Q. Liu "Rational points of the
       group of components of a Neron model", Manuscripta Math. 98 (1999),
       275-293.

    #. Finally, `f` is the exponent of the conductor of
       `J(C)` at `p`.


    .. warning::

       Be careful regarding the formula:

       .. MATH::

          \text{valuation of the naive minimal discriminant} = f + n - 1 + 11c(X).

       (Q. Liu : "Conducteur et discriminant minimal de courbes de genre
       2", Compositio Math. 94 (1994) 51-79, Theoreme 2) is valid only if
       the residual field is algebraically closed as stated in the paper.
       So this equality does not hold in general over
       `\QQ_p`. The fact is that the minimal discriminant
       may change after unramified extension. One can show however that,
       at worst, the change will stabilize after a quadratic unramified
       extension (Q. Liu : "Modèles entiers de courbes hyperelliptiques
       sur un corps de valuation discrète", Trans. AMS 348 (1996),
       4577-4610, Section 7.2, Proposition 4).

    The discriminant is always minimal away from 2, but possibly not at

    Here are some examples of curves with modular Jacobians::

        sage: R = genus2reduction(x^3 + x + 1, -2*x^5 - 3*x^2 + 2*x - 2)
        sage: factor(R.conductor)

        5^6

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: genus2reduction(0, x^6 + 3*x^3 + 63)
        Reduction data about this proper smooth genus 2 curve:
                y^2 = x^6 + 3*x^3 + 63
        A Minimal Equation (away from 2):
                y^2 = x^6 + 3*x^3 + 63
        Minimal Discriminant (away from 2):  10628388316852992
        Conductor (away from 2): 2893401

                p=7
                (potential) stable reduction:  (V), j1+j2=0, j1*j2=0
                reduction at p: [I{0}-II-0] page 159, (1), f=2

    In the above example, Liu remarks that in fact at `p=2`,
    the reduction is [II-II-0] page 163, (1), `f=8`. So the
    conductor of J(C) is actually `2 \cdot 2893401=5786802`.

    A MODULAR CURVE:

    Consider the modular curve `X_1(13)` defined by an
    equation

    .. MATH::

                   y^2 + (x^3-x^2-1)y = x^2 - x.



    We have::

        sage: genus2reduction(x^3-x^2-1, x^2 - x)
        Reduction data about this proper smooth genus 2 curve:
                y^2 + (x^3 - x^2 - 1)*y = x^2 - x
        A Minimal Equation (away from 2):
                y^2 = x^6 + 58*x^5 + 1401*x^4 + 18038*x^3 + 130546*x^2 + 503516*x + 808561
        Minimal Discriminant (away from 2):  169
        Conductor: 169
        Local Data:
                p=13
                (potential) stable reduction:  (V), j1+j2=0, j1*j2=0
                reduction at p: [I{0}-II-0] page 159, (1), f=2

    So the curve has good reduction at 2. At `p=13`, the stable
    reduction is union of two elliptic curves, and both of them have 0
    as modular invariant. The reduction at 13 is of type [I_0-II-0]
    (see Namikawa-Ueno, page 159). It is an elliptic curve with a cusp.
    The group of connected components of the Neron model of
    `J(C)` is trivial, and the exponent of the conductor of
    `J(C)` at `13` is `f=2`. The conductor of
    `J(C)` is `13^2`. (Note: It is a theorem of
    Conrad-Edixhoven-Stein that the component group of
    `J(X_1(p))` is trivial for all primes `p`.)
