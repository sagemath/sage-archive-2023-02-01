Networking and Grid Computing
=============================

Sage includes custom highly-integrated support for coarse grain
distributed (or "grid") computing. See the chapter below on
``dsage``.

Sage includes the Moin Moin Wiki by default, which
"is an advanced, easy to use and extensible WikiEngine with a large
community of users. Said in a few words, it is about collaboration on
easily editable web pages."

The Twisted, an event-driven networking framework written in
Python, is a networking library that is included with Sage. It is
robust, mature, fast, and offers a vast range of networking
functionality.

The Sage Notebook (see Chapter :ref:`ch:notebook`) is another
networking application included with Sage.
