Rational polyhedral fans

This module was designed as a part of the framework for toric varieties
(:mod:`~sage.schemes.toric.variety`,
:mod:`~sage.schemes.toric.fano_variety`). While the emphasis is on
complete full-dimensional fans, arbitrary fans are supported. Work
with distinct lattices. The default lattice is :class:`ToricLattice
<sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>` `N` of the appropriate
dimension. The only case when you must specify lattice explicitly is creation
of a 0-dimensional fan, where dimension of the ambient space cannot be
guessed.

A **rational polyhedral fan** is a *finite* collection of *strictly* convex
rational polyhedral cones, such that the intersection of any two cones of the
fan is a face of each of them and each face of each cone is also a cone of the
fan.

  Volker Braun.

EXAMPLES:

Use :func:`Fan` to construct fans "explicitly"::

    sage: fan = Fan(cones=[(0,1), (1,2)],
    ....:           rays=[(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
    sage: fan
    Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N

In addition to giving such lists of cones and rays you can also create cones
first using :func:`~sage.geometry.cone.Cone` and then combine them into a fan.
See the documentation of :func:`Fan` for details.

In 2 dimensions there is a unique maximal fan determined by rays, and
you can use :func:`Fan2d` to construct it::

    sage: fan2d = Fan2d(rays=[(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0)])
    sage: fan2d.is_equivalent(fan)
    True

But keep in mind that in higher dimensions the cone data is essential
and cannot be omitted. Instead of building a fan from scratch, for
this tutorial we will use an easy way to get two fans associated to
:class:`lattice polytopes
<sage.geometry.lattice_polytope.LatticePolytopeClass>`:
:func:`FaceFan` and :func:`NormalFan`::

    sage: fan1 = FaceFan(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3))
    sage: fan2 = NormalFan(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3))

Given such "automatic" fans, you may wonder what are their rays and cones::

    sage: fan1.rays()
    M( 1,  0,  0),
    M( 0,  1,  0),
    M( 0,  0,  1),
    M(-1,  0,  0),
    M( 0, -1,  0),
    M( 0,  0, -1)
    in 3-d lattice M
    sage: fan1.generating_cones()
    (3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M)

The last output is not very illuminating. Let's try to improve it::

    sage: for cone in fan1: print(cone.rays())
    M( 0, 1, 0),
    M( 0, 0, 1),
    M(-1, 0, 0)
    in 3-d lattice M
    M( 0,  0, 1),
    M(-1,  0, 0),
    M( 0, -1, 0)
    in 3-d lattice M
    M(-1,  0,  0),
    M( 0, -1,  0),
    M( 0,  0, -1)
    in 3-d lattice M
    M( 0, 1,  0),
    M(-1, 0,  0),
    M( 0, 0, -1)
    in 3-d lattice M
    M(1, 0,  0),
    M(0, 1,  0),
    M(0, 0, -1)
    in 3-d lattice M
    M(1, 0, 0),
    M(0, 1, 0),
    M(0, 0, 1)
    in 3-d lattice M
    M(1,  0, 0),
    M(0,  0, 1),
    M(0, -1, 0)
    in 3-d lattice M
    M(1,  0,  0),
    M(0, -1,  0),
    M(0,  0, -1)
    in 3-d lattice M

You can also do ::

    sage: for cone in fan1: print(cone.ambient_ray_indices())
    (1, 2, 3)
    (2, 3, 4)
    (3, 4, 5)
    (1, 3, 5)
    (0, 1, 5)
    (0, 1, 2)
    (0, 2, 4)
    (0, 4, 5)

to see indices of rays of the fan corresponding to each cone.

While the above cycles were over "cones in fan", it is obvious that we did not
get ALL the cones: every face of every cone in a fan must also be in the fan,
but all of the above cones were of dimension three. The reason for this
behaviour is that in many cases it is enough to work with generating cones of
the fan, i.e. cones which are not faces of bigger cones. When you do need to
work with lower dimensional cones, you can easily get access to them using
:meth:`~sage.geometry.fan.RationalPolyhedralFan.cones`::

    sage: [cone.ambient_ray_indices() for cone in fan1.cones(2)]
    [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (0, 4),
     (2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (0, 5)]

In fact, you do not have to type ``.cones``::

    sage: [cone.ambient_ray_indices() for cone in fan1(2)]
    [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (0, 4),
     (2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (0, 5)]

You may also need to know the inclusion relations between all of the cones of
the fan. In this case check out
:meth:`~sage.geometry.fan.RationalPolyhedralFan.cone_lattice`::

    sage: L = fan1.cone_lattice()
    sage: L
    Finite lattice containing 28 elements with distinguished linear extension
    sage: L.bottom()
    0-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M
    sage: L.top()
    Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M
    sage: cone = L.level_sets()[2][0]
    sage: cone
    2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M
    sage: sorted(L.hasse_diagram().neighbors(cone))
    [1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M,
     3-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice M]

You can check how "good" a fan is::

    sage: fan1.is_complete()
    True
    sage: fan1.is_simplicial()
    True
    sage: fan1.is_smooth()
    True

The face fan of the octahedron is really good! Time to remember that we have
also constructed its normal fan::

    sage: fan2.is_complete()
    True
    sage: fan2.is_simplicial()
    False
    sage: fan2.is_smooth()
    False

This one does have some "problems," but we can fix them::

    sage: fan3 = fan2.make_simplicial()
    sage: fan3.is_simplicial()
    True
    sage: fan3.is_smooth()
    False

Note that we had to save the result of
:meth:`~sage.geometry.fan.RationalPolyhedralFan.make_simplicial` in a new fan.
Fans in Sage are immutable, so any operation that does change them constructs
a new fan.

We can also make ``fan3`` smooth, but it will take a bit more work::

    sage: cube = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).polar()
    sage: sk = cube.skeleton_points(2)
    sage: rays = [cube.point(p) for p in sk]
    sage: fan4 = fan3.subdivide(new_rays=rays)
    sage: fan4.is_smooth()
    True

Let's see how "different" are ``fan2`` and ``fan4``::

    sage: fan2.ngenerating_cones()
    6
    sage: fan2.nrays()
    8
    sage: fan4.ngenerating_cones()
    48
    sage: fan4.nrays()
    26

Smoothness does not come for free!

Please take a look at the rest of the available functions below and their
complete descriptions. If you need any features that are missing, feel free to
suggest them. (Or implement them on your own and submit a patch to Sage for
inclusion!)

    Construct a rational polyhedral fan.

    .. NOTE::

        Approximate time to construct a fan consisting of `n` cones is `n^2/5`
        seconds. That is half an hour for 100 cones. This time can be
        significantly reduced in the future, but it is still likely to be
        `\sim n^2` (with, say, `/500` instead of `/5`). If you know that your
        input does form a valid fan, use ``check=False`` option to skip
        consistency checks.

    INPUT:

    - ``cones`` -- list of either
      :class:`Cone<sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>` objects
      or lists of integers interpreted as indices of generating rays in
      ``rays``. These must be only **maximal** cones of the fan, unless
      ``discard_faces=True`` or ``allow_arrangement=True`` option is specified;

    - ``rays`` -- list of rays given as list or vectors convertible to the
      rational extension of ``lattice``. If ``cones`` are given by
      :class:`Cone<sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>` objects
      ``rays`` may be determined automatically. You still may give them
      explicitly to ensure a particular order of rays in the fan. In this case
      you must list all rays that appear in ``cones``. You can give "extra"
      ones if it is convenient (e.g. if you have a big list of rays for
      several fans), but all "extra" rays will be discarded;

    - ``lattice`` -- :class:`ToricLattice
      <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`, `\ZZ^n`, or any
      other object that behaves like these. If not specified, an attempt will
      be made to determine an appropriate toric lattice automatically;

    - ``check`` -- by default the input data will be checked for correctness
      (e.g. that intersection of any two given cones is a face of each),
      unless ``allow_arrangement=True`` option is specified. If you
      know for sure that the input is correct, you may significantly decrease
      construction time using ``check=False`` option;

    - ``normalize`` -- you can further speed up construction using
      ``normalize=False`` option. In this case ``cones`` must be a list of
      **sorted** :class:`tuples` and ``rays`` must be immutable primitive
      vectors in ``lattice``. In general, you should not use this option, it
      is designed for code optimization and does not give as drastic
      improvement in speed as the previous one;

    - ``is_complete`` -- every fan can determine on its own if it is complete
      or not, however it can take quite a bit of time for "big" fans with many
      generating cones. On the other hand, in some situations it is known in
      advance that a certain fan is complete. In this case you can pass
      ``is_complete=True`` option to speed up some computations. You may also
      pass ``is_complete=False`` option, although it is less likely to be
      beneficial. Of course, passing a wrong value can compromise the
      integrity of data structures of the fan and lead to wrong results, so
      you should be very careful if you decide to use this option;

    - ``virtual_rays`` -- (optional, computed automatically if needed) a list of
      ray generators to be used for :meth:`virtual_rays`;

    - ``discard_faces`` -- by default, the fan constructor expects the list of
      **maximal** cones, unless ``allow_arrangement=True`` option is specified.
      If you provide "extra" ones and leave ``allow_arrangement=False`` (default)
      and ``check=True`` (default), an exception will be raised.
      If you provide "extra" cones and set ``allow_arrangement=False`` (default)
      and ``check=False``, you may get wrong results as assumptions on internal
      data structures will be invalid. If you want the fan constructor to
      select the maximal cones from the given input, you may provide
      ``discard_faces=True`` option (it works both for ``check=True`` and
      ``check=False``).

    - ``allow_arrangement`` -- by default (``allow_arrangement=False``),
      the fan constructor expects that the intersection of any two given cones is
      a face of each. If ``allow_arrangement=True`` option is specified, then
      construct a rational polyhedralfan from the cone arrangement, so that the
      union of the cones in the polyhedral fan equals to the union of the given
      cones, and each given cone is the union of some cones in the polyhedral fan.

    OUTPUT:

    - a :class:`fan <RationalPolyhedralFan>`.

    .. SEEALSO::

        In 2 dimensions you can cyclically order the rays. Hence the
        rays determine a unique maximal fan without having to specify
        the cones, and you can use :func:`Fan2d` to construct this
        fan from just the rays.

    EXAMPLES:

    Let's construct a fan corresponding to the projective plane in several
    ways::

        sage: cone1 = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
        sage: cone2 = Cone([(0,1), (-1,-1)])
        sage: cone3 = Cone([(-1,-1), (1,0)])
        sage: P2 = Fan([cone1, cone2, cone2])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: you have provided 3 cones, but only 2 of them are maximal!
        Use discard_faces=True if you indeed need to construct a fan from
        these cones.

    Oops! There was a typo and ``cone2`` was listed twice as a generating cone
    of the fan. If it was intentional (e.g. the list of cones was generated
    automatically and it is possible that it contains repetitions or faces of
    other cones), use ``discard_faces=True`` option::

        sage: P2 = Fan([cone1, cone2, cone2], discard_faces=True)
        sage: P2.ngenerating_cones()
        2

    However, in this case it was definitely a typo, since the fan of
    `\mathbb{P}^2` has 3 maximal cones::

        sage: P2 = Fan([cone1, cone2, cone3])
        sage: P2.ngenerating_cones()
        3

    Looks better. An alternative way is ::

        sage: rays = [(1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1)]
        sage: cones = [(0,1), (1,2), (2,0)]
        sage: P2a = Fan(cones, rays)
        sage: P2a.ngenerating_cones()
        3
        sage: P2 == P2a
        False

    That may seem wrong, but it is not::

        sage: P2.is_equivalent(P2a)
        True

    See :meth:`~RationalPolyhedralFan.is_equivalent` for details.

    Yet another way to construct this fan is ::

        sage: P2b = Fan(cones, rays, check=False)
        sage: P2b.ngenerating_cones()
        3
        sage: P2a == P2b
        True

    If you try the above examples, you are likely to notice the difference in
    speed, so when you are sure that everything is correct, it is a good idea
    to use ``check=False`` option. On the other hand, it is usually **NOT** a
    good idea to use ``normalize=False`` option::

        sage: P2c = Fan(cones, rays, check=False, normalize=False)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'parent'

    Yet another way is to use functions :func:`FaceFan` and :func:`NormalFan`
    to construct fans from :class:`lattice polytopes
    <sage.geometry.lattice_polytope.LatticePolytopeClass>`.

    We have not yet used ``lattice`` argument, since if was determined
    automatically::

        sage: P2.lattice()
        2-d lattice N
        sage: P2b.lattice()
        2-d lattice N

    However, it is necessary to specify it explicitly if you want to construct
    a fan without rays or cones::

        sage: Fan([], [])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: you must specify the lattice
        when you construct a fan without rays and cones!
        sage: F = Fan([], [], lattice=ToricLattice(2, "L"))
        sage: F
        Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice L
        sage: F.lattice_dim()
        2
        sage: F.dim()
        0

    In the following examples, we test the ``allow_arrangement=True`` option.
    See :trac:`25122`.

    The intersection of the two cones is not a face of each. Therefore,
    they do not belong to the same rational polyhedral fan::

        sage: c1 = Cone([(-2,-1,1), (-2,1,1), (2,1,1), (2,-1,1)])
        sage: c2 = Cone([(-1,-2,1), (-1,2,1), (1,2,1), (1,-2,1)])
        sage: c1.intersection(c2).is_face_of(c1)
        False
        sage: c1.intersection(c2).is_face_of(c2)
        False
        sage: Fan([c1, c2])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: these cones cannot belong to the same fan!
        ...

    Let's construct the fan using ``allow_arrangement=True`` option::

        sage: fan = Fan([c1, c2], allow_arrangement=True)
        sage: fan.ngenerating_cones()
        5

    Another example where cone c2 is inside cone c1::

        sage: c1 = Cone([(4, 0, 0), (0, 4, 0), (0, 0, 4)])
        sage: c2 = Cone([(2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2)])
        sage: fan = Fan([c1, c2], allow_arrangement=True)
        sage: fan.ngenerating_cones()
        7
        sage: fan.plot()  # optional - sage.plot
        Graphics3d Object

    Cones of different dimension::

        sage: c1 = Cone([(1,0),(0,1)])
        sage: c2 = Cone([(2,1)])
        sage: c3 = Cone([(-1,-2)])
        sage: fan = Fan([c1, c2, c3], allow_arrangement=True)
        sage: for cone in sorted(fan.generating_cones()): print(sorted(cone.rays()))
        [N(-1, -2)]
        [N(0, 1), N(1, 2)]

    Construct a cone belonging to a fan.

    .. WARNING::

        This class does not check that the input defines a valid cone of a
        fan. You must not construct objects of this class directly.

    In addition to all of the properties of "regular" :class:`cones
    <sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>`, such cones know their
    relation to the fan.

    INPUT:

    - ``ambient`` -- fan whose cone is constructed;

    - ``ambient_ray_indices`` -- increasing list or tuple of integers, indices
      of rays of ``ambient`` generating this cone.

    OUTPUT:

    - cone of ``ambient``.

    EXAMPLES:

    The intended way to get objects of this class is the following::

        sage: fan = toric_varieties.P1xP1().fan()
        sage: cone = fan.generating_cone(0)
        sage: cone

        This class does not perform any checks of correctness of input nor

      other object that behaves like these. If ``None``, it will be determined

        We use different algorithms depending on available information. One of
        the common cases is a fan which is KNOWN to be complete, i.e. we do
        not even need to check if it is complete.

            sage: fan = toric_varieties.P1xP1().fan()
            sage: fan.cone_lattice() # indirect doctest
            Finite lattice containing 10 elements with distinguished linear extension

        These 10 elements are: 1 origin, 4 rays, 4 generating cones, 1 fan.

        Another common case is the fan of faces of a single cone::

            sage: quadrant = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
            sage: fan = Fan([quadrant])
            sage: fan.cone_lattice() # indirect doctest
            Finite poset containing 5 elements with distinguished linear extension

        These 5 elements are: 1 origin, 2 rays, 1 generating cone, 1 fan.

        A subcase of this common case is treatment of fans consisting of the
        origin only, which used to be handled incorrectly :trac:`18613`::

            sage: fan = Fan([Cone([], ToricLattice(0))])
            sage: list(fan.cone_lattice())

            [0-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 1-d lattice N,
             Rational polyhedral fan in 1-d lattice N]

        Finally, we have "intermediate" fans which are incomplete but are
        generated by more than one cone::

            sage: cone1 = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])

          :class:`cone of fan<Cone_of_fan>`).

        See also :meth:`cones`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Cone lattices can be computed for arbitrary fans::

            sage: cone1 = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
            sage: cone2 = Cone([(-1,0)])
            sage: fan = Fan([cone1, cone2])

            sage: L = fan.cone_lattice()
            sage: L
            Finite poset containing 6 elements with distinguished linear extension

        These 6 elements are the origin, three rays, one two-dimensional
        cone, and the fan itself\ . Since we do add the fan itself as the
        largest face, you should be a little bit careful with this last
        element::

            sage: for face in L: print(face.ambient_ray_indices())
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...

            sage: L.top()
            Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N

        For example, you can do ::

            sage: for l in L.level_sets()[:-1]:
            ....:     print([f.ambient_ray_indices() for f in l])
            [()]
            [(0,), (1,), (2,)]
            [(1, 2)]

        If the fan is complete, its cone lattice is atomic and coatomic and
        can (and will!) be computed in a much more efficient way, but the
        interface is exactly the same::

            sage: fan = toric_varieties.P1xP1().fan()
            sage: L = fan.cone_lattice()
            sage: for l in L.level_sets()[:-1]:
            ....:     print([f.ambient_ray_indices() for f in l])

            [(0,), (1,), (2,), (3,)]
            [(0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3)]

        Let's also consider the cone lattice of a fan generated by a single
        cone::

            sage: fan = Fan([cone1])
            sage: L = fan.cone_lattice()
            sage: L
            Finite poset containing 5 elements with distinguished linear extension

        Here these 5 elements correspond to the origin, two rays, one
        generating cone of dimension two, and the whole fan. While this single
        cone "is" the whole fan, it is consistent and convenient to
        distinguish them in the cone lattice.

        OUTPUT:

        - ``False`` if ``cone`` is not a cone or if ``cone`` is not

        .. NOTE::

            Recall that a fan is a (finite) collection of cones. A
            cone is contained in a fan if it is equivalent to one of
            the cones of the fan. In particular, it is possible that
            all rays of the cone are in the fan, but the cone itself
            is not.

            If you want to know whether a point is in the support of
            the fan, you should use :meth:`support_contains`.

        EXAMPLES:

        We first construct a simple fan::

            sage: cone1 = Cone([(0,-1), (1,0)])
            sage: cone2 = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
            sage: f = Fan([cone1, cone2])

        Now we check if some cones are in this fan. First, we make sure that
        the order of rays of the input cone does not matter (``check=False``
        option ensures that rays of these cones will be listed exactly as they
        are given)::

            sage: f.contains(Cone([(1,0), (0,1)], check=False))
            True
            sage: f.contains(Cone([(0,1), (1,0)], check=False))
            True

        Now we check that a non-generating cone is in our fan::

            sage: f.contains(Cone([(1,0)]))
            True
            sage: Cone([(1,0)]) in f   # equivalent to the previous command
            True

        Finally, we test some cones which are not in this fan::

            sage: f.contains(Cone([(1,1)]))
            False
            sage: f.contains(Cone([(1,0), (-0,1)]))
            True

    def embed(self, cone):

        Return the cone equivalent to the given one, but sitting in ``self``.

        You may need to use this method before calling methods of ``cone`` that
        depend on the ambient structure, such as
        :meth:`~sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.ambient_ray_indices`
        or
        :meth:`~sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.facet_of`. The
        cone returned by this method will have ``self`` as ambient. If ``cone``
        does not represent a valid cone of ``self``, ``ValueError`` exception
        is raised.

        .. NOTE::

            This method is very quick if ``self`` is already the ambient
            structure of ``cone``, so you can use without extra checks and
            performance hit even if ``cone`` is likely to sit in ``self`` but
            in principle may not.

        INPUT:

        - ``cone`` -- a :class:`cone
          <sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone>`.

        OUTPUT:

        - a :class:`cone of fan <Cone_of_fan>`, equivalent to ``cone`` but
          sitting inside ``self``.

        EXAMPLES:

        Let's take a 3-d fan generated by a cone on 4 rays::

            sage: f = Fan([Cone([(1,0,1), (0,1,1), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1)])])

        Then any ray generates a 1-d cone of this fan, but if you construct
        such a cone directly, it will not "sit" inside the fan::

            sage: ray = Cone([(0,-1,1)])
            sage: ray
            1-d cone in 3-d lattice N
            sage: ray.ambient_ray_indices()

            ()
            sage: ray.ambient()
            1-d cone in 3-d lattice N

        If we want to operate with this ray as a part of the fan, we need to
        embed it first::

            sage: e_ray = f.embed(ray)
            sage: e_ray
            1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
            sage: e_ray.rays()
            N(0, -1, 1)
            in 3-d lattice N
            sage: e_ray is ray
            False
            sage: e_ray.is_equivalent(ray)
            True
            sage: e_ray.ambient_ray_indices()
            (3,)
            sage: e_ray.adjacent()

            sage: e_ray.ambient()

        Not every cone can be embedded into a fixed fan::

        of a `d`-dimensional fan `\Sigma` in `N_\RR`. Then the corresponding

        :meth:`~sage.geometry.cone.IntegralRayCollection.rays` of `\Sigma`

        addition of virtual rays is not sufficient to span `N` over `\ZZ`.)

            You may use a particular choice of virtual rays by passing optional

        Return the facets bounding ``cone`` with their induced
        orientation.

        INPUT:

        - ``cone`` -- a cone of the fan or the whole fan.

        OUTPUT:

        The boundary cones of ``cone`` as a formal linear combination
        of cones with coefficients `\pm 1`. Each summand is a facet of
        ``cone`` and the coefficient indicates whether their (chosen)
        orientation agrees or disagrees with the "outward normal
        first" boundary orientation. Note that the orientation of any
        individual cone is arbitrary. This method once and for all
        picks orientations for all cones and then computes the
        boundaries relative to that chosen orientation.

        If ``cone`` is the fan itself, the generating cones with their
        orientation relative to the ambient space are returned.

        See :meth:`complex` for the associated chain complex. If you
        do not require the orientation, use :meth:`cone.facets()
        <sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone.facets>`
        instead.

        Return the chain complex of the fan.

        To a `d`-dimensional fan `\Sigma`, one can canonically
        associate a chain complex `K^\bullet`

        .. MATH::

            0 \longrightarrow
            \ZZ^{\Sigma(d)} \longrightarrow
            \ZZ^{\Sigma(d-1)} \longrightarrow
            \cdots \longrightarrow
            \ZZ^{\Sigma(0)} \longrightarrow
            0

        where the leftmost non-zero entry is in degree `0` and the
        rightmost entry in degree `d`. See [Kly1990]_, eq. (3.2). This
        complex computes the homology of `|\Sigma|\subset N_\RR` with
        arbitrary support,

        .. MATH::

            H_i(K) = H_{d-i}(|\Sigma|, \ZZ)_{\text{non-cpct}}

        For a complete fan, this is just the non-compactly supported
        homology of `\RR^d`. In this case, `H_0(K)=\ZZ` and `0` in all
        non-zero degrees.

        For a complete fan, there is an extended chain complex

        .. MATH::

            0 \longrightarrow
            \ZZ \longrightarrow
            \ZZ^{\Sigma(d)} \longrightarrow
            \ZZ^{\Sigma(d-1)} \longrightarrow
            \cdots \longrightarrow
            \ZZ^{\Sigma(0)} \longrightarrow
            0

        where we take the first `\ZZ` term to be in degree -1. This
        complex is an exact sequence, that is, all homology groups
        vanish.

        The orientation of each cone is chosen as in
        :meth:`oriented_boundary`.

        INPUT:

        - ``extended`` -- Boolean (default:False). Whether to
          construct the extended complex, that is, including the
          `\ZZ`-term at degree -1 or not.

        - ``base_ring`` -- A ring (default: ``ZZ``). The ring to use
          instead of `\ZZ`.

        OUTPUT:

        The complex associated to the fan as a :class:`ChainComplex
        <sage.homology.chain_complex.ChainComplex>`. Raises a
        ``ValueError`` if the extended complex is requested for a
        non-complete fan.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: fan = toric_varieties.P(3).fan()
            sage: K_normal = fan.complex(); K_normal
            Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Integer Ring

            sage: K_extended.homology()
            {-1: 0, 0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0}

        Homology computations are much faster over `\QQ` if you do not
        care about the torsion coefficients::

            sage: toric_varieties.P2_123().fan().complex(extended=True, base_ring=QQ)

             2: Vector space of dimension 0 over Rational Field}

        The extended complex is only defined for complete fans::

            sage: fan = Fan([ Cone([(1,0)]) ])
            sage: fan.is_complete()
            False
            sage: fan.complex(extended=True)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: The extended complex is only defined for complete fans!

        The definition of the complex does not refer to the ambient
        space of the fan, so it does not distinguish a fan from the
        same fan embedded in a subspace::

            sage: K1 = Fan([Cone([(-1,)]), Cone([(1,)])]).complex()
            sage: K2 = Fan([Cone([(-1,0,0)]), Cone([(1,0,0)])]).complex()
            sage: K1 == K2
            True

        Things get more complicated for non-complete fans::
