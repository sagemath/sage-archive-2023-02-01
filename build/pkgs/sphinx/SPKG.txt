== Description ==

Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and
beautiful documentation for Python projects (or other documents
consisting of multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg
Brandl. It was originally created to translate the new Python
documentation, but has now been cleaned up in the hope that it will be
useful to many other projects.
