Elliptic curves with prescribed good reduction

Construction of elliptic curves with good reduction outside a finite
set of primes

A theorem of Shafarevich states that, over a number field `K`, given
any finite set `S` of primes of `K`, there are (up to isomorphism)
only a finite set of elliptic curves defined over `K` with good
reduction at all primes outside `S`.  An explicit form of the theorem
with an algorithm for finding this finite set was given in "Finding
all elliptic curves with good reduction outside a given set of primes"
by John Cremona and Mark Lingham, Experimental Mathematics 16 No.3
(2007), 303-312.  The method requires computation of the class and
unit groups of `K` as well as all the `S`-integral points on a
collection of auxiliary elliptic curves defined over `K`.

This implementation (April 2009) is only for the case `K=\QQ`, where in
many cases the determination of the necessary sets of `S`-integral
points is possible.  The main user-level function is
:func:`EllipticCurves_with_good_reduction_outside_S`, defined in
constructor.py.  Users should note carefully the following points:

(1) the number of auxiliary curves to be considered is exponential in
the size of `S` (specifically, `2.6^s` where `s=|S|`).

(2) For some of the auxiliary curves it is impossible at present to
provably find all the `S`-integral points using the current
algorithms, which rely on first finding a basis for their Mordell-Weil
groups using 2-descent.  A warning is output in cases where the set of
points (and hence the final output) is not guaranteed to be complete.
Using the ``proof=False`` flag suppresses these warnings.

EXAMPLES: We find all elliptic curves with good reduction outside 2,
listing the label of each::

    sage: [e.label() for e in EllipticCurves_with_good_reduction_outside_S([2])]  # long time (5s on sage.math, 2013)
    ['32a1',
    '32a2',
    '32a3',
    '32a4',
    '64a1',
    '64a2',
    '64a3',
    '64a4',
    '128a1',
    '128a2',
    '128b1',
    '128b2',
    '128c1',
    '128c2',
    '128d1',
    '128d2',
    '256a1',
    '256a2',
    '256b1',
    '256b2',
    '256c1',
    '256c2',
    '256d1',
    '256d2']

Secondly we try the same with `S={11}`; note that warning messages are
printed without ``proof=False`` (unless the optional database is
installed: two of the auxiliary curves whose Mordell-Weil bases are
required have conductors 13068 and 52272 so are in the database)::

    sage: [e.label() for e in EllipticCurves_with_good_reduction_outside_S([11], proof=False)]  # long time (13s on sage.math, 2011)
    ['11a1', '11a2', '11a3', '121a1', '121a2', '121b1', '121b2', '121c1', '121c2', '121d1', '121d2', '121d3']
