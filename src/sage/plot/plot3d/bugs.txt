Jmol bugs:

 * reloading a worksheet kills all jmol applets!  -- note if we get
   rid of jmolSetDocument(cell_writer) this doesn't happen; but then
   other things break.  Probably need to save the javascript and
   execute it each time we releoad.
 * Sphere(0.3,color="red").translate([1,1,-1]) has *holes* in it!!
 * (done) Default zoom is useless -- we will have to rescale the whole scene I think.
   Basically we have to figure out the true range of the 3d plot in each direction,
   then rescale everything into a 10x10x10 square.
   We should draw axis and allow for aspect ratios.
 * Invalid color doesn't yield an error message, e.g., Icosahedron(texture="yello")
 * color --> rgbcolor
 * In parametricsurface:
        except:       # TODO -- this would catch control-C,etc. -- FIX THIS TO CATCH WHAT IS RAISED!!!!
 * Observation:
      jmol embedded applets *crash* when more than 10 or so appear in
      a page... unless I make them all small (e.g. 50 pixels) in which
      case they DO NOT crash.

Jmol todo:

 * names should make sense (basically like in mathematica) and be lower case
     * for user exposed functions, (not necessarily for the classes)
 * Dynamic resizing in the notebook
 * Javascript controls in the notebook


Tachyon bugs:
 * Text3D doesn't work
