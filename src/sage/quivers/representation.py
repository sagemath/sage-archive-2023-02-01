Quiver Representations

AUTHORS:

- Jim Stark (2012-03-04): Initial implementation of acyclic quivers without
  relations.
- Simon King (2013-05, 2014-02): Split code up. Allow cyclic quivers where
  possible.

A quiver is a directed graph used for representation theory. In our
representation theoretic code, it is assumed that

- the vertices of the quiver are labelled by integers, and

- each edge of the quiver is labelled with a nonempty string.  The label
  cannot begin with ``'e_'`` or contain ``'*'`` and distinct edges must have
  distinct labels.

As far as the :class:`~sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph` class is concerned, a
path is a finite list of pairwise distinct vertices `v_1, ..., v_n` such
that there exists an edge from `v_i` to `v_{i + 1}`.  If there are
multiple edges between the same two vertices this does not contribute
additional paths as listed by the :class:`~sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph`
class; for example only two paths are listed from 1 to 3 in ``Q``::

    sage: Q = DiGraph({1:{2:['a','b'], 3:['c']}, 2:{3:['d']}})
    sage: Q.edges()
    [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 2, 'b'), (1, 3, 'c'), (2, 3, 'd')]
    sage: Q.all_paths(1, 3)
    [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3]]

The notion of a path in a quiver (in representation theory) is
fundamentally different in several aspects. First, paths are no longer
required to have distinct vertices, or even distinct edges; thus, "path"
in quiver theory is closer to the notion of "walk" in graph theory.
Furthermore, paths in quiver theory "know" their edges, so parallel edges
between the same two vertices of a Quiver make different paths. But
paths in quiver theory also "know" their vertices, so that a length-`0`
path from `a` to `a` is not the same as a length-`0` path from `b` to `b`
for `a \neq b`.
Formally, we say that a path is given by two vertices, ``start`` and
``end``, and a finite (possibly empty) list of edges `e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n`
such that the initial vertex of `e_1` is ``start``, the final vertex of `e_i`
is the initial vertex of `e_{i + 1}`, and the final vertex of `e_n` is
``end``.  In the case where no edges are specified, we must have
``start = end`` and the path is called the trivial path at the given vertex.

Quiver paths in the sense stated above correspond to the elements of a
partial semigroup, with multiplication of paths given by concatenation. Hence,
rather than overloading the method name inherited from
:class:`~sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph` or inventing a
new method name, we move this functionality to this so-called *path
semigroup*.  Note that with this definition there are three paths from 1 to 3
in our example::

    sage: Q.path_semigroup().all_paths(1, 3)
    [a*d, b*d, c]

The returned paths are of type :class:`~sage.quivers.paths.QuiverPath`, which
are elements in the path semigroup that is associated with the quiver (a
partial semigroup, which does not generally have a neutral element). You can
specify a :class:`~sage.quivers.paths.QuiverPath` by giving an edge or a
list of edges, passed as arguments to the path semigroup containing this path.
Here an edge is a tuple of the form ``(i, j, l)``, where ``i`` and ``j``
are vertices and ``l`` is the label of an edge from i to j::

    sage: p = Q.path_semigroup()([(1, 2, 'a'), (2, 3, 'd')])
    sage: p
    a*d

Trivial paths are indicated by passing the tuple ``(vertex, vertex)``::

    sage: Q.path_semigroup()((6, 6))
    e_6

Trivial "edges" can occur in the input.  They are simply deleted if their
vertex matches the start and end vertex of adjacent edges. Here is an
alternative way to define a path::

    sage: PQ = Q.path_semigroup()
    sage: q = PQ([(1, 1), (1, 2, 'a'), (2, 2), (2, 3, 'd'), (3, 3)])
    sage: p == q
    True

If the vertex of a trivial path does not match with adjacent edges, or if two
adjacent edges do not match, an error is raised.

::

    sage: inv1 = PQ([(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 1)])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Cannot interpret [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 1)] as element of
     Partial semigroup formed by the directed paths of Multi-digraph on 3 vertices
    sage: inv2 = PQ([(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 2, 'a')])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Cannot interpret [(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 2, 'a')] as element of
     Partial semigroup formed by the directed paths of Multi-digraph on 3 vertices
    sage: inv3 = PQ([(1, 2, 'x')])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Cannot interpret [(1, 2, 'x')] as element of
     Partial semigroup formed by the directed paths of Multi-digraph on 3 vertices

The ``*`` operator is concatenation of paths. If the two paths do not compose,
then the result is ``None`` (whence the "partial" in "partial semigroup").  ::

    sage: print p*q
    None

Let us now construct a larger quiver::

    sage: Qbig = DiGraph({1:{2:['a','b'], 3:['c']}, 2:{3:['d']}, 3:{4:['e']}, 4:{5:['f']}, 5:{1:['g']} })
    sage: Pbig = Qbig.path_semigroup()

Since ``Q`` is a sub-digraph of ``Qbig``, we have a coercion of the associated
path semigroups::

    sage: Pbig.has_coerce_map_from(PQ)
    True

In particular, ``p`` is considered to be an element of ``Pbig``, and can be
composed with paths that were defined for the larger quiver::

    sage: p in Pbig
    True
    sage: p*Pbig([(3, 4, 'e')])
    a*d*e
    sage: Pbig([(4, 5, 'f'), (5, 1, 'g')])*p
    f*g*a*d

The length of a path is the number of edges in that path::

    sage: len(p)
    2
    sage: triv = PQ((1, 1))
    sage: len(triv)
    0

List index and slice notation can be used to access the edges in a path.
QuiverPaths can also be iterated over.  Trivial paths have no elements::

    sage: for x in p: print x
    (1, 2, 'a')
    (2, 3, 'd')
    sage: triv[:]
    []

There are methods giving the initial and terminal vertex of a path::

    sage: p.initial_vertex()
    1
    sage: p.terminal_vertex()
    3

:class:`~sage.quivers.paths.QuiverPath` form the basis of the quiver
algebra of a quiver.  Given a field `k` and a quiver `Q`, the quiver
algebra `kQ` is, as a vector space, the free `k`-vector space whose basis
is the set of all paths in `Q`. Multiplication is defined on this basis
and extended bilinearly.  The product of two basis elements is given by
path composition when it makes sense and is set to be zero otherwise.
Specifically, if the terminal vertex of the left path equals the initial
vertex of the right path, then their product is the concatenation of the
two paths, and otherwise their product is zero. In sage, quiver algebras
are handled by the :class:`~sage.quivers.algebra.QuiverAlgebra` class::

    sage: A = PQ.algebra(GF(7))
    sage: A
    Path algebra of Multi-digraph on 3 vertices over Finite Field of size 7

Quivers have a method that creates their algebra over a given field (or,
more generally, commutative ring).  Note that
:class:`~sage.quivers.algebra.QuiverAlgebras` are uniquely defined by
their quiver and field, and play nicely with coercions of the underlying
path semigroups::

    sage: A is PQ.algebra(GF(7))
    True
    sage: A is PQ.algebra(RR)
    False
    sage: Q1 = Q.copy()
    sage: Q1.add_vertex(4)
    sage: PQ1 = Q1.path_semigroup()
    sage: A is PQ1.algebra(GF(7))
    False
    sage: Pbig.algebra(GF(7)).has_coerce_map_from(A)
    True

The :class:`~sage.quivers.algebra.QuiverAlgebra` can create elements
from :class:`~sage.quivers.paths.QuiverPaths` or from elements of the
base ring::

    sage: A(5)
    5*e_1 + 5*e_2 + 5*e_3
    sage: r = PQ([(1, 2, 'b'), (2, 3, 'd')])
    sage: e2 = PQ((2, 2))
    sage: x = A(p) + A(e2)
    sage: x
    e_2 + a*d
    sage: y = A(p) + A(r)
    sage: y
    a*d + b*d

:class:`~sage.quivers.algebra.QuiverAlgebras` are `\NN`-graded algebras.
The grading is given by assigning to each basis element the length of the
path corresponding to that basis element::

    sage: x.is_homogeneous()
    False
    sage: x.degree()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Element is not homogeneous.
    sage: y.is_homogeneous()
    True
    sage: y.degree()
    2
    sage: A[1]
    Free module spanned by [a, b, c, d] over Finite Field of size 7
    sage: A[2]
    Free module spanned by [a*d, b*d] over Finite Field of size 7

The category of right modules over a given quiver algebra is equivalent to the
category of representations of that quiver.  A quiver representation is a
diagram in the category of vector spaces whose underlying graph is the quiver.
So to each vertex of the quiver we assign a vector space and to each edge of
the quiver a linear map between the vector spaces assigned to the start and end
vertices of that edge.  To create the zero representation we just specify the
base ring and the path semigroup::

    sage: Z = Q1.path_semigroup().representation(GF(5))
    sage: Z.is_zero()
    True

To each vertex of a quiver there is associated a simple module, an
indecomposable projective, and an indecomposable injective, and these can
be created from the qQuiver::

    sage: S = PQ.S(GF(3), 1)
    sage: I = PQ.I(QQ, 2)
    sage: P = PQ.P(GF(3), 1)

Radicals, socles, tops, and quotients can all be computed and we can test if
modules are simple or semisimple, get their dimension, and test for equality.
Like quivers, :class:`~sage.quivers.representation.QuiverRep` objects
are unique and therefore equal if and only if they are identical::

    sage: P.is_simple()
    False
    sage: P.dimension()
    6
    sage: R = P.radical()
    sage: P.socle()
    Representation with dimension vector (0, 0, 3)
    sage: (P/R).is_simple()
    True
    sage: P == R
    False
    sage: P.top() is P/R
    True

There are special methods to deal with modules that are given as right
ideals in the quiver algebra.  To create such a module pass the keyword
``option='paths'`` along with a path or list of paths that generate the
desired ideal::

    sage: M = PQ.representation(QQ, [[(1, 1)], [(1, 2, 'a')]], option='paths')
    sage: M.dimension_vector()
    (1, 2, 3)

There are also special methods to deal with modules that are given as the
linear dual of a right ideal in the quiver algebra.  To create such a
module, pass the keyword ``option='dual paths'`` to the constructor along
with a path or list of paths.  The module returned is the dual of the
ideal created in the opposite quiver by the reverses of the given paths::

    sage: D = PQ.representation(QQ, [[(1, 1)], [(1, 2, 'a')]], option='dual paths')
    sage: D.dimension_vector()
    (2, 0, 0)

For modules that are not a standard module or an ideal of the quiver algebra
:class:`~sage.quivers.representation.QuiverRep` can take as input two
dictionaries.  The first associates to each vertex a vector space or an
integer (the desired dimension of the vector space), the second associates to
each edge a map or a matrix or something from which sage can construct a map::

    sage: PQ2 = DiGraph({1:{2:['a', 'b']}}).path_semigroup()
    sage: M2 = PQ2.representation(QQ, {1: QQ^2, 2: QQ^1}, {(1, 2, 'a'): [1, 0], (1, 2, 'b'): [0, 1]})
    sage: M.get_space(2)
    Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
    sage: M2.get_space(2)
    Vector space of dimension 1 over Rational Field
    sage: M.get_map((1, 2, 'a'))
    Vector space morphism represented by the matrix:
    [1 0]
    Domain: Vector space of dimension 1 over Rational Field
    Codomain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field

A homomorphism between two quiver representations is given by homomorphisms
between the spaces assigned to the vertices of those representations such that
those homomorphisms commute with the edge maps of the representations. The
homomorphisms are created in the usual Sage syntax, the defining data given by
a dictionary associating maps to vertices::

    sage: P2 = PQ2.P(QQ, 1)
    sage: f = P2.hom({1:[1, 1], 2:[[1], [1]]}, M2)

When the domain is given as a right ideal in the quiver algebra we can also
create a homomorphism by just giving a single element in the codomain.
The map is then induced by acting on that element::

    sage: x = P2.gens('x')[0]
    sage: x
    x_0
    sage: f == P2.hom(f(x), M2)
    True

As you can see, the above homomorphisms can be applied to elements.  Just
like elements, addition is defined via the ``+`` operator.  On elements scalar
multiplication is defined via the ``*`` operator but on homomorphisms ``*``
defines composition, so scalar multiplication is done using a method::

    sage: g = f + f
    sage: g == f.scalar_mult(2)
    True
    sage: g == 2*f       # This multiplies the map with the scalar 2
    True
    sage: g(x) == 2*f(x) # This applies the map, then multiplies by the scalar
    True

The ``direct_sum`` method for modules returns only the resulting module by
default.  But can also return the projection and inclusion homomorphisms into
the various factors::

    sage: N2, inclusions, projections = M2.direct_sum([P2], return_maps=True)
    sage: inclusions[0].domain() is M2
    True
    sage: projections[0].codomain() is M2
    True
    sage: (projections[0]*inclusions[0]).is_isomorphism()
    True

As you see above we can determine if a given map is an isomorphism.  Testing
for injectivity and surjectivity works as well::

    sage: f.is_injective()
    False
    sage: f.is_surjective()
    False

We can create all the standard modules associated to maps::

    sage: f.kernel()
    Representation with dimension vector (0, 1)
    sage: f.cokernel()
    Representation with dimension vector (1, 0)
    sage: im = f.image()
    sage: im
    Representation with dimension vector (1, 1)

These methods, as well as the ``submodule`` and ``quotient`` methods that are
defined for representations, return only the resulting representation.  To get
the inclusion map of a submodule or the factor homomorphism of a quotient use
``coerce_map_from``::

    sage: incl = M2.coerce_map_from(im)
    sage: incl.domain() is im
    True
    sage: incl.codomain() is M2
    True
    sage: incl.is_injective()
    True

Both :class:`~sage.quivers.representation.QuiverRep` objects and
:class:`~sage.quivers.homspace.QuiverRepHom` objects have ``linear_dual`` and
``algebraic_dual`` methods.  The ``linear_dual`` method applies the functor
`Hom_k(..., k)` where `k` is the base ring of the representation, and the
``algebraic_dual`` method applies the functor `Hom_Q(..., kQ)` where `kQ`
is the quiver algebra.  Both these functors yield left modules.  A left
module is equivalent to a right module over the opposite algebra, and the
opposite of a quiver algebra is the algebra of the opposite quiver, so both
these methods yield modules and representations of the opposite quiver::

    sage: f.linear_dual()
    Homomorphism of representations of Reverse of (): Multi-digraph on 2 vertices
    sage: D = M2.algebraic_dual()
    sage: D.quiver() is PQ2.reverse().quiver()
    True

.. TODO::

    Change the wording ``Reverse of ()`` into something more meaningful.

There is a method returning the projective cover of any module.  Note that
this method returns the homomorphism; to get the module take the domain of
the homomorphism::

    sage: cov = M2.projective_cover()
    sage: cov
    Homomorphism of representations of Multi-digraph on 2 vertices
    sage: cov.domain()
    Representation with dimension vector (2, 4)

As projective covers are computable, so are the transpose and Auslander-Reiten
translates of modules::

    sage: M2.transpose()
    Representation with dimension vector (4, 3)
    sage: PQ2.I(QQ, 1).AR_translate()
    Representation with dimension vector (3, 2)

We have already used the ``gens`` method above to get an element of a quiver
representation.  An element of a quiver representation is simply a choice of
element from each of the spaces assigned to the vertices of the quiver.
Addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication are performed pointwise and
implemented by the usual operators::

    sage: M2.dimension_vector()
    (2, 1)
    sage: x, y, z = M2.gens('xyz')
    sage: 2*x + y != x + 2*y
    True

To create a specific element of a given representation we just specify the
representation and a dictionary associating to each vertex an element of the
space associated to that vertex in the representation::

    sage: w = M2({1:(1, -1), 2:(3,)})
    sage: w.get_element(1)
    (1, -1)

The right action of a quiver algebra on an element is implemented via
the ``*`` operator::

    sage: A2 = x.quiver().path_semigroup().algebra(QQ)
    sage: a = A2((1, 2, 'a'))
    sage: x*a == z
    True

class QuiverRepFactory(UniqueFactory):
    r"""
    A quiver representation is a diagram in the category of vector spaces whose
    underlying graph is the quiver.  Giving a finite dimensional representation
    is equivalent to giving a finite dimensional right module for the path
    algebra of the quiver.

    INPUT:

    The first two arguments specify the base ring and the quiver,
    and they are always required:

    - ``k`` -- ring, the base ring of the representation

    - ``P`` -- the partial semigroup formed by the paths of the quiver of the
      representation

    Then to specify the spaces and maps associated to the quiver
    there are three possible options.  The first is the ``'values'`` option,
    where the next two arguments give the data to be assigned.  The following
    can either be the next two entries in the argument list or they can be
    passed by keyword.  If the argument list is long enough the keywords
    are ignored; the keywords are only checked in the event that the argument
    list does not have enough entries after ``P``.

    - ``spaces`` -- dict (default: empty); a dictionary associating to each
      vertex a free module over the base ring `k`.  Not all vertices must be
      specified; unspecified vertices are automatically set to `k^0`.  Keys
      of the dictionary  that don't correspond to vertices are ignored.

    - ``maps`` - dict (default: empty); a dictionary associating to each edge
      a map whose domain and codomain are the spaces associated to the initial
      and terminal vertex of the edge respectively.  Not all edges must be
      specified; unspecified edges are automatically set to the zero map.
      Keys of the dictionary that don't correspond to edges are ignored.

    The second option is the ``paths`` option which creates a module by
    generating a right ideal from a list of paths.  Thus the basis elements
    of this module correspond to paths of the quiver and the maps are given
    by right multiplication by the corresponding edge.  As above this can be
    passed either as the next entry in the argument list or as a keyword.
    The keyword is only checked if there is no entry in the argument list
    after ``Q``.

    - ``basis`` - list; a nonempty list of paths in the quiver ``Q``.
      Entries that do not represent valid paths are ignored and duplicate
      paths are deleted.  There must be at least one valid path in the list
      or a ``ValueError`` is raised.  The closure of this list under right
      multiplication forms the basis of the resulting representation.

    The third option is the ``dual paths`` option which creates the dual of
    a left ideal in the quiver algebra.  Thus the basis elements of this
    module correspond to paths of the quiver and the maps are given by
    deleting the corresponding edge from the start of the path (the edge map
    is zero on a path if that edge is not the initial edge of the path).
    As above this can be passed either as the next entry in the argument
    list or as a keyword.

    - ``basis`` -- list; a nonempty list of paths in the quiver ``Q``.
      Entries that do not represent valid paths are ignored and duplicate
      paths are deleted.  There must be at least one valid path in the list
      or a ``ValueError`` is raised.  The closure of this list under left
      multiplication of edges forms the basis of  the resulting representation.

    Using the second and third options requires that the following keyword be
    passed to the constructor.  This must be passed as a keyword.

    - ``option`` - string (default: ``None``), either ``'values'`` or
      ``'paths'`` or ``'dual paths'``. ``None`` is equivalent to ``'values'``.

    OUTPUT:

    - :class:`QuiverRep`

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: Q1 = DiGraph({1:{2:['a']}}).path_semigroup()

    When the ``option`` keyword is not supplied the constructor uses the
    ``'values'`` option and expects the spaces and maps to be specified.
    If no maps or spaces are given the zero module is created::

        sage: M = Q1.representation(GF(5))
        sage: M.is_zero()
        True

    The simple modules, indecomposable projectives, and indecomposable
    injectives are examples of quiver representations::

        sage: S = Q1.S(GF(3), 1)
        sage: I = Q1.I(QQ, 2)
        sage: P = Q1.P(GF(3), 1)

    Various standard submodules can be computed, such as radicals and socles.
    We can also form quotients and test for certain attributes such as
    semisimplicity::

        sage: R = P.radical()
        sage: R.is_zero()
        False
        sage: (P/R).is_simple()
        True
        sage: P == R
        False

    With the option ``'paths'`` the input data should be a list of
    :class:`QuiverPaths` or things that :class:`QuiverPaths` can be
    constructed from.  The resulting module is the submodule generated by
    these paths in the quiver algebra, when considered as a right module
    over itself::

        sage: P1 = Q1.representation(QQ, [[(1, 1)]], option='paths')
        sage: P1.dimension()
        2

    In the following example, the 3rd and 4th paths are actually the same,
    so the duplicate is removed::

        sage: N = Q1.representation(QQ, [[(1, 1)], [(2, 2)], [(1, 1), (1, 2, 'a'), (2, 2)], [(1, 2, 'a')]], option='paths')
        sage: N.dimension()
        3

    The dimension at each vertex equals the number of paths in the closed
    basis whose terminal point is that vertex::

        sage: Q2 = DiGraph({1:{2:['a'], 3:['b', 'c']}, 2:{3:['d']}}).path_semigroup()
        sage: M = Q2.representation(QQ, [[(2, 2)], [(1, 2, 'a')]], option='paths')
        sage: M.dimension_vector()
        (0, 2, 2)
        sage: N = Q2.representation(QQ, [[(2, 2)], [(1, 2, 'a'), (2, 3, 'd')]], option='paths')
        sage: N.dimension_vector()
        (0, 1, 2)
    """
    def create_key(self, k, P, *args, **kwds):
        """
        Return a key for the specified module.

        The key is a tuple.  The first and second entries are the base ring
        ``k`` and the partial semigroup ``P`` formed by the paths of a quiver.
        The third entry is the ``option`` and the remaining entries depend on
        that option.  If the option is ``'values'`` and the quiver

        to be assigned to those vertices.  After that are the matrices of
        the maps assigned to edges, listed in the same order that
        ``Q.edges()`` uses.  If the option is ``'paths'`` or ``'dual paths'``

##  Elements

class QuiverRepElement(ModuleElement):
    r"""
    An element of a quiver representation is a choice of element from each
    of the spaces assigned to the vertices of the quiver.  Addition,
    subtraction, and scalar multiplication of these elements is done
    pointwise within these spaces.

    INPUT:

    - ``module`` -- :class:`QuiverRep` (default: ``None``), the module to
      which the element belongs

    - ``elements`` - dict (default: empty), a dictionary associating to each
      vertex a vector or an object from which sage can create a vector.
      Not all vertices must be specified, unspecified vertices will be
      assigned the zero vector of the space associated to that vertex in
      the given module.  Keys that do not correspond to a vertex are ignored.

    - ``name`` -- string (default: ``None``), the name of the element

    OUTPUT:

    - :class:`QuiverRepElement`

    .. NOTE::

        The constructor needs to know the quiver in order to create an
        element of a representation over that quiver.  The default is to
        read this information from ``module`` as well as to fill in
        unspecified vectors with the zeros of the spaces in ``module``.
        If ``module`` is ``None`` then ``quiver`` *MUST* be a quiver and each
        vertex *MUST* be specified or an error will result.  If both
        ``module`` and ``quiver`` are given then ``quiver`` is ignored.

        The sum of all trivial paths is the identity element under
        this action::

            sage: x + y + z == v
            True

        Note that the action only depends on the element of the path algebra
        that the input specifies::

            sage: a = M.left_edge_action([(1, 1), (1, 2, 'a'), (2, 2)], v) # indirect doctest
            sage: b = M.left_edge_action((1, 2, 'a'), v) # indirect doctest
            sage: a == b
            True

        These two edges multiply to zero in the path algebra::

            sage: M.left_edge_action([(1, 2, 'a'), (1, 2, 'b')], v).is_zero() # indirect doctest

        Test whether the basis is closed under left multiplication.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: Q1 = DiGraph({1:{2:['a']}}).path_semigroup()
            sage: P2 = Q1.representation(QQ, [[(2, 2)]], option='paths')
            sage: P2.is_left_module()

        The supplied basis is not closed under left multiplication, but it's
        not closed under right multiplication either.  When the closure under
        right multiplication is taken the result is also closed under left
        multiplication and therefore produces a left module structure::

        Taking the right closure of a left closed set produces another
        left closed set::

        Note that the second path is length 2, so even though the edge (1, 2, 'a')
        appears in the input the path [(1, 2, 'a')] is not in the right closure::

            sage: N = Q2.representation(QQ, [[(2, 2)], [(1, 2, 'a'), (2, 3, 'd')]], option='paths')

    The basis of the module must be closed under left deletion of an edge; that
    is, deleting any edge from the beginning of any path in the basis must
    result in a path also contained in the basis of the module.

    INPUT:

    - ``k`` -- ring; the base ring of the representation

    - ``P`` -- the path semigroup of the quiver `Q` of the representation

    - ``basis`` -- list (default: empty); should be a list of paths (also
      lists) in the quiver `Q`.  Entries that do not represent valid paths
      are ignored and duplicate paths are deleted.  The closure of this
      list under left deletion forms the basis of the resulting
      representation.
