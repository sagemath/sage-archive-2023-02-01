Static Sparse Graphs

What is the point ?
-------------------

This class implements a Cython (di)graph structure made for efficiency. The
graphs are *static*, i.e. no add/remove vertex/edges methods are available, nor
can they easily or efficiently be implemented within this data structure.

The data structure, however, is made to save the maximum amount of computations
for graph algorithms whose main operation is to *list the out-neighbours of a
vertex* (which is precisely what BFS, DFS, distance computations and the
flow-related stuff waste their life on).

The code contained in this module is written C-style. The purpose is efficiency
and simplicity.

For an overview of graph data structures in sage, see
:mod:`~sage.graphs.base.overview`.

Data structure
--------------

.. image:: ../../../media/structure.png

The data structure is actually pretty simple and compact. ``short_digraph`` has
five fields

- ``n`` (``int``); the number of vertices in the graph

- ``m`` (``int``); the number of edges in the graph

- ``edges`` (``uint32_t *``); array whose length is the number of edges of the
  graph

- ``neighbors`` (``uint32_t **``); this array has size `n+1`, and describes how
  the data of ``edges`` should be read : the neighbors of vertex `i` are the
  elements of ``edges`` addressed by ``neighbors[i]...neighbors[i+1]-1``. The
  element ``neighbors[n]``, which corresponds to no vertex (they are numbered
  from `0` to `n-1`) is present so that it remains easy to enumerate the
  neighbors of vertex `n-1` : the last of them is the element addressed by
  ``neighbors[n]-1``.

- ``edge_labels`` (``list``); this cython list associates a label to each edge
  of the graph. If a given edge is represented by ``edges[i]``, this its
  associated label can be found at ``edge_labels[i]``. This object is usually
  NULL, unless the call to ``init_short_digraph`` explicitly requires the labels
  to be stored in the data structure.

In the example given above, vertex 0 has 2,3,5,7,8 and 9 as out-neighbors, but
not 4, which is an out-neighbour of vertex 1. Vertex `n-1` has 2, 5, 8 and 9 as
out-neighbors. ``neighbors[n]`` points toward the cell immediately *after* the
end of ``edges``, hence *outside of the allocated memory*. It is used to
indicate the end of the outneighbors of vertex `n-1`

**Iterating over the edges**

This is *the one thing* to have in mind when working with this data structure::

    cdef list_edges(short_digraph g):
        cdef int i, j
        for i in range(g.n):
            for j in range(g.neighbors[i+1]-g.neighbors[i]):
                print("There is an edge from {} to {}".format(i, g.neighbors[i][j]))

**Advantages**

Two great points :

- The neighbors of a vertex are C types, and are contiguous in memory.
- Storing such graphs is incredibly cheaper than storing Python structures.

Well, I think it would be hard to have anything more efficient than that to
enumerate out-neighbors in sparse graphs ! :-)

Technical details
-----------------

* When creating a ``short_digraph`` from a ``Graph`` or ``DiGraph`` named ``G``,
  the `i^{\text{th}}` vertex corresponds *by default* to ``G.vertices()[i]``.
  Using optional parameter ``vertex_list``, you can specify the order of the
  vertices. Then `i^{\text{th}}` vertex will corresponds to ``vertex_list[i]``.

* Some methods return ``bitset_t`` objects when lists could be expected. There
  is a very useful ``bitset_list`` function for this kind of problems :-)

* When the edges are labelled, most of the space taken by this graph is taken by
  edge labels. If no edge is labelled then this space is not allocated, but if
  *any* edge has a label then a (possibly empty) label is stored for each edge,
  which can double the memory needs.

* The data structure stores the number of edges, even though it appears that
  this number can be reconstructed with ``g.neighbors[n]-g.neighbors[0]``. The
  trick is that not all elements of the ``g.edges`` array are necessarily used :
  when an undirected graph contains loops, only one entry of the array of size
  `2m` is used to store it, instead of the expected two. Storing the number of
  edges is the only way to avoid an uselessly costly computation to obtain the
  number of edges of an undirected, looped, AND labelled graph (think of several
  loops on the same vertex with different labels).

* The codes of this module are well documented, and many answers can be found
  directly in the code.

Cython functions

    :class: contentstable
    :widths: 30, 70
    :delim: |

    ``init_short_digraph(short_digraph g, G)`` | Initialize ``short_digraph g`` from a Sage (Di)Graph.
    ``int n_edges(short_digraph g)`` | Return the number of edges in ``g``
    ``int out_degree(short_digraph g, int i)`` | Return the out-degree of vertex `i` in ``g``
    ``has_edge(short_digraph g, int u, int v)`` | Test the existence of an edge.
    ``edge_label(short_digraph g, int * edge)`` | Return the label associated with a given edge
    ``init_empty_copy(short_digraph dst, short_digraph src)`` | Allocate ``dst`` so that it can contain as many vertices and edges as ``src``.
    ``init_reverse(short_digraph dst, short_digraph src)`` | Initialize ``dst`` to a copy of ``src`` with all edges in the opposite direction.
    ``free_short_digraph(short_digraph g)`` | Free the resources used by ``g``

**Connectivity**

``can_be_reached_from(short_digraph g, int src, bitset_t reached)``

    Assuming ``bitset_t reached`` has size at least ``g.n``, this method updates
    ``reached`` so that it represents the set of vertices that can be reached
    from ``src`` in ``g``.

``strongly_connected_component_containing_vertex(short_digraph g, short_digraph g_reversed, int v, bitset_t scc)``

    Assuming ``bitset_t reached`` has size at least ``g.n``, this method updates
    ``scc`` so that it represents the vertices of the strongly connected
    component containing ``v`` in ``g``. The variable ``g_reversed`` is assumed
    to represent the reverse of ``g``.

``tarjan_strongly_connected_components_C(short_digraph g, int *scc)``

    Assuming ``scc`` is already allocated and has size at least ``g.n``, this
    method computes the strongly connected components of ``g``, and outputs in
    ``scc[v]`` the number of the strongly connected component containing ``v``.
    It returns the number of strongly connected components.

``strongly_connected_components_digraph_C(short_digraph g, int nscc, int *scc, short_digraph output):``

    Assuming ``nscc`` and ``scc`` are the outputs of
    ``tarjan_strongly_connected_components_C`` on ``g``, this routine
    sets ``output`` to the
    strongly connected component digraph of ``g``, that is, the vertices of
    ``output`` are the strongly connected components of ``g`` (numbers are
    provided by ``scc``), and ``output`` contains an arc ``(C1,C2)`` if ``g``
    has an arc from a vertex in ``C1`` to a vertex in ``C2``.

What is this module used for ?
------------------------------

It is for instance used in the :mod:`sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs` module,
and in the :meth:`~sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph.strongly_connected_components`
method.

Python functions
----------------

These functions are available so that Python modules from Sage can call the
Cython routines this module implements (as they cannot directly call methods
with C arguments).

    r"""
    The Tarjan algorithm to compute strongly connected components (SCCs).

    This routine returns the number of SCCs `k` and, stores in ``scc[v]`` an
    integer between `0` and `k-1`, corresponding to the SCC containing v. SCCs
    are numbered in reverse topological order, that is, if `(v,w)` is an edge
    in the graph, ``scc[v] <= scc[w]``.

    The basic idea of the algorithm is this: a depth-first search (DFS) begins
    from an arbitrary start node (and subsequent DFSes are
    conducted on any nodes that have not yet been found). As usual with DFSes,
    the search visits every node of the graph exactly once, declining to revisit
    any node that has already been explored. Thus, the collection of search
    trees is a spanning forest of the graph. The strongly connected components
    are the subtrees of this spanning forest having no edge directed outside the
    subtree.

def tarjan_strongly_connected_components(G):
    r"""
    Return the lists of vertices in each strongly connected components (SCCs).

    This method implements the Tarjan algorithm to compute the strongly
    connected components of the digraph. It returns a list of lists of vertices,
    each list of vertices representing a strongly connected component.

    The basic idea of the algorithm is this: a depth-first search (DFS) begins
    from an arbitrary start node (and subsequent DFSes are
    conducted on any nodes that have not yet been found). As usual with DFSes,
    the search visits every node of the graph exactly once, declining to revisit
    any node that has already been explored. Thus, the collection of search
    trees is a spanning forest of the graph. The strongly connected components
    correspond to the subtrees of this spanning forest that have no edge
    directed outside the subtree.

    To recover these components, during the DFS, we keep the index of a node,
    that is, the position in the DFS tree, and the lowlink: as soon as the
    subtree rooted at `v` has been fully explored, the lowlink of `v` is the
    smallest index reachable from `v` passing from descendants of `v`. If the
    subtree rooted at `v` has been fully explored, and the index of `v` equals
    the lowlink of `v`, that whole subtree is a new SCC.

    :wikipedia:`Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm`.

    INPUT:

    - ``prec`` -- (default ``1e-10``) an upper bound for the relative precision
      of the interval

    The algorithm is iterative and uses an inequality valid for non-negative
    matrices. Namely, if `A` is a non-negative square matrix with
    Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue `\lambda` then the following inequality is valid
    for any vector `x`

    .. MATH::

        \min_i  \frac{(Ax)_i}{x_i} \leq \lambda \leq \max_i \frac{(Ax)_i}{x_i}

    .. NOTE::

        The speed of convergence of the algorithm is governed by the spectral
        gap (the distance to the second largest modulus of other eigenvalues).
        If this gap is small, then this function might not be appropriate.

        The algorithm is not smart and not parallel! It uses basic interval
        arithmetic and native floating point arithmetic.
