topcom: Compute triangulations of point configurations and oriented matroids
============================================================================

Description
-----------

TOPCOM is a collection of clients to compute Triangulations Of Point
Configurations and Oriented Matroids, resp.

The algorithms use only combinatorial data of the point configuration as
is given by its oriented matroid. Some basic commands for computing and
manipulating oriented matroids can also be accessed by the user.

It was very much inspired by the maple program PUNTOS, which was written
by Jesus de Loera. TOPCOM is entirely written in C++, so there is a
significant speed up compared to PUNTOS.
