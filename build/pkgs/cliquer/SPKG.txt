= Cliquer =

== Description ==
Cliquer is a set of C routines for finding cliques in an arbitrary
weighted graph. It uses an exact branch-and-bound algorithm recently
developed by Patr Ostergard.

== License ==
Cliquer is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 ( June 1991 )

== SPKG Maintainers ==
Nathann Cohen (nathann.cohen@gmail.com)

== Upstream Contact ==
Cliquer was mainly written by Sampo Niskanen, sampo.niskanenQiki.fi (Q=@).
http://users.tkk.fi/pat/cliquer.html

== Dependencies ==
 * None

== TODO ==
 * A MAJOR cleanup of this package is required, see #9870, #14349

== Patches ==
 * Makefile.patch: Patch the Makefile for Sage. This custom Makefile
   contains Sage specific compilation and linking flags. More
   importantly, we're building cliquer as a dynamic shared library,
   instead of a stand alone program.
 * cl_c.patch, cl_h.patch: Hook into cliquer to access internal
   functions. Could probably be done better (see TODO)

== Changelog ==

=== cliquer-1.21.p1 (Volker Braun, Felix Salfelder, 15 July 2013) ===
 * Trac #14892: Track all patches, remove unnecessary graph.c.patch

=== cliquer-1.21.p0 (Nathann Cohen, 4 May 2012) ===
 * Solved memory leaks reported on #12905
 * Incidentally updated Cliquer to version 1.21
 * Incidentally removed Sage's code that was formerly directly
   inserted in the original files. This code is now inserted during
   installation from patches located in the patches/ folder. A bit
   cleaner. A long way to go. But God this code really is messy and
   full of global variables.

=== cliquer-1.2.p11 (John Palmieri, 23 March 2012) ===
 * #12311: Remove explicit path to testcc.sh in spkg-install.

=== cliquer-1.2.p10 (Karl-Dieter Crisman, 28 June 2011) ===
 * #11547: Make sure that libcliquer.so is copied as both
   .dll and .so files on Cygwin

=== cliquer-1.2.p9 (Jeroen Demeyer, 4 May 2011) ===
 * #11227: Apply workaround also for versions 4.6.1 of gcc, not only
   version 4.6.0.  This is to support pre-release versions of
   gcc 4.6.1, the bug should be fixed in the final gcc 4.6.1.

=== cliquer-1.2.p8 (Jeroen Demeyer, 25 April 2011) ===
 * #11227: When compiling with gcc 4.6.0, add compiler flag -fno-ivopts
   to work around a gcc bug.
 * Use `patch` for patching the Makefile and put patches/Makefile.patch
   under hg control.
 * Some minor cleanup of spkg-install and Makefile.

=== cliquer-1.2.p7 David Kirkby, Leif Leonhardy  (14 September 2010) ===
 * #9871 Change flags passed to the linker on Solaris to avoid problems with the
   link-editor believing the shared library contains text relocations. This
   problem can be seen on 32-bit builds of Solaris and OpenSolaris using
   /usr/bin/elfdump, but the problems are much more serious on 64-bit
   builds of Solaris - in some cases stopping code from building.
 * Added the linker flag -ztext on Solaris too, as -ztest forces a fatal
   error if any  relocations   against   non-writable,  allocatable  sections
   remain. This will make it easier to catch any similar bugs in future.

=== cliquer-1.2.p6 Nathann Cohen, David Kirkby (31 August 2010) ===
 * #9766: Additions to SPKG.txt
      - URL of the original website to the SPKG.txt file
      - "Special Update/Build Instructions" section
      - "Dependencies" section
 * Added an entry to SPKG showing when this package was first put into
   Sage. The first mercurial log is dated 17th July 2009.
 * Added a note on to the cliquer-1.2.p0 entry in SPKG.txt that 'scons'
   was no longer used.

=== cliquer-1.2.p5 Mike Hansen (15 February 2010) ===
 * Fixed Trac #8279 to make the cliquer spkg work on Cygwin with the Sage library.

=== cliquer-1.2.p4 Mike Hansen, William Stein (12 February 2010) ===
 * Fixed Trac #7308 to make the cliquer spkg work on Cygwin.

=== cliquer-1.2.p3 (Peter Jeremy, 2010-01-25) ===
 * #7824: add FreeBSD support

=== cliquer-1.2.p2 (?, ?) ===
 * changelog lost to history

=== cliquer-1.2.p1 Karl-Dieter Crisman, Georg S. Weber (7th October 2009) ===
 * fix trac #7115: Re-add support for building cliquer on Mac OS X 10.4

=== cliquer-1.2.p0 Minh Van Nguyen (16th September 2009) ===
 * Support for building cliquer 1.2 in 64-bit mode on Mac OS X 10.5.x
   and 64-bit openSUSE 11.1.
 * Add custom compilation and linking flags on top of the Makefile of
   cliquer 1.2.
 * Removed dependancy of cliquer on 'scons'

=== cliquer-1.2 Nathann Cohen (17th July 2009) ===
 * First release put into Sage.
