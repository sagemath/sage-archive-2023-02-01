    #. Take two disjoint copies of a :meth:`Petersen graph

    #. Subdivide all the edges once, to create 15+15=30 new vertices, which
       together form another orbit.

    #. Create 15 vertices, each of them linked to 2 corresponding vertices of
       the previous orbit, one in each of the two subdivided Petersen graphs. At
       the end of this step all vertices from the previous orbit have degree 3,
       and the only vertices of degree 2 in the graph are those that were just
       created.

    Return the Harries-Wong Graph.

    See the :wikipedia:`Harries-Wong_graph`.

    *About the default embedding:*

    The default embedding is an attempt to emphasize the graph's 8 (!!!)
    different orbits. In order to understand this better, one can picture the
    graph as being built in the following way.

    #. One first creates a 3-dimensional cube (8 vertices, 12 edges),
       whose vertices define the first orbit of the final graph.

    #. The edges of this graph are subdivided once, to create 12 new vertices
       which define a second orbit.

    #. The edges of the graph are subdivided once more, to create 24 new
       vertices giving a third orbit.

    #. 4 vertices are created and made adjacent to the vertices of the second
       orbit so that they have degree 3. These 4 vertices also define a new
       orbit.

    #. In order to make the vertices from the third orbit 3-regular (they all
       miss one edge), one creates a binary tree on 1 + 3 + 6 + 12 vertices. The
       leaves of this new tree are made adjacent to the 12 vertices of the third
       orbit, and the graph is now 3-regular. This binary tree contributes 4 new
       orbits to the Harries-Wong graph.

    Return the Wells graph.

    For more information on the Wells graph (also called Armanios-Wells graph),
    see `this page <https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/Wells.html>`_.

    The implementation follows the construction given on page 266 of [BCN1989]_.
    This requires to create intermediate graphs and run a small isomorphism
    test, while everything could be replaced by a pre-computed list of edges.
    I believe that it is better to keep "the recipe" in the code, however, as it
    is quite unlikely that this could become the most time-consuming operation
    in any sensible algorithm, and .... "preserves knowledge", which is what
    open-source software is meant to do.

    INPUT:

    - ``from_string`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to build the graph
      from its sparse6 string or through GAP. The two methods return the same
      graph though doing it through GAP takes more time.

    Return the Balaban 10-cage.

    The Balaban 10-cage is a 3-regular graph with 70 vertices and 105 edges. See
    the :wikipedia:`Balaban_10-cage`.

    The default embedding gives a deeper understanding of the graph's
    automorphism group. It is divided into 4 layers (each layer being a set of
    points at equal distance from the drawing's center). From outside to inside:

    - L1: The outer layer (vertices which are the furthest from the origin) is
      actually the disjoint union of two cycles of length 10.

    - L2: The second layer is an independent set of 20 vertices.

    - L3: The third layer is a matching on 10 vertices.

    - L4: The inner layer (vertices which are the closest from the origin) is
      also the disjoint union of two cycles of length 10.

    This graph is not vertex-transitive, and its vertices are partitioned into 3
    orbits: L2, L3, and the union of L1 of L4 whose elements are equivalent.

    INPUT:

    - ``embedding`` -- integer (default: ``1``); two embeddings are available,

    Return the Balaban 11-cage.

    For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Balaban_11-cage`.

    INPUT:

    - ``embedding`` -- integer (default: ``1``); three embeddings are available,
      and can be selected by setting ``embedding`` to be 1, 2, or 3

      - The first embedding is the one appearing on page 9 of the Fifth Annual
        Graph Drawing Contest report [EMMN1998]_. It separates vertices based on
        their eccentricity (see :meth:`eccentricity()
        <sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.eccentricity>`).

      - The second embedding has been produced just for Sage and is meant to
        emphasize the automorphism group's 6 orbits.

      - The last embedding is the default one produced by the :meth:`LCFGraph`
        constructor.

    .. NOTE::

        The vertex labeling changes according to the value of ``embedding=1``.

def HigmanSimsGraph(relabel=True):
    r"""
    Return the Higman-Sims graph.

    The Higman-Sims graph is a remarkable strongly regular graph of degree 22 on
    100 vertices.  For example, it can be split into two sets of 50 vertices
    each, so that each half induces a subgraph isomorphic to the
    Hoffman-Singleton graph (:meth:`~HoffmanSingletonGraph`). This can be done
    in 352 ways (see `Higman-Sims graph
    <https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/Higman-Sims.html>`_ by Andries
    E. Brouwer, accessed 24 October 2009.)

    Its most famous property is that the automorphism group has an index 2
    subgroup which is one of the 26 sporadic groups [HS1968]_.

    The construction used here follows [Haf2004]_.

    See also the :wikipedia:`Higman–Sims_graph`.

    INPUT:

    - ``relabel`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to relabel the
      vertices with consecutive integers. If ``False`` the labels are strings
      that are three digits long. "xyz" means the vertex is in group `x` (zero
      through three), pentagon or pentagram `y` (zero through four), and is
      vertex `z` (zero through four) of that pentagon or pentagram. See
      [Haf2004]_ for more.

    OUTPUT:

    The Higman-Sims graph.

    EXAMPLES:

    A split into the first 50 and last 50 vertices will induce two copies of the
    Hoffman-Singleton graph, and we illustrate another such split, which is
    obvious based on the construction used::

        sage: H = graphs.HigmanSimsGraph()
        sage: A = H.subgraph(range(0,50))
        sage: B = H.subgraph(range(50,100))
        sage: K = graphs.HoffmanSingletonGraph()
        sage: K.is_isomorphic(A) and K.is_isomorphic(B)

        sage: K.is_isomorphic(C) and K.is_isomorphic(D)
        True

    The automorphism group contains only one nontrivial proper normal subgroup,
    which is of index 2 and is simple.  It is known as the Higman-Sims group::

        sage: H = graphs.HigmanSimsGraph()
        sage: G = H.automorphism_group()
        sage: g=G.order(); g
        88704000

def HoffmanSingletonGraph():
    r"""
    Return the Hoffman-Singleton graph.

    The Hoffman-Singleton graph is the Moore graph of degree 7, diameter 2 and
    girth 5. The Hoffman-Singleton theorem states that any Moore graph with
    girth 5 must have degree 2, 3, 7 or 57. The first three respectively are the
    pentagon, the Petersen graph, and the Hoffman-Singleton graph. The existence
    of a Moore graph with girth 5 and degree 57 is still open.

    A Moore graph is a graph with diameter `d` and girth `2d + 1`. This implies
    that the graph is regular, and distance regular.

    For more details, see [GR2001]_ and the
    :wikipedia:`Hoffman–Singleton_graph`.

    PLOTTING: Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
    the spring-layout algorithm. A novel algorithm written by Tom Boothby gives
    a random layout which is pleasing to the eye.

def KrackhardtKiteGraph():
    """
    Return a Krackhardt kite graph with 10 nodes.

    The Krackhardt kite graph was originally developed by David Krackhardt for
    the purpose of studying social networks (see [Kre2002]_ and
    the :wikipedia:`Krackhardt_kite_graph`). It is used to show the distinction
    between degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness
    centrality. For more information read the plotting section below in
    conjunction with the example.

    PLOTTING: Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
    the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, the graph is drawn left to
    right, in top to bottom row sequence of [2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1] nodes on each
    row. This places the fourth node (3) in the center of the kite, with the
    highest degree. But the fourth node only connects nodes that are otherwise
    connected, or those in its clique (i.e.: Degree Centrality). The eighth (7)
    node is where the kite meets the tail. It has degree = 3, less than the
    average, but is the only connection between the kite and tail (i.e.:
    Betweenness Centrality). The sixth and seventh nodes (5 and 6) are drawn in
    the third row and have degree = 5. These nodes have the shortest path to all
    other nodes in the graph (i.e.: Closeness Centrality).  Please execute the
    example for visualization.

def IoninKharaghani765Graph():
    r"""
    Return a `(765, 192, 48, 48)`-strongly regular graph.

    Existence of a strongly regular graph with these parameters was claimed in
    [IK2003]_.  Implementing the construction in the latter did not work,
    however. This function implements the following instructions, shared by Yury
    Ionin and Hadi Kharaghani.

        Let `A` be the affine plane over the field `GF(3)=\{-1,0,1\}`. Let

        .. MATH::

            \phi_1(x,y) &= x\\
            \phi_2(x,y) &= y\\
            \phi_3(x,y) &= x+y\\
            \phi_4(x,y) &= x-y\\

        For `i=1,2,3,4` and `j\in GF(3)`, let `L_{i,j}` be the line in `A`
        defined by `\phi_i(x,y)=j`. Let `\mathcal M` be the set of all 12 lines
        `L_{i,j}`, plus the empty set. Let `\pi` be the permutation defined on
        `\mathcal M` by `\pi(L_{i,j}) = L_{i,j+1}` and `\pi(\emptyset) =
        \emptyset`, so that `\pi` has three orbits of cardinality 3 and one of
        cardinality 1.

        Let `A=(p_1,...,p_9)` with `p_1=(-1,1)`, `p_2=(-1,0)`, `p_3=(-1,1)`,
        `p_4=(0,-1)`, `p_5=(0,0)`, `p_6=(0,1)`, `p_7=(1,-1)`, `p_8=(1,0)`,
        `p_9=(1,1)`. Note that `p_i+p_{10-i}=(0,0)`. For any subset `X` of `A`,
        let `M(X)` be the `(0,1)`-matrix of order 9 whose `(i,j)`-entry equals 1
        if and only if `p_{10-i}-p_j\in X`. Note that `M` is a symmetric matrix.

        An `MF`-tuple is an ordered quintuple `(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5)` of
        subsets of `A`, of which one is the empty set and the other four are
        pairwise non-parallel lines. Such a quintuple generates the following
        block matrix:

        .. MATH::

            N(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5) = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
                M(X_1) & M(X_2) & M(X_3) & M(X_4) & M(X_5)\\
                M(X_2) & M(X_3) & M(X_4) & M(X_5) & M(X_1)\\
                M(X_3) & M(X_4) & M(X_5) & M(X_1) & M(X_2)\\
                M(X_4) & M(X_5) & M(X_1) & M(X_2) & M(X_3)\\
                M(X_5) & M(X_1) & M(X_2) & M(X_3) & M(X_4)
                \end{array}\right)

        Observe that if `(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5)` is an `MF`-tuple, then
        `N(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5)` is the symmetric incidence matrix of a
        symmetric `(45, 12, 3)`-design.

        Let `\mathcal F` be the set of all `MF`-tuples and let `\sigma` be the
        following permutation of `\mathcal F`:

        .. MATH::

            \sigma(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5) & = (X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5, X_1)\\
            \pi(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5) & = (\pi(X_1), \pi(X_2), \pi(X_3), \pi(X_4), \pi(X_5))\\

        Observe that `\sigma` and `\pi` commute, and generate a (cyclic) group
        `G` of order 15. We will from now on identify `G` with the (cyclic)
        multiplicative group of the field `GF(16)` equal to
        `\{\omega^0,...,\omega^{14}\}`. Let `W=[w_{ij}]` be the following matrix
        of order 17 over `GF(16)=\{a_1,...,a_16\}`:

        .. MATH::

            w_{ij}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                a_i+a_j & \text{if }1\leq i\leq 16, 1\leq j\leq 16,\\
                1       & \text{if }i=17, j\neq 17,\\
                1       & \text{if }i\neq 17, j= 17,\\
                0       & \text{if }i=j=17
                \end{array}\right.

        The diagonal entries of `W` are equal to 0, each off-diagonal entry can
        be represented as `\omega^k` with `0\leq k\leq 14`. Matrix `W` is a
        symmetric `BGW(17,16,15; G)`.

        Fix an `MF`-tuple `(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5)` and let `S` be the block
        matrix obtained from `W` by replacing every diagonal entry of `W` by the
        zero matrix of order 45, and every off-diagonal entry `\omega^k` by the
        matrix `N(\sigma^k(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5))` (through the association
        of `\omega^k` with an element of `G`). Then `S` is a symmetric incidence
        matrix of a symmetric `(765, 192, 48)`-design with zero diagonal, and
        therefore `S` is an adjacency matrix of a strongly regular graph with
        parameters `(765, 192, 48, 48)`.
