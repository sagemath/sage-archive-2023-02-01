Affine curves.

EXAMPLES:

We can construct curves in either an affine plane::

    sage: A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(QQ, 2)
    sage: C = Curve([y - x^2], A); C
    Affine Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by -x^2 + y

or in higher dimensional affine space::

    sage: A.<x,y,z,w> = AffineSpace(QQ, 4)
    sage: C = Curve([y - x^2, z - w^3, w - y^4], A); C
    Affine Curve over Rational Field defined by -x^2 + y, -w^3 + z, -y^4 + w

    def resolution_of_singularities(self, extend=False):
        r"""
        Return a nonsingular model for this affine curve created by blowing up its singular points.

        The nonsingular model is given as a collection of affine patches that cover it. If ``extend`` is ``False``
        and if the base field is a number field, or if the base field is a finite field, the model returned may have
        singularities with coordinates not contained in the base field. An error is returned if this curve is already
        nonsingular, or if it has no singular points over its base field. This curve must be irreducible, and must be
        defined over a number field or finite field.

        INPUT:

        - ``extend`` -- (default: False) specifies whether to extend the base field when necessary to find all
          singular points when this curve is defined over a number field. If ``extend`` is ``False``, then only
          singularities with coordinates in the base field of this curve will be resolved. However, setting
          ``extend`` to ``True`` will slow down computations.

        OUTPUT:

        - a tuple consisting of three elements. The first is a tuple of curves in affine space of
          the same dimension as the ambient space of this curve, which represent affine patches
          of the resolution of singularities. The second is a tuple of tuples such that the jth
          element of the ith tuple is the transition map from the ith patch to the jth patch. Lastly,
          the third element is a tuple consisting of birational maps from the patches back to the
          original curve that were created by composing the projection maps generated from the blow up
          computations. There the ith element will be a map from the ith patch.
