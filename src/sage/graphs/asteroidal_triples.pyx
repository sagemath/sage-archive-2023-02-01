Definition
----------

Three independent vertices of a graph form an *asteroidal triple* if every two
of them are connected by a path avoiding the neighborhood of the third one. A
graph is *asteroidal triple-free* (*AT-free*, for short) if it contains no
asteroidal triple [LB62]_.

Use ``graph_classes.AT_free.description()`` to get some known properties of
AT-free graphs, or visit `this page
<http://www.graphclasses.org/classes/gc_61.html>`_.


Algorithm
---------

This module implements the  *Straightforward algorithm* recalled in [Koh04]_ and
due to [LB62]_ for testing if a graph is AT-free or not. This algorithm has time
complexity in `O(n^3)` and space complexity in `O(n^2)`.

This algorithm uses the *connected structure* of the graph, stored into a
`n\times n` matrix `M`. This matrix is such that `M[u][v]==0` if `v\in
(\{u\}\cup N(u))`, and otherwise `M[u][v]` is the unique identifier (a strictly
positive integer) of the connected component of `G\setminus(\{u\}\cup N(u))` to
which `v` belongs. This connected structure can be computed in time `O(n(n+m))`
using `n` BFS.

Now, a triple `u, v, w\in V` is an asteroidal triple if and only if it satisfies
`M[u][v]==M[u][w]` and `M[v][u]==M[v][w]` and `M[w][u]==M[w][v]`, assuming all
these values are positive. Indeed, if `M[u][v]==M[u][w]`, `v` and `w` are in the
same connected component of `G\setminus(\{u\}\cup N(u))`, and so there is a path
between `v` and `w` avoiding the neighborhood of `u`. The algorithm iterates
over all triples.

    Test if the input graph is asteroidal triple-free

    An independent set of three vertices such that each pair is joined by a path
    that avoids the neighborhood of the third one is called an *asteroidal
    triple*. A graph is asteroidal triple-free (AT-free) if it contains no
    asteroidal triples. See the :mod:`module's documentation
    <sage.graphs.asteroidal_triples>` for more details.

    This method returns ``True`` is the graph is AT-free and ``False`` otherwise.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a Graph

    - ``certificate`` -- (default: False) By default, this method returns
      ``True`` if the graph is asteroidal triple-free and ``False``
      otherwise. When ``certificate==True``, this method returns in addition a
      list of three vertices forming an asteroidal triple if such a triple is
      found, and the empty list otherwise.

    EXAMPLES:

    The complete graph is AT-free, as well as its line graph::

        sage: from sage.graphs.asteroidal_triples import *
        sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
        sage: is_asteroidal_triple_free(G)
        True
        sage: is_asteroidal_triple_free(G, certificate=True)
        (True, [])
        sage: LG = G.line_graph()
        sage: is_asteroidal_triple_free(LG)
        True
        sage: LLG = LG.line_graph()
        sage: is_asteroidal_triple_free(LLG)
        False

    The PetersenGraph is not AT-free::

        sage: from sage.graphs.asteroidal_triples import *
        sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: is_asteroidal_triple_free(G)
        False
        sage: is_asteroidal_triple_free(G, certificate=True)
        (False, [0, 2, 6])

    TEST:

    Giving anything else than a Graph::

        sage: from sage.graphs.asteroidal_triples import is_asteroidal_triple_free
        sage: is_asteroidal_triple_free(DiGraph())
        Traceback (most recent call last):
