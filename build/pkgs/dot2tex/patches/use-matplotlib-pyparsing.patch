-==========
-Change Log
-==========
-
-Version 1.5.2 - April, 2009
-------------------------------
-- Added pyparsing_py3.py module, so that Python 3 users can use
-  pyparsing by changing their pyparsing import statement to:
-  
-      import pyparsing_py3
-
-  Thanks for help from Patrick Laban and his friend Geremy 
-  Condra on the pyparsing wiki.
-  
-- Removed __slots__ declaration on ParseBaseException, for
-  compatibility with IronPython 2.0.1.  Raised by David
-  Lawler on the pyparsing wiki, thanks David!
-  
-- Fixed bug in SkipTo/failOn handling - caught by eagle eye 
-  cpennington on the pyparsing wiki!
-
-- Fixed second bug in SkipTo when using the ignore constructor
-  argument, reported by Catherine Devlin, thanks!
-  
-- Fixed obscure bug reported by Eike Welk when using a class
-  as a ParseAction with an errant __getitem__ method.
-
-- Simplified exception stack traces when reporting parse 
-  exceptions back to caller of parseString or parseFile - thanks
-  to a tip from Peter Otten on comp.lang.python.
-
-- Changed behavior of scanString to avoid infinitely looping on
-  expressions that match zero-length strings.  Prompted by a
-  question posted by ellisonbg on the wiki.
-
-- Enhanced classes that take a list of expressions (And, Or, 
-  MatchFirst, and Each) to accept generator expressions also.
-  This can be useful when generating lists of alternative
-  expressions, as in this case, where the user wanted to match
-  any repetitions of '+', '*', '#', or '.', but not mixtures
-  of them (that is, match '+++', but not '+-+'):
-  
-      codes = "+*#."
-      format = MatchFirst(Word(c) for c in codes)
-      
-  Based on a problem posed by Denis Spir on the Python tutor
-  list.
-
-- Added new example eval_arith.py, which extends the example
-  simpleArith.py to actually evaluate the parsed expressions.
-
-
-Version 1.5.1 - October, 2008
--------------------------------
-- Added new helper method originalTextFor, to replace the use of
-  the current keepOriginalText parse action.  Now instead of 
-  using the parse action, as in:
-  
-      fullName = Word(alphas) + Word(alphas)
-      fullName.setParseAction(keepOriginalText)
-      
-  (in this example, we used keepOriginalText to restore any white
-  space that may have been skipped between the first and last
-  names)
-  You can now write:
-  
-      fullName = originalTextFor(Word(alphas) + Word(alphas))
-      
-  The implementation of originalTextFor is simpler and faster than
-  keepOriginalText, and does not depend on using the inspect or
-  imp modules.
-  
-- Added optional parseAll argument to parseFile, to be consistent
-  with parseAll argument to parseString.  Posted by pboucher on the
-  pyparsing wiki, thanks!
-
-- Added failOn argument to SkipTo, so that grammars can define
-  literal strings or pyparsing expressions which, if found in the
-  skipped text, will cause SkipTo to fail.  Useful to prevent 
-  SkipTo from reading past terminating expression.  Instigated by
-  question posed by Aki Niimura on the pyparsing wiki.
-
-- Fixed bug in nestedExpr if multi-character expressions are given
-  for nesting delimiters.  Patch provided by new pyparsing user,
-  Hans-Martin Gaudecker - thanks, H-M!
-
-- Removed dependency on xml.sax.saxutils.escape, and included
-  internal implementation instead - proposed by Mike Droettboom on
-  the pyparsing mailing list, thanks Mike!  Also fixed erroneous
-  mapping in replaceHTMLEntity of &quot; to ', now correctly maps
-  to ".  (Also added support for mapping &apos; to '.)
-
-- Fixed typo in ParseResults.insert, found by Alejandro Dubrovsky,
-  good catch!
-
-- Added __dir__() methods to ParseBaseException and ParseResults,
-  to support new dir() behavior in Py2.6 and Py3.0.  If dir() is
-  called on a ParseResults object, the returned list will include
-  the base set of attribute names, plus any results names that are
-  defined.
-
-- Fixed bug in ParseResults.asXML(), in which the first named
-  item within a ParseResults gets reported with an <ITEM> tag 
-  instead of with the correct results name.
-  
-- Fixed bug in '-' error stop, when '-' operator is used inside a 
-  Combine expression.
-
-- Reverted generator expression to use list comprehension, for 
-  better compatibility with old versions of Python.  Reported by
-  jester/artixdesign on the SourceForge pyparsing discussion list.
-
-- Fixed bug in parseString(parseAll=True), when the input string
-  ends with a comment or whitespace.
-
-- Fixed bug in LineStart and LineEnd that did not recognize any
-  special whitespace chars defined using ParserElement.setDefault-
-  WhitespaceChars, found while debugging an issue for Marek Kubica,
-  thanks for the new test case, Marek!
-
-- Made Forward class more tolerant of subclassing.
-
-
-Version 1.5.0 - June, 2008
---------------------------
-This version of pyparsing includes work on two long-standing
-FAQ's: support for forcing parsing of the complete input string
-(without having to explicitly append StringEnd() to the grammar),
-and a method to improve the mechanism of detecting where syntax
-errors occur in an input string with various optional and
-alternative paths.  This release also includes a helper method
-to simplify definition of indentation-based grammars.  With
-these changes (and the past few minor updates), I thought it was
-finally time to bump the minor rev number on pyparsing - so
-1.5.0 is now available!  Read on...
-
-- AT LAST!!!  You can now call parseString and have it raise
-  an exception if the expression does not parse the entire
-  input string.  This has been an FAQ for a LONG time.
-
-  The parseString method now includes an optional parseAll
-  argument (default=False).  If parseAll is set to True, then
-  the given parse expression must parse the entire input
-  string.  (This is equivalent to adding StringEnd() to the
-  end of the expression.)  The default value is False to
-  retain backward compatibility.
-
-  Inspired by MANY requests over the years, most recently by
-  ecir-hana on the pyparsing wiki!
-
-- Added new operator '-' for composing grammar sequences. '-'
-  behaves just like '+' in creating And expressions, but '-'
-  is used to mark grammar structures that should stop parsing
-  immediately and report a syntax error, rather than just
-  backtracking to the last successful parse and trying another
-  alternative.  For instance, running the following code:
-
-    port_definition = Keyword("port") + '=' + Word(nums)
-    entity_definition = Keyword("entity") + "{" +
-        Optional(port_definition) + "}"
-
-    entity_definition.parseString("entity { port 100 }")
-
-  pyparsing fails to detect the missing '=' in the port definition.
-  But, since this expression is optional, pyparsing then proceeds
-  to try to match the closing '}' of the entity_definition.  Not
-  finding it, pyparsing reports that there was no '}' after the '{'
-  character.  Instead, we would like pyparsing to parse the 'port'
-  keyword, and if not followed by an equals sign and an integer,
-  to signal this as a syntax error.
-
-  This can now be done simply by changing the port_definition to:
-
-    port_definition = Keyword("port") - '=' + Word(nums)
-
-  Now after successfully parsing 'port', pyparsing must also find
-  an equals sign and an integer, or it will raise a fatal syntax
-  exception.
-
-  By judicious insertion of '-' operators, a pyparsing developer
-  can have their grammar report much more informative syntax error
-  messages.
-
-  Patches and suggestions proposed by several contributors on
-  the pyparsing mailing list and wiki - special thanks to
-  Eike Welk and Thomas/Poldy on the pyparsing wiki!
-
-- Added indentedBlock helper method, to encapsulate the parse
-  actions and indentation stack management needed to keep track of
-  indentation levels.  Use indentedBlock to define grammars for
-  indentation-based grouping grammars, like Python's.
-
-  indentedBlock takes up to 3 parameters:
-    - blockStatementExpr - expression defining syntax of statement
-        that is repeated within the indented block
-    - indentStack - list created by caller to manage indentation
-        stack (multiple indentedBlock expressions
-        within a single grammar should share a common indentStack)
-    - indent - boolean indicating whether block must be indented
-        beyond the the current level; set to False for block of
-        left-most statements (default=True)
-
-  A valid block must contain at least one indented statement.
-
-- Fixed bug in nestedExpr in which ignored expressions needed
-  to be set off with whitespace.  Reported by Stefaan Himpe,
-  nice catch!
-
-- Expanded multiplication of an expression by a tuple, to
-  accept tuple values of None:
-  . expr*(n,None) or expr*(n,) is equivalent
-    to expr*n + ZeroOrMore(expr)
-    (read as "at least n instances of expr")
-  . expr*(None,n) is equivalent to expr*(0,n)
-    (read as "0 to n instances of expr")
-  . expr*(None,None) is equivalent to ZeroOrMore(expr)
-  . expr*(1,None) is equivalent to OneOrMore(expr)
-
-  Note that expr*(None,n) does not raise an exception if
-  more than n exprs exist in the input stream; that is,
-  expr*(None,n) does not enforce a maximum number of expr
-  occurrences.  If this behavior is desired, then write
-  expr*(None,n) + ~expr
-
-- Added None as a possible operator for operatorPrecedence.
-  None signifies "no operator", as in multiplying m times x
-  in "y=mx+b".
-
-- Fixed bug in Each, reported by Michael Ramirez, in which the
-  order of terms in the Each affected the parsing of the results.
-  Problem was due to premature grouping of the expressions in
-  the overall Each during grammar construction, before the
-  complete Each was defined.  Thanks, Michael!
-
-- Also fixed bug in Each in which Optional's with default values
-  were not getting the defaults added to the results of the
-  overall Each expression.
-
-- Fixed a bug in Optional in which results names were not
-  assigned if a default value was supplied.
-
-- Cleaned up Py3K compatibility statements, including exception
-  construction statements, and better equivalence between _ustr
-  and basestring, and __nonzero__ and __bool__.
-
-
-Version 1.4.11 - February, 2008
--------------------------------
-- With help from Robert A. Clark, this version of pyparsing
-  is compatible with Python 3.0a3.  Thanks for the help,
-  Robert!
-
-- Added WordStart and WordEnd positional classes, to support
-  expressions that must occur at the start or end of a word.
-  Proposed by piranha on the pyparsing wiki, good idea!
-
-- Added matchOnlyAtCol helper parser action, to simplify
-  parsing log or data files that have optional fields that are
-  column dependent.  Inspired by a discussion thread with
-  hubritic on comp.lang.python.
-
-- Added withAttribute.ANY_VALUE as a match-all value when using
-  withAttribute.  Used to ensure that an attribute is present,
-  without having to match on the actual attribute value.
-
-- Added get() method to ParseResults, similar to dict.get().
-  Suggested by new pyparsing user, Alejandro Dubrovksy, thanks!
-
-- Added '==' short-cut to see if a given string matches a
-  pyparsing expression.  For instance, you can now write:
-
-    integer = Word(nums)
-    if "123" == integer:
-       # do something
-
-    print [ x for x in "123 234 asld".split() if x==integer ]
-    # prints ['123', '234']
-
-- Simplified the use of nestedExpr when using an expression for
-  the opening or closing delimiters.  Now the content expression
-  will not have to explicitly negate closing delimiters.  Found
-  while working with dfinnie on GHOP Task #277, thanks!
-
-- Fixed bug when defining ignorable expressions that are
-  later enclosed in a wrapper expression (such as ZeroOrMore,
-  OneOrMore, etc.) - found while working with Prabhu
-  Gurumurthy, thanks Prahbu!
-
-- Fixed bug in withAttribute in which keys were automatically
-  converted to lowercase, making it impossible to match XML
-  attributes with uppercase characters in them.  Using with-
-  Attribute requires that you reference attributes in all
-  lowercase if parsing HTML, and in correct case when parsing
-  XML.
-
-- Changed '<<' operator on Forward to return None, since this
-  is really used as a pseudo-assignment operator, not as a
-  left-shift operator.  By returning None, it is easier to
-  catch faulty statements such as a << b | c, where precedence
-  of operations causes the '|' operation to be performed
-  *after* inserting b into a, so no alternation is actually
-  implemented.  The correct form is a << (b | c).  With this
-  change, an error will be reported instead of silently
-  clipping the alternative term.  (Note: this may break some
-  existing code, but if it does, the code had a silent bug in
-  it anyway.)  Proposed by wcbarksdale on the pyparsing wiki,
-  thanks!
-
-- Several unit tests were added to pyparsing's regression
-  suite, courtesy of the Google Highly-Open Participation
-  Contest.  Thanks to all who administered and took part in
-  this event!
-
-
-Version 1.4.10 - December 9, 2007
----------------------------------
-- Fixed bug introduced in v1.4.8, parse actions were called for
-  intermediate operator levels, not just the deepest matching
-  operation level.  Again, big thanks to Torsten Marek for
-  helping isolate this problem!
-
-
-Version 1.4.9 - December 8, 2007
---------------------------------
-- Added '*' multiplication operator support when creating
-  grammars, accepting either an integer, or a two-integer
-  tuple multiplier, as in:
-    ipAddress = Word(nums) + ('.'+Word(nums))*3
-    usPhoneNumber = Word(nums) + ('-'+Word(nums))*(1,2)
-  If multiplying by a tuple, the two integer values represent
-  min and max multiples.  Suggested by Vincent of eToy.com,
-  great idea, Vincent!
-
-- Fixed bug in nestedExpr, original version was overly greedy!
-  Thanks to Michael Ramirez for raising this issue.
-
-- Fixed internal bug in ParseResults - when an item was deleted,
-  the key indices were not updated.  Thanks to Tim Mitchell for
-  posting a bugfix patch to the SF bug tracking system!
-
-- Fixed internal bug in operatorPrecedence - when the results of
-  a right-associative term were sent to a parse action, the wrong
-  tokens were sent.  Reported by Torsten Marek, nice job!
-
-- Added pop() method to ParseResults.  If pop is called with an
-  integer or with no arguments, it will use list semantics and
-  update the ParseResults' list of tokens.  If pop is called with
-  a non-integer (a string, for instance), then it will use dict
-  semantics and update the ParseResults' internal dict.
-  Suggested by Donn Ingle, thanks Donn!
-
-- Fixed quoted string built-ins to accept '\xHH' hex characters
-  within the string.
-
-
-Version 1.4.8 - October, 2007
------------------------------
-- Added new helper method nestedExpr to easily create expressions
-  that parse lists of data in nested parentheses, braces, brackets,
-  etc.
-
-- Added withAttribute parse action helper, to simplify creating
-  filtering parse actions to attach to expressions returned by
-  makeHTMLTags and makeXMLTags.  Use withAttribute to qualify a
-  starting tag with one or more required attribute values, to avoid
-  false matches on common tags such as <TD> or <DIV>.
-
-- Added new examples nested.py and withAttribute.py to demonstrate
-  the new features.
-
-- Added performance speedup to grammars using operatorPrecedence,
-  instigated by Stefan Reichör - thanks for the feedback, Stefan!
-
-- Fixed bug/typo when deleting an element from a ParseResults by
-  using the element's results name.
-
-- Fixed whitespace-skipping bug in wrapper classes (such as Group,
-  Suppress, Combine, etc.) and when using setDebug(), reported by
-  new pyparsing user dazzawazza on SourceForge, nice job!
-
-- Added restriction to prevent defining Word or CharsNotIn expressions
-  with minimum length of 0 (should use Optional if this is desired),
-  and enhanced docstrings to reflect this limitation.  Issue was
-  raised by Joey Tallieu, who submitted a patch with a slightly
-  different solution.  Thanks for taking the initiative, Joey, and
-  please keep submitting your ideas!
-
-- Fixed bug in makeHTMLTags that did not detect HTML tag attributes
-  with no '= value' portion (such as "<td nowrap>"), reported by
-  hamidh on the pyparsing wiki - thanks!
-
-- Fixed minor bug in makeHTMLTags and makeXMLTags, which did not
-  accept whitespace in closing tags.
-
-
-Version 1.4.7 - July, 2007
---------------------------
-- NEW NOTATION SHORTCUT: ParserElement now accepts results names using
-  a notational shortcut, following the expression with the results name
-  in parentheses.  So this:
-
-    stats = "AVE:" + realNum.setResultsName("average") + \
-            "MIN:" + realNum.setResultsName("min") + \
-            "MAX:" + realNum.setResultsName("max")
-
-  can now be written as this:
-
-    stats = "AVE:" + realNum("average") + \
-            "MIN:" + realNum("min") + \
-            "MAX:" + realNum("max")
-
-  The intent behind this change is to make it simpler to define results
-  names for significant fields within the expression, while keeping
-  the grammar syntax clean and uncluttered.
-
-- Fixed bug when packrat parsing is enabled, with cached ParseResults
-  being updated by subsequent parsing.  Reported on the pyparsing
-  wiki by Kambiz, thanks!
-
-- Fixed bug in operatorPrecedence for unary operators with left
-  associativity, if multiple operators were given for the same term.
-
-- Fixed bug in example simpleBool.py, corrected precedence of "and" vs.
-  "or" operations.
-
-- Fixed bug in Dict class, in which keys were converted to strings
-  whether they needed to be or not.  Have narrowed this logic to
-  convert keys to strings only if the keys are ints (which would
-  confuse __getitem__ behavior for list indexing vs. key lookup).
-
-- Added ParserElement method setBreak(), which will invoke the pdb
-  module's set_trace() function when this expression is about to be
-  parsed.
-
-- Fixed bug in StringEnd in which reading off the end of the input
-  string raises an exception - should match.  Resolved while
-  answering a question for Shawn on the pyparsing wiki.
-
-
-Version 1.4.6 - April, 2007
----------------------------
-- Simplified constructor for ParseFatalException, to support common
-  exception construction idiom:
-    raise ParseFatalException, "unexpected text: 'Spanish Inquisition'"
-
-- Added method getTokensEndLoc(), to be called from within a parse action,
-  for those parse actions that need both the starting *and* ending
-  location of the parsed tokens within the input text.
-
-- Enhanced behavior of keepOriginalText so that named parse fields are
-  preserved, even though tokens are replaced with the original input
-  text matched by the current expression.  Also, cleaned up the stack
-  traversal to be more robust.  Suggested by Tim Arnold - thanks, Tim!
-
-- Fixed subtle bug in which countedArray (and similar dynamic
-  expressions configured in parse actions) failed to match within Or,
-  Each, FollowedBy, or NotAny.  Reported by Ralf Vosseler, thanks for
-  your patience, Ralf!
-
-- Fixed Unicode bug in upcaseTokens and downcaseTokens parse actions,
-  scanString, and default debugging actions; reported (and patch submitted)
-  by Nikolai Zamkovoi, spasibo!
-
-- Fixed bug when saving a tuple as a named result.  The returned
-  token list gave the proper tuple value, but accessing the result by
-  name only gave the first element of the tuple.  Reported by
-  Poromenos, nice catch!
-
-- Fixed bug in makeHTMLTags/makeXMLTags, which failed to match tag
-  attributes with namespaces.
-
-- Fixed bug in SkipTo when setting include=True, to have the skipped-to
-  tokens correctly included in the returned data.  Reported by gunars on
-  the pyparsing wiki, thanks!
-
-- Fixed typobug in OnceOnly.reset method, omitted self argument.
-  Submitted by eike welk, thanks for the lint-picking!
-
-- Added performance enhancement to Forward class, suggested by
-  akkartik on the pyparsing Wiki discussion, nice work!
-
-- Added optional asKeyword to Word constructor, to indicate that the
-  given word pattern should be matched only as a keyword, that is, it
-  should only match if it is within word boundaries.
-
-- Added S-expression parser to examples directory.
-
-- Added macro substitution example to examples directory.
-
-- Added holaMundo.py example, excerpted from Marco Alfonso's blog -
-  muchas gracias, Marco!
-
-- Modified internal cyclic references in ParseResults to use weakrefs;
-  this should help reduce the memory footprint of large parsing
-  programs, at some cost to performance (3-5%). Suggested by bca48150 on
-  the pyparsing wiki, thanks!
-
-- Enhanced the documentation describing the vagaries and idiosyncracies
-  of parsing strings with embedded tabs, and the impact on:
-  . parse actions
-  . scanString
-  . col and line helper functions
-  (Suggested by eike welk in response to some unexplained inconsistencies
-  between parsed location and offsets in the input string.)
-
-- Cleaned up internal decorators to preserve function names,
-  docstrings, etc.
-
-
-Version 1.4.5 - December, 2006
-------------------------------
-- Removed debugging print statement from QuotedString class.  Sorry
-  for not stripping this out before the 1.4.4 release!
-
-- A significant performance improvement, the first one in a while!
-  For my Verilog parser, this version of pyparsing is about double the
-  speed - YMMV.
-
-- Added support for pickling of ParseResults objects.  (Reported by
-  Jeff Poole, thanks Jeff!)
-
-- Fixed minor bug in makeHTMLTags that did not recognize tag attributes
-  with embedded '-' or '_' characters.  Also, added support for
-  passing expressions to makeHTMLTags and makeXMLTags, and used this
-  feature to define the globals anyOpenTag and anyCloseTag.
-
-- Fixed error in alphas8bit, I had omitted the y-with-umlaut character.
-
-- Added punc8bit string to complement alphas8bit - it contains all the
-  non-alphabetic, non-blank 8-bit characters.
-
-- Added commonHTMLEntity expression, to match common HTML "ampersand"
-  codes, such as "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", "&nbsp;", and "&quot;".  This
-  expression also defines a results name 'entity', which can be used
-  to extract the entity field (that is, "lt", "gt", etc.).  Also added
-  built-in parse action replaceHTMLEntity, which can be attached to
-  commonHTMLEntity to translate "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", "&nbsp;", and
-  "&quot;" to "<", ">", "&", " ", and "'".
-
-- Added example, htmlStripper.py, that strips HTML tags and scripts
-  from HTML pages.  It also translates common HTML entities to their
-  respective characters.
-
-
-Version 1.4.4 - October, 2006
--------------------------------
-- Fixed traceParseAction decorator to also trap and record exception
-  returns from parse actions, and to handle parse actions with 0,
-  1, 2, or 3 arguments.
-
-- Enhanced parse action normalization to support using classes as
-  parse actions; that is, the class constructor is called at parse
-  time and the __init__ function is called with 0, 1, 2, or 3
-  arguments.  If passing a class as a parse action, the __init__
-  method must use one  of the valid parse action parameter list
-  formats. (This technique is useful when using pyparsing to compile
-  parsed text into a series of application objects - see the new
-  example simpleBool.py.)
-
-- Fixed bug in ParseResults when setting an item using an integer
-  index. (Reported by Christopher Lambacher, thanks!)
-
-- Fixed whitespace-skipping bug, patch submitted by Paolo Losi -
-  grazie, Paolo!
-
-- Fixed bug when a Combine contained an embedded Forward expression,
-  reported by cie on the pyparsing wiki - good catch!
-
-- Fixed listAllMatches bug, when a listAllMatches result was
-  nested within another result. (Reported by don pasquale on
-  comp.lang.python, well done!)
-
-- Fixed bug in ParseResults items() method, when returning an item
-  marked as listAllMatches=True
-
-- Fixed bug in definition of cppStyleComment (and javaStyleComment)
-  in which '//' line comments were not continued to the next line
-  if the line ends with a '\'.  (Reported by eagle-eyed Ralph
-  Corderoy!)
-
-- Optimized re's for cppStyleComment and quotedString for better
-  re performance - also provided by Ralph Corderoy, thanks!
-
-- Added new example, indentedGrammarExample.py, showing how to
-  define a grammar using indentation to show grouping (as Python
-  does for defining statement nesting).  Instigated by an e-mail
-  discussion with Andrew Dalke, thanks Andrew!
-
-- Added new helper operatorPrecedence (based on e-mail list discussion
-  with Ralph Corderoy and Paolo Losi), to facilitate definition of
-  grammars for expressions with unary and binary operators.  For
-  instance, this grammar defines a 6-function arithmetic expression
-  grammar, with unary plus and minus, proper operator precedence,and
-  right- and left-associativity:
-
-    expr = operatorPrecedence( operand,
-        [("!", 1, opAssoc.LEFT),
-         ("^", 2, opAssoc.RIGHT),
-         (oneOf("+ -"), 1, opAssoc.RIGHT),
-         (oneOf("* /"), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),
-         (oneOf("+ -"), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),]
-        )
-
-  Also added example simpleArith.py and simpleBool.py to provide
-  more detailed code samples using this new helper method.
-
-- Added new helpers matchPreviousLiteral and matchPreviousExpr, for
-  creating adaptive parsing expressions that match the same content
-  as was parsed in a previous parse expression.  For instance:
-
-        first = Word(nums)
-        matchExpr = first + ":" + matchPreviousLiteral(first)
-
-  will match "1:1", but not "1:2".  Since this matches at the literal
-  level, this will also match the leading "1:1" in "1:10".
-
-  In contrast:
-
-        first = Word(nums)
-        matchExpr = first + ":" + matchPreviousExpr(first)
-
-  will *not* match the leading "1:1" in "1:10"; the expressions are
-  evaluated first, and then compared, so "1" is compared with "10".
-
-- Added keepOriginalText parse action.  Sometimes pyparsing's
-  whitespace-skipping leaves out too much whitespace.  Adding this
-  parse action will restore any internal whitespace for a parse
-  expression.  This is especially useful when defining expressions
-  for scanString or transformString applications.
-
-- Added __add__ method for ParseResults class, to better support
-  using Python sum built-in for summing ParseResults objects returned
-  from scanString.
-
-- Added reset method for the new OnlyOnce class wrapper for parse
-  actions (to allow a grammar to be used multiple times).
-
-- Added optional maxMatches argument to scanString and searchString,
-  to short-circuit scanning after 'n' expression matches are found.
-
-
-Version 1.4.3 - July, 2006
-------------------------------
-- Fixed implementation of multiple parse actions for an expression
-  (added in 1.4.2).
-  . setParseAction() reverts to its previous behavior, setting
-    one (or more) actions for an expression, overwriting any
-    action or actions previously defined
-  . new method addParseAction() appends one or more parse actions
-    to the list of parse actions attached to an expression
-  Now it is harder to accidentally append parse actions to an
-  expression, when what you wanted to do was overwrite whatever had
-  been defined before.  (Thanks, Jean-Paul Calderone!)
-
-- Simplified interface to parse actions that do not require all 3
-  parse action arguments.  Very rarely do parse actions require more
-  than just the parsed tokens, yet parse actions still require all
-  3 arguments including the string being parsed and the location
-  within the string where the parse expression was matched.  With this
-  release, parse actions may now be defined to be called as:
-  . fn(string,locn,tokens)  (the current form)
-  . fn(locn,tokens)
-  . fn(tokens)
-  . fn()
-  The setParseAction and addParseAction methods will internally decorate
-  the provided parse actions with compatible wrappers to conform to
-  the full (string,locn,tokens) argument sequence.
-
-- REMOVED SUPPORT FOR RETURNING PARSE LOCATION FROM A PARSE ACTION.
-  I announced this in March, 2004, and gave a final warning in the last
-  release.  Now you can return a tuple from a parse action, and it will
-  be treated like any other return value (i.e., the tuple will be
-  substituted for the incoming tokens passed to the parse action,
-  which is useful when trying to parse strings into tuples).
-
-- Added setFailAction method, taking a callable function fn that
-  takes the arguments fn(s,loc,expr,err) where:
-  . s - string being parsed
-  . loc - location where expression match was attempted and failed
-  . expr - the parse expression that failed
-  . err - the exception thrown
-  The function returns no values.  It may throw ParseFatalException
-  if it is desired to stop parsing immediately.
-  (Suggested by peter21081944 on wikispaces.com)
-
-- Added class OnlyOnce as helper wrapper for parse actions.  OnlyOnce
-  only permits a parse action to be called one time, after which
-  all subsequent calls throw a ParseException.
-
-- Added traceParseAction decorator to help debug parse actions.
-  Simply insert "@traceParseAction" ahead of the definition of your
-  parse action, and each invocation will be displayed, along with
-  incoming arguments, and returned value.
-
-- Fixed bug when copying ParserElements using copy() or
-  setResultsName().  (Reported by Dan Thill, great catch!)
-
-- Fixed bug in asXML() where token text contains <, >, and &
-  characters - generated XML now escapes these as &lt;, &gt; and
-  &amp;.  (Reported by Jacek Sieka, thanks!)
-
-- Fixed bug in SkipTo() when searching for a StringEnd(). (Reported
-  by Pete McEvoy, thanks Pete!)
-
-- Fixed "except Exception" statements, the most critical added as part
-  of the packrat parsing enhancement.  (Thanks, Erick Tryzelaar!)
-
-- Fixed end-of-string infinite looping on LineEnd and StringEnd
-  expressions.  (Thanks again to Erick Tryzelaar.)
-
-- Modified setWhitespaceChars to return self, to be consistent with
-  other ParserElement modifiers. (Suggested by Erick Tryzelaar.)
-
-- Fixed bug/typo in new ParseResults.dump() method.
-
-- Fixed bug in searchString() method, in which only the first token of
-  an expression was returned.  searchString() now returns a
-  ParseResults collection of all search matches.
-
-- Added example program removeLineBreaks.py, a string transformer that
-  converts text files with hard line-breaks into one with line breaks
-  only between paragraphs.
-
-- Added example program listAllMatches.py, to illustrate using the
-  listAllMatches option when specifying results names (also shows new
-  support for passing lists to oneOf).
-
-- Added example program linenoExample.py, to illustrate using the
-  helper methods lineno, line, and col, and returning objects from a
-  parse action.
-
-- Added example program parseListString.py, to which can parse the
-  string representation of a Python list back into a true list.  Taken
-  mostly from my PyCon presentation examples, but now with support
-  for tuple elements, too!
-
-
-
-Version 1.4.2 - April 1, 2006 (No foolin'!)
--------------------------------------------
-- Significant speedup from memoizing nested expressions (a technique
-  known as "packrat parsing"), thanks to Chris Lesniewski-Laas!  Your
-  mileage may vary, but my Verilog parser almost doubled in speed to
-  over 600 lines/sec!
-
-  This speedup may break existing programs that use parse actions that
-  have side-effects.  For this reason, packrat parsing is disabled when
-  you first import pyparsing.  To activate the packrat feature, your
-  program must call the class method ParserElement.enablePackrat().  If
-  your program uses psyco to "compile as you go", you must call
-  enablePackrat before calling psyco.full().  If you do not do this,
-  Python will crash.  For best results, call enablePackrat() immediately
-  after importing pyparsing.
-
-- Added new helper method countedArray(expr), for defining patterns that
-  start with a leading integer to indicate the number of array elements,
-  followed by that many elements, matching the given expr parse
-  expression.  For instance, this two-liner:
-    wordArray = countedArray(Word(alphas))
-    print wordArray.parseString("3 Practicality beats purity")[0]
-  returns the parsed array of words:
-    ['Practicality', 'beats', 'purity']
-  The leading token '3' is suppressed, although it is easily obtained
-  from the length of the returned array.
-  (Inspired by e-mail discussion with Ralf Vosseler.)
-
-- Added support for attaching multiple parse actions to a single
-  ParserElement. (Suggested by Dan "Dang" Griffith - nice idea, Dan!)
-
-- Added support for asymmetric quoting characters in the recently-added
-  QuotedString class.  Now you can define your own quoted string syntax
-  like "<<This is a string in double angle brackets.>>".  To define
-  this custom form of QuotedString, your code would define:
-    dblAngleQuotedString = QuotedString('<<',endQuoteChar='>>')
-  QuotedString also supports escaped quotes, escape character other
-  than '\', and multiline.
-
-- Changed the default value returned internally by Optional, so that
-  None can be used as a default value.  (Suggested by Steven Bethard -
-  I finally saw the light!)
-
-- Added dump() method to ParseResults, to make it easier to list out
-  and diagnose values returned from calling parseString.
-
-- A new example, a search query string parser, submitted by Steven
-  Mooij and Rudolph Froger - a very interesting application, thanks!
-
-- Added an example that parses the BNF in Python's Grammar file, in
-  support of generating Python grammar documentation. (Suggested by
-  J H Stovall.)
-
-- A new example, submitted by Tim Cera, of a flexible parser module,
-  using a simple config variable to adjust parsing for input formats
-  that have slight variations - thanks, Tim!
-
-- Added an example for parsing Roman numerals, showing the capability
-  of parse actions to "compile" Roman numerals into their integer
-  values during parsing.
-
-- Added a new docs directory, for additional documentation or help.
-  Currently, this includes the text and examples from my recent
-  presentation at PyCon.
-
-- Fixed another typo in CaselessKeyword, thanks Stefan Behnel.
-
-- Expanded oneOf to also accept tuples, not just lists.  This really
-  should be sufficient...
-
-- Added deprecation warnings when tuple is returned from a parse action.
-  Looking back, I see that I originally deprecated this feature in March,
-  2004, so I'm guessing people really shouldn't have been using this
-  feature - I'll drop it altogether in the next release, which will
-  allow users to return a tuple from a parse action (which is really
-  handy when trying to reconstuct tuples from a tuple string
-  representation!).
-
-
-Version 1.4.1 - February, 2006
-------------------------------
-- Converted generator expression in QuotedString class to list
-  comprehension, to retain compatibility with Python 2.3. (Thanks, Titus
-  Brown for the heads-up!)
-
-- Added searchString() method to ParserElement, as an alternative to
-  using "scanString(instring).next()[0][0]" to search through a string
-  looking for a substring matching a given parse expression. (Inspired by
-  e-mail conversation with Dave Feustel.)
-
-- Modified oneOf to accept lists of strings as well as a single string
-  of space-delimited literals.  (Suggested by Jacek Sieka - thanks!)
-
-- Removed deprecated use of Upcase in pyparsing test code. (Also caught by
-  Titus Brown.)
-
-- Removed lstrip() call from Literal - too aggressive in stripping
-  whitespace which may be valid for some grammars.  (Point raised by Jacek
-  Sieka).  Also, made Literal more robust in the event of passing an empty
-  string.
-
-- Fixed bug in replaceWith when returning None.
-
-- Added cautionary documentation for Forward class when assigning a
-  MatchFirst expression, as in:
-    fwdExpr << a | b | c
-  Precedence of operators causes this to be evaluated as:
-    (fwdExpr << a) | b | c
-  thereby leaving b and c out as parseable alternatives.  Users must
-  explicitly group the values inserted into the Forward:
-    fwdExpr << (a | b | c)
-  (Suggested by Scot Wilcoxon - thanks, Scot!)
-
-
-Version 1.4 - January 18, 2006
-------------------------------
-- Added Regex class, to permit definition of complex embedded expressions
-  using regular expressions. (Enhancement provided by John Beisley, great
-  job!)
-
-- Converted implementations of Word, oneOf, quoted string, and comment
-  helpers to utilize regular expression matching.  Performance improvements
-  in the 20-40% range.
-
-- Added QuotedString class, to support definition of non-standard quoted
-  strings (Suggested by Guillaume Proulx, thanks!)
-
-- Added CaselessKeyword class, to streamline grammars with, well, caseless
-  keywords (Proposed by Stefan Behnel, thanks!)
-
-- Fixed bug in SkipTo, when using an ignoreable expression. (Patch provided
-  by Anonymous, thanks, whoever-you-are!)
-
-- Fixed typo in NoMatch class. (Good catch, Stefan Behnel!)
-
-- Fixed minor bug in _makeTags(), using string.printables instead of
-  pyparsing.printables.
-
-- Cleaned up some of the expressions created by makeXXXTags helpers, to
-  suppress extraneous <> characters.
-
-- Added some grammar definition-time checking to verify that a grammar is
-  being built using proper ParserElements.
-
-- Added examples:
-  . LAparser.py - linear algebra C preprocessor (submitted by Mike Ellis,
-    thanks Mike!)
-  . wordsToNum.py - converts word description of a number back to
-    the original number (such as 'one hundred and twenty three' -> 123)
-  . updated fourFn.py to support unary minus, added BNF comments
-
-
-Version 1.3.3 - September 12, 2005
-----------------------------------
-- Improved support for Unicode strings that would be returned using
-  srange.  Added greetingInKorean.py example, for a Korean version of
-  "Hello, World!" using Unicode. (Thanks, June Kim!)
-
-- Added 'hexnums' string constant (nums+"ABCDEFabcdef") for defining
-  hexadecimal value expressions.
-
-- NOTE: ===THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK EXISTING CODE===
-  Modified tag and results definitions returned by makeHTMLTags(),
-  to better support the looseness of HTML parsing.  Tags to be
-  parsed are now caseless, and keys generated for tag attributes are
-  now converted to lower case.
-
-  Formerly, makeXMLTags("XYZ") would return a tag with results
-  name of "startXYZ", this has been changed to "startXyz".  If this
-  tag is matched against '<XYZ Abc="1" DEF="2" ghi="3">', the
-  matched keys formerly would be "Abc", "DEF", and "ghi"; keys are
-  now converted to lower case, giving keys of "abc", "def", and
-  "ghi".  These changes were made to try to address the lax
-  case sensitivity agreement between start and end tags in many
-  HTML pages.
-
-  No changes were made to makeXMLTags(), which assumes more rigorous
-  parsing rules.
-
-  Also, cleaned up case-sensitivity bugs in closing tags, and
-  switched to using Keyword instead of Literal class for tags.
-  (Thanks, Steve Young, for getting me to look at these in more
-  detail!)
-
-- Added two helper parse actions, upcaseTokens and downcaseTokens,
-  which will convert matched text to all uppercase or lowercase,
-  respectively.
-
-- Deprecated Upcase class, to be replaced by upcaseTokens parse
-  action.
-
-- Converted messages sent to stderr to use warnings module, such as
-  when constructing a Literal with an empty string, one should use
-  the Empty() class or the empty helper instead.
-
-- Added ' ' (space) as an escapable character within a quoted
-  string.
-
-- Added helper expressions for common comment types, in addition
-  to the existing cStyleComment (/*...*/) and htmlStyleComment
-  (<!-- ... -->)
-  . dblSlashComment = // ... (to end of line)
-  . cppStyleComment = cStyleComment or dblSlashComment
-  . javaStyleComment = cppStyleComment
-  . pythonStyleComment = # ... (to end of line)
-
-
-
-Version 1.3.2 - July 24, 2005
------------------------------
-- Added Each class as an enhanced version of And.  'Each' requires
-  that all given expressions be present, but may occur in any order.
-  Special handling is provided to group ZeroOrMore and OneOrMore
-  elements that occur out-of-order in the input string.  You can also
-  construct 'Each' objects by joining expressions with the '&'
-  operator.  When using the Each class, results names are strongly
-  recommended for accessing the matched tokens. (Suggested by Pradam
-  Amini - thanks, Pradam!)
-
-- Stricter interpretation of 'max' qualifier on Word elements.  If the
-  'max' attribute is specified, matching will fail if an input field
-  contains more than 'max' consecutive body characters.  For example,
-  previously, Word(nums,max=3) would match the first three characters
-  of '0123456', returning '012' and continuing parsing at '3'.  Now,
-  when constructed using the max attribute, Word will raise an
-  exception with this string.
-
-- Cleaner handling of nested dictionaries returned by Dict.  No
-  longer necessary to dereference sub-dictionaries as element [0] of
-  their parents.
-  === NOTE: THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK SOME EXISTING CODE, BUT ONLY IF
-  PARSING NESTED DICTIONARIES USING THE LITTLE-USED DICT CLASS ===
-  (Prompted by discussion thread on the Python Tutor list, with
-  contributions from Danny Yoo, Kent Johnson, and original post by
-  Liam Clarke - thanks all!)
-
-
-
-Version 1.3.1 - June, 2005
-----------------------------------
-- Added markInputline() method to ParseException, to display the input
-  text line location of the parsing exception. (Thanks, Stefan Behnel!)
-
-- Added setDefaultKeywordChars(), so that Keyword definitions using a
-  custom keyword character set do not all need to add the keywordChars
-  constructor argument (similar to setDefaultWhitespaceChars()).
-  (suggested by rzhanka on the SourceForge pyparsing forum.)
-
-- Simplified passing debug actions to setDebugAction().  You can now
-  pass 'None' for a debug action if you want to take the default
-  debug behavior.  To suppress a particular debug action, you can pass
-  the pyparsing method nullDebugAction.
-
-- Refactored parse exception classes, moved all behavior to
-  ParseBaseException, and the former ParseException is now a subclass of
-  ParseBaseException.  Added a second subclass, ParseFatalException, as
-  a subclass of ParseBaseException.  User-defined parse actions can raise
-  ParseFatalException if a data inconsistency is detected (such as a
-  begin-tag/end-tag mismatch), and this will stop all parsing immediately.
-  (Inspired by e-mail thread with Michele Petrazzo - thanks, Michelle!)
-
-- Added helper methods makeXMLTags and makeHTMLTags, that simplify the
-  definition of XML or HTML tag parse expressions for a given tagname.
-  Both functions return a pair of parse expressions, one for the opening
-  tag (that is, '<tagname>') and one for the closing tag ('</tagname>').
-  The opening tagame also recognizes any attribute definitions that have
-  been included in the opening tag, as well as an empty tag (one with a
-  trailing '/', as in '<BODY/>' which is equivalent to '<BODY></BODY>').
-  makeXMLTags uses stricter XML syntax for attributes, requiring that they
-  be enclosed in double quote characters - makeHTMLTags is more lenient,
-  and accepts single-quoted strings or any contiguous string of characters
-  up to the next whitespace character or '>' character.  Attributes can
-  be retrieved as dictionary or attribute values of the returned results
-  from the opening tag.
-
-- Added example minimath2.py, a refinement on fourFn.py that adds
-  an interactive session and support for variables.  (Thanks, Steven Siew!)
-
-- Added performance improvement, up to 20% reduction!  (Found while working
-  with Wolfgang Borgert on performance tuning of his TTCN3 parser.)
-
-- And another performance improvement, up to 25%, when using scanString!
-  (Found while working with Henrik Westlund on his C header file scanner.)
-
-- Updated UML diagrams to reflect latest class/method changes.
-
-
-Version 1.3 - March, 2005
-----------------------------------
-- Added new Keyword class, as a special form of Literal.  Keywords
-  must be followed by whitespace or other non-keyword characters, to
-  distinguish them from variables or other identifiers that just
-  happen to start with the same characters as a keyword.  For instance,
-  the input string containing "ifOnlyIfOnly" will match a Literal("if")
-  at the beginning and in the middle, but will fail to match a
-  Keyword("if").  Keyword("if") will match only strings such as "if only"
-  or "if(only)". (Proposed by Wolfgang Borgert, and Berteun Damman
-  separately requested this on comp.lang.python - great idea!)
-
-- Added setWhitespaceChars() method to override the characters to be
-  skipped as whitespace before matching a particular ParseElement.  Also
-  added the class-level method setDefaultWhitespaceChars(), to allow
-  users to override the default set of whitespace characters (space,
-  tab, newline, and return) for all subsequently defined ParseElements.
-  (Inspired by Klaas Hofstra's inquiry on the Sourceforge pyparsing
-  forum.)
-
-- Added helper parse actions to support some very common parse
-  action use cases:
-  . replaceWith(replStr) - replaces the matching tokens with the
-    provided replStr replacement string; especially useful with
-    transformString()
-  . removeQuotes - removes first and last character from string enclosed
-    in quotes (note - NOT the same as the string strip() method, as only
-    a single character is removed at each end)
-
-- Added copy() method to ParseElement, to make it easier to define
-  different parse actions for the same basic parse expression.  (Note, copy
-  is implicitly called when using setResultsName().)
-
-
-  (The following changes were posted to CVS as Version 1.2.3 -
-  October-December, 2004)
-
-- Added support for Unicode strings in creating grammar definitions.
-  (Big thanks to Gavin Panella!)
-
-- Added constant alphas8bit to include the following 8-bit characters:
-    ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõöøùúûüýþ
-
-- Added srange() function to simplify definition of Word elements, using
-  regexp-like '[A-Za-z0-9]' syntax.  This also simplifies referencing
-  common 8-bit characters.
-
-- Fixed bug in Dict when a single element Dict was embedded within another
-  Dict. (Thanks Andy Yates for catching this one!)
-
-- Added 'formatted' argument to ParseResults.asXML().  If set to False,
-  suppresses insertion of whitespace for pretty-print formatting.  Default
-  equals True for backward compatibility.
-
-- Added setDebugActions() function to ParserElement, to allow user-defined
-  debugging actions.
-
-- Added support for escaped quotes (either in \', \", or doubled quote
-  form) to the predefined expressions for quoted strings. (Thanks, Ero
-  Carrera!)
-
-- Minor performance improvement (~5%) converting "char in string" tests
-  to "char in dict". (Suggested by Gavin Panella, cool idea!)
-
-
-Version 1.2.2 - September 27, 2004
-----------------------------------
-- Modified delimitedList to accept an expression as the delimiter, instead
-  of only accepting strings.
-
-- Modified ParseResults, to convert integer field keys to strings (to
-  avoid confusion with list access).
-
-- Modified Combine, to convert all embedded tokens to strings before
-  combining.
-
-- Fixed bug in MatchFirst in which parse actions would be called for
-  expressions that only partially match. (Thanks, John Hunter!)
-
-- Fixed bug in fourFn.py example that fixes right-associativity of ^
-  operator. (Thanks, Andrea Griffini!)
-
-- Added class FollowedBy(expression), to look ahead in the input string
-  without consuming tokens.
-
-- Added class NoMatch that never matches any input. Can be useful in
-  debugging, and in very specialized grammars.
-
-- Added example pgn.py, for parsing chess game files stored in Portable
-  Game Notation. (Thanks, Alberto Santini!)
-
-
-Version 1.2.1 - August 19, 2004
--------------------------------
-- Added SkipTo(expression) token type, simplifying grammars that only
-  want to specify delimiting expressions, and want to match any characters
-  between them.
-
-- Added helper method dictOf(key,value), making it easier to work with
-  the Dict class. (Inspired by Pavel Volkovitskiy, thanks!).
-
-- Added optional argument listAllMatches (default=False) to
-  setResultsName().  Setting listAllMatches to True overrides the default
-  modal setting of tokens to results names; instead, the results name
-  acts as an accumulator for all matching tokens within the local
-  repetition group. (Suggested by Amaury Le Leyzour - thanks!)
-
-- Fixed bug in ParseResults, throwing exception when trying to extract
-  slice, or make a copy using [:]. (Thanks, Wilson Fowlie!)
-
-- Fixed bug in transformString() when the input string contains <TAB>'s
-  (Thanks, Rick Walia!).
-
-- Fixed bug in returning tokens from un-Grouped And's, Or's and
-  MatchFirst's, where too many tokens would be included in the results,
-  confounding parse actions and returned results.
-
-- Fixed bug in naming ParseResults returned by And's, Or's, and Match
-  First's.
-
-- Fixed bug in LineEnd() - matching this token now correctly consumes
-  and returns the end of line "\n".
-
-- Added a beautiful example for parsing Mozilla calendar files (Thanks,
-  Petri Savolainen!).
-
-- Added support for dynamically modifying Forward expressions during
-  parsing.
-
-
-Version 1.2 - 20 June 2004
---------------------------
-- Added definition for htmlComment to help support HTML scanning and
-  parsing.
-
-- Fixed bug in generating XML for Dict classes, in which trailing item was
-  duplicated in the output XML.
-
-- Fixed release bug in which scanExamples.py was omitted from release
-  files.
-
-- Fixed bug in transformString() when parse actions are not defined on the
-  outermost parser element.
-
-- Added example urlExtractor.py, as another example of using scanString
-  and parse actions.
-
-
-Version 1.2beta3 - 4 June 2004
-------------------------------
-- Added White() token type, analogous to Word, to match on whitespace
-  characters.  Use White in parsers with significant whitespace (such as
-  configuration file parsers that use indentation to indicate grouping).
-  Construct White with a string containing the whitespace characters to be
-  matched.  Similar to Word, White also takes optional min, max, and exact
-  parameters.
-
-- As part of supporting whitespace-signficant parsing, added parseWithTabs()
-  method to ParserElement, to override the default behavior in parseString
-  of automatically expanding tabs to spaces.  To retain tabs during
-  parsing, call parseWithTabs() before calling parseString(), parseFile() or
-  scanString(). (Thanks, Jean-Guillaume Paradis for catching this, and for
-  your suggestions on whitespace-significant parsing.)
-
-- Added transformString() method to ParseElement, as a complement to
-  scanString().  To use transformString, define a grammar and attach a parse
-  action to the overall grammar that modifies the returned token list.
-  Invoking transformString() on a target string will then scan for matches,
-  and replace the matched text patterns according to the logic in the parse
-  action.  transformString() returns the resulting transformed string.
-  (Note: transformString() does *not* automatically expand tabs to spaces.)
-  Also added scanExamples.py to the examples directory to show sample uses of
-  scanString() and transformString().
-
-- Removed group() method that was introduced in beta2.  This turns out NOT to
-  be equivalent to nesting within a Group() object, and I'd prefer not to sow
-  more seeds of confusion.
-
-- Fixed behavior of asXML() where tags for groups were incorrectly duplicated.
-  (Thanks, Brad Clements!)
-
-- Changed beta version message to display to stderr instead of stdout, to
-  make asXML() easier to use.  (Thanks again, Brad.)
-
-
-Version 1.2beta2 - 19 May 2004
-------------------------------
-- *** SIMPLIFIED API *** - Parse actions that do not modify the list of tokens
-  no longer need to return a value.  This simplifies those parse actions that
-  use the list of tokens to update a counter or record or display some of the
-  token content; these parse actions can simply end without having to specify
-  'return toks'.
-
-- *** POSSIBLE API INCOMPATIBILITY *** - Fixed CaselessLiteral bug, where the
-  returned token text was not the original string (as stated in the docs),
-  but the original string converted to upper case.  (Thanks, Dang Griffith!)
-  **NOTE: this may break some code that relied on this erroneous behavior.
-  Users should scan their code for uses of CaselessLiteral.**
-
-- *** POSSIBLE CODE INCOMPATIBILITY *** - I have renamed the internal
-  attributes on ParseResults from 'dict' and 'list' to '__tokdict' and
-  '__toklist', to avoid collisions with user-defined data fields named 'dict'
-  and 'list'.  Any client code that accesses these attributes directly will
-  need to be modified.  Hopefully the implementation of methods such as keys(),
-  items(), len(), etc. on ParseResults will make such direct attribute
-  accessess unnecessary.
-
-- Added asXML() method to ParseResults.  This greatly simplifies the process
-  of parsing an input data file and generating XML-structured data.
-
-- Added getName() method to ParseResults.  This method is helpful when
-  a grammar specifies ZeroOrMore or OneOrMore of a MatchFirst or Or
-  expression, and the parsing code needs to know which expression matched.
-  (Thanks, Eric van der Vlist, for this idea!)
-
-- Added items() and values() methods to ParseResults, to better support using
-  ParseResults as a Dictionary.
-
-- Added parseFile() as a convenience function to parse the contents of an
-  entire text file.  Accepts either a file name or a file object.  (Thanks
-  again, Dang!)
-
-- Added group() method to And, Or, and MatchFirst, as a short-cut alternative
-  to enclosing a construct inside a Group object.
-
-- Extended fourFn.py to support exponentiation, and simple built-in functions.
-
-- Added EBNF parser to examples, including a demo where it parses its own
-  EBNF!  (Thanks to Seo Sanghyeon!)
-
-- Added Delphi Form parser to examples, dfmparse.py, plus a couple of
-  sample Delphi forms as tests.  (Well done, Dang!)
-
-- Another performance speedup, 5-10%, inspired by Dang!  Plus about a 20%
-  speedup, by pre-constructing and cacheing exception objects instead of
-  constructing them on the fly.
-
-- Fixed minor bug when specifying oneOf() with 'caseless=True'.
-
-- Cleaned up and added a few more docstrings, to improve the generated docs.
-
-
-Version 1.1.2 - 21 Mar 2004
----------------------------
-- Fixed minor bug in scanString(), so that start location is at the start of
-  the matched tokens, not at the start of the whitespace before the matched
-  tokens.
-
-- Inclusion of HTML documentation, generated using Epydoc.  Reformatted some
-  doc strings to better generate readable docs. (Beautiful work, Ed Loper,
-  thanks for Epydoc!)
-
-- Minor performance speedup, 5-15%
-
-- And on a process note, I've used the unittest module to define a series of
-  unit tests, to help avoid the embarrassment of the version 1.1 snafu.
-
-
-Version 1.1.1 - 6 Mar 2004
---------------------------
-- Fixed critical bug introduced in 1.1, which broke MatchFirst(!) token
-  matching.
-  **THANK YOU, SEO SANGHYEON!!!**
-
-- Added "from future import __generators__" to permit running under
-  pre-Python 2.3.
-
-- Added example getNTPservers.py, showing how to use pyparsing to extract
-  a text pattern from the HTML of a web page.
-
-
-Version 1.1 - 3 Mar 2004
--------------------------
-- ***Changed API*** - While testing out parse actions, I found that the value
-  of loc passed in was not the starting location of the matched tokens, but
-  the location of the next token in the list.  With this version, the location
-  passed to the parse action is now the starting location of the tokens that
-  matched.
-
-  A second part of this change is that the return value of parse actions no
-  longer needs to return a tuple containing both the location and the parsed
-  tokens (which may optionally be modified); parse actions only need to return
-  the list of tokens.  Parse actions that return a tuple are deprecated; they
-  will still work properly for conversion/compatibility, but this behavior will
-  be removed in a future version.
-
-- Added validate() method, to help diagnose infinite recursion in a grammar tree.
-  validate() is not 100% fool-proof, but it can help track down nasty infinite
-  looping due to recursively referencing the same grammar construct without some
-  intervening characters.
-
-- Cleaned up default listing of some parse element types, to more closely match
-  ordinary BNF.  Instead of the form <classname>:[contents-list], some changes
-  are:
-  . And(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 token2 token3 }"
-  . Or(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 ^ token2 ^ token3 }"
-  . MatchFirst(token1,token2,token3) is "{ token1 | token2 | token3 }"
-  . Optional(token) is "[ token ]"
-  . OneOrMore(token) is "{ token }..."
-  . ZeroOrMore(token) is "[ token ]..."
-
-- Fixed an infinite loop in oneOf if the input string contains a duplicated
-  option. (Thanks Brad Clements)
-
-- Fixed a bug when specifying a results name on an Optional token. (Thanks
-  again, Brad Clements)
-
-- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0.6 when I converted quotedString to use
-  CharsNotIn; I accidentally permitted quoted strings to span newlines.  I have
-  fixed this in this version to go back to the original behavior, in which
-  quoted strings do *not* span newlines.
-
-- Fixed minor bug in HTTP server log parser. (Thanks Jim Richardson)
-
-
-Version 1.0.6 -  13 Feb 2004
-----------------------------
-- Added CharsNotIn class (Thanks, Lee SangYeong).  This is the opposite of
-  Word, in that it is constructed with a set of characters *not* to be matched.
-  (This enhancement also allowed me to clean up and simplify some of the
-  definitions for quoted strings, cStyleComment, and restOfLine.)
-
-- **MINOR API CHANGE** - Added joinString argument to the __init__ method of
-  Combine (Thanks, Thomas Kalka).  joinString defaults to "", but some
-  applications might choose some other string to use instead, such as a blank
-  or newline.  joinString was inserted as the second argument to __init__,
-  so if you have code that specifies an adjacent value, without using
-  'adjacent=', this code will break.
-
-- Modified LineStart to recognize the start of an empty line.
-
-- Added optional caseless flag to oneOf(), to create a list of CaselessLiteral
-  tokens instead of Literal tokens.
-
-- Added some enhancements to the SQL example:
-  . Oracle-style comments (Thanks to Harald Armin Massa)
-  . simple WHERE clause
-
-- Minor performance speedup - 5-15%
-
-
-Version 1.0.5 -  19 Jan 2004
-----------------------------
-- Added scanString() generator method to ParseElement, to support regex-like
-  pattern-searching
-
-- Added items() list to ParseResults, to return named results as a
-  list of (key,value) pairs
-
-- Fixed memory overflow in asList() for deeply nested ParseResults (Thanks,
-  Sverrir Valgeirsson)
-
-- Minor performance speedup - 10-15%
-
-
-Version 1.0.4 -  8 Jan 2004
----------------------------
-- Added positional tokens StringStart, StringEnd, LineStart, and LineEnd
-
-- Added commaSeparatedList to pre-defined global token definitions; also added
-  commasep.py to the examples directory, to demonstrate the differences between
-  parsing comma-separated data and simple line-splitting at commas
-
-- Minor API change: delimitedList does not automatically enclose the
-  list elements in a Group, but makes this the responsibility of the caller;
-  also, if invoked using 'combine=True', the list delimiters are also included
-  in the returned text (good for scoped variables, such as a.b.c or a::b::c, or
-  for directory paths such as a/b/c)
-
-- Performance speed-up again, 30-40%
-
-- Added httpServerLogParser.py to examples directory, as this is
-  a common parsing task
-
-
-Version 1.0.3 - 23 Dec 2003
----------------------------
-- Performance speed-up again, 20-40%
-
-- Added Python distutils installation setup.py, etc. (thanks, Dave Kuhlman)
-
-
-Version 1.0.2 - 18 Dec 2003
----------------------------
-- **NOTE: Changed API again!!!** (for the last time, I hope)
-
-  + Renamed module from parsing to pyparsing, to better reflect Python
-    linkage.
-
-- Also added dictExample.py to examples directory, to illustrate
-  usage of the Dict class.
-
-
-Version 1.0.1 - 17 Dec 2003
----------------------------
-- **NOTE:  Changed API!**
-
-  + Renamed 'len' argument on Word.__init__() to 'exact'
-
-- Performance speed-up, 10-30%
-
-
-Version 1.0.0 - 15 Dec 2003
----------------------------
-- Initial public release
-
-Version 0.1.1 thru 0.1.17 - October-November, 2003
---------------------------------------------------
-- initial development iterations:
-    - added Dict, Group
-    - added helper methods oneOf, delimitedList
-    - added helpers quotedString (and double and single), restOfLine, cStyleComment
-    - added MatchFirst as an alternative to the slower Or
-    - added UML class diagram
-    - fixed various logic bugs

-<li>First define the tokens and patterns to be matched, and assign
-this to a program variable.  Optional results names or parsing

-the string to
-be parsed.  During the matching process, whitespace between
-tokens is skipped by default (although this can be changed).
-When token matches occur, any defined parse action methods are
-called.</li>
-<li>Process the parsed results, returned as a list of strings.

-<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage notes</a></h2>
-<ul>
-<li><p class="first">The pyparsing module can be used to interpret simple command
-strings or algebraic expressions, or can be used to extract data
-from text reports with complicated format and structure (&quot;screen
-or report scraping&quot;).  However, it is possible that your defined
-matching patterns may accept invalid inputs.  Use pyparsing to
-extract data from strings assumed to be well-formatted.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">To keep up the readability of your code, use <a class="reference internal" href="#operators">operators</a>  such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">|</span></tt>,
-<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~</span></tt> to combine expressions.  You can also combine
-string literals with ParseExpressions - they will be
-automatically converted to Literal objects.  For example:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-integer  = Word( nums )            # simple unsigned integer
-variable = Word( alphas, max=1 )   # single letter variable, such as x, z, m, etc.
-arithOp  = Word( &quot;+-*/&quot;, max=1 )   # arithmetic operators
-equation = variable + &quot;=&quot; + integer + arithOp + integer    # will match &quot;x=2+2&quot;, etc.
-</pre>
-<p>In the definition of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">equation</span></tt>, the string <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;=&quot;</span></tt> will get added as
-a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Literal(&quot;=&quot;)</span></tt>, but in a more readable way.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">The pyparsing module's default behavior is to ignore whitespace.  This is the
-case for 99% of all parsers ever written.  This allows you to write simple, clean,
-grammars, such as the above <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">equation</span></tt>, without having to clutter it up with
-extraneous <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ws</span></tt> markers.  The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">equation</span></tt> grammar will successfully parse all of the
-following statements:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-x=2+2
-x = 2+2
-a = 10   *   4
-r= 1234/ 100000
-</pre>
-<p>Of course, it is quite simple to extend this example to support more elaborate expressions, with
-nesting with parentheses, floating point numbers, scientific notation, and named constants
-(such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">e</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pi</span></tt>).  See <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fourFn.py</span></tt>, included in the examples directory.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">To modify pyparsing's default whitespace skipping, you can use one or
-more of the following methods:</p>
-<ul>
-<li><p class="first">use the static method <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ParserElement.setDefaultWhitespaceChars</span></tt>
-to override the normal set of whitespace chars (' tn').  For instance
-when defining a grammar in which newlines are significant, you should
-call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ParserElement.setDefaultWhitespaceChars('</span> <span class="pre">\t')</span></tt> to remove
-newline from the set of skippable whitespace characters.  Calling
-this method will affect all pyparsing expressions defined afterward.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leaveWhitespace()</span></tt> on individual expressions, to suppress the
-skipping of whitespace before trying to match the expression</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Combine</span></tt> to require that successive expressions must be
-adjacent in the input string.  For instance, this expression:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-real = Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums)
-</pre>
-<p>will match &quot;3.14159&quot;, but will also match &quot;3 . 12&quot;.  It will also
-return the matched results as ['3', '.', '14159'].  By changing this
-expression to:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-real = Combine( Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums) )
-</pre>
-<p>it will not match numbers with embedded spaces, and it will return a
-single concatenated string '3.14159' as the parsed token.</p>
-</li>
-</ul>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">Repetition of expressions can be indicated using the '*' operator.  An
-expression may be multiplied by an integer value (to indicate an exact
-repetition count), or by a tuple containing
-two integers, or None and an integer, representing min and max repetitions
-(with None representing no min or no max, depending whether it is the first or
-second tuple element).  See the following examples, where n is used to
-indicate an integer value:</p>
-<ul class="simple">
-<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*3</span></tt> is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">expr</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">expr</span></tt></li>
-<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(2,3)</span></tt> is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">expr</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">Optional(expr)</span></tt></li>
-<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(n,None)</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(n,)</span></tt> is equivalent
-to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*n</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">ZeroOrMore(expr)</span></tt> (read as &quot;at least n instances of expr&quot;)</li>
-<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(None,n)</span></tt> is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(0,n)</span></tt>
-(read as &quot;0 to n instances of expr&quot;)</li>
-<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(None,None)</span></tt> is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ZeroOrMore(expr)</span></tt></li>
-<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(1,None)</span></tt> is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OneOrMore(expr)</span></tt></li>
-</ul>
-<p>Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(None,n)</span></tt> does not raise an exception if
-more than n exprs exist in the input stream; that is,
-<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(None,n)</span></tt> does not enforce a maximum number of expr
-occurrences.  If this behavior is desired, then write
-<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expr*(None,n)</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">~expr</span></tt>.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MatchFirst</span></tt> expressions are matched left-to-right, and the first
-match found will skip all later expressions within, so be sure
-to define less-specific patterns after more-specific patterns.
-If you are not sure which expressions are most specific, use Or
-expressions (defined using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">^</span></tt> operator) - they will always
-match the longest expression, although they are more
-compute-intensive.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Or</span></tt> expressions will evaluate all of the specified subexpressions
-to determine which is the &quot;best&quot; match, that is, which matches
-the longest string in the input data.  In case of a tie, the
-left-most expression in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Or</span></tt> list will win.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">If parsing the contents of an entire file, pass it to the
-<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parseFile</span></tt> method using:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-expr.parseFile( sourceFile )
-</pre>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ParseExceptions</span></tt> will report the location where an expected token
-or expression failed to match.  For example, if we tried to use our
-&quot;Hello, World!&quot; parser to parse &quot;Hello World!&quot; (leaving out the separating
-comma), we would get an exception, with the message:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-pyparsing.ParseException: Expected &quot;,&quot; (6), (1,7)
-</pre>
-<p>In the case of complex
-expressions, the reported location may not be exactly where you
-would expect.  See more information under <a class="reference internal" href="#parseexception">ParseException</a> .</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">Use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Group</span></tt> class to enclose logical groups of tokens within a
-sublist.  This will help organize your results into more
-hierarchical form (the default behavior is to return matching
-tokens as a flat list of matching input strings).</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">Punctuation may be significant for matching, but is rarely of
-much interest in the parsed results.  Use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suppress()</span></tt> method
-to keep these tokens from cluttering up your returned lists of
-tokens.  For example, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">delimitedList()</span></tt> matches a succession of
-one or more expressions, separated by delimiters (commas by
-default), but only returns a list of the actual expressions -
-the delimiters are used for parsing, but are suppressed from the
-returned output.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">Parse actions can be used to convert values from strings to
-other data types (ints, floats, booleans, etc.).</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">Results names are recommended for retrieving tokens from complex
-expressions.  It is much easier to access a token using its field
-name than using a positional index, especially if the expression
-contains optional elements.  You can also shortcut
-the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setResultsName</span></tt> call:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-stats = &quot;AVE:&quot; + realNum.setResultsName(&quot;average&quot;) + \
-        &quot;MIN:&quot; + realNum.setResultsName(&quot;min&quot;) + \
-        &quot;MAX:&quot; + realNum.setResultsName(&quot;max&quot;)
-</pre>
-<p>can now be written as this:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-stats = &quot;AVE:&quot; + realNum(&quot;average&quot;) + \
-        &quot;MIN:&quot; + realNum(&quot;min&quot;) + \
-        &quot;MAX:&quot; + realNum(&quot;max&quot;)
-</pre>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">Be careful when defining parse actions that modify global variables or
-data structures (as in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fourFn.py</span></tt>), especially for low level tokens
-or expressions that may occur within an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">And</span></tt> expression; an early element
-of an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">And</span></tt> may match, but the overall expression may fail.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first">Performance of pyparsing may be slow for complex grammars and/or large
-input strings.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/">psyco</a> package can be used to improve the speed of the

-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dictOf(</span> <span class="pre">key,</span> <span class="pre">value</span> <span class="pre">)</span></tt> - convenience function for quickly declaring a
-dictionary pattern of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dict(</span> <span class="pre">ZeroOrMore(</span> <span class="pre">Group(</span> <span class="pre">key</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">value</span> <span class="pre">)</span> <span class="pre">)</span> <span class="pre">)</span></tt>.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makeHTMLTags(</span> <span class="pre">tagName</span> <span class="pre">)</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makeXMLTags(</span> <span class="pre">tagName</span> <span class="pre">)</span></tt> - convenience
-functions to create definitions of opening and closing tag expressions.  Returns
-a pair of expressions, for the corresponding &lt;tag&gt; and &lt;/tag&gt; strings.  Includes
-support for attributes in the opening tag, such as &lt;tag attr1=&quot;abc&quot;&gt; - attributes
-are returned as keyed tokens in the returned ParseResults.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makeHTMLTags</span></tt> is less
-restrictive than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makeXMLTags</span></tt>, especially with respect to case sensitivity.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">operatorPrecedence(baseOperand,</span> <span class="pre">operatorList)</span></tt> - convenience function to define a
-grammar for parsing
-expressions with a hierarchical precedence of operators. To use the operatorPrecedence
-helper:</p>
-<ol class="arabic simple">
-<li>Define the base &quot;atom&quot; operand term of the grammar.
-For this simple grammar, the smallest operand is either
-and integer or a variable.  This will be the first argument
-to the operatorPrecedence method.</li>
-<li>Define a list of tuples for each level of operator
-precendence.  Each tuple is of the form
-<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(opExpr,</span> <span class="pre">numTerms,</span> <span class="pre">rightLeftAssoc,</span> <span class="pre">parseAction)</span></tt>, where:<ul>
-<li>opExpr is the pyparsing expression for the operator;
-may also be a string, which will be converted to a Literal; if
-None, indicates an empty operator, such as the implied
-multiplication operation between 'm' and 'x' in &quot;y = mx + b&quot;.</li>
-<li>numTerms is the number of terms for this operator (must
-be 1 or 2)</li>
-<li>rightLeftAssoc is the indicator whether the operator is
-right or left associative, using the pyparsing-defined
-constants <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">opAssoc.RIGHT</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">opAssoc.LEFT</span></tt>.</li>
-<li>parseAction is the parse action to be associated with
-expressions matching this operator expression (the
-parse action tuple member may be omitted)</li>
-</ul>
-</li>
-<li>Call operatorPrecedence passing the operand expression and
-the operator precedence list, and save the returned value
-as the generated pyparsing expression.  You can then use
-this expression to parse input strings, or incorporate it
-into a larger, more complex grammar.</li>
-</ol>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">matchPreviousLiteral</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">matchPreviousExpr</span></tt> - function to define and
-expression that matches the same content
-as was parsed in a previous parse expression.  For instance:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-first = Word(nums)
-matchExpr = first + &quot;:&quot; + matchPreviousLiteral(first)
-</pre>
-<p>will match &quot;1:1&quot;, but not &quot;1:2&quot;.  Since this matches at the literal
-level, this will also match the leading &quot;1:1&quot; in &quot;1:10&quot;.</p>
-<p>In contrast:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-first = Word(nums)
-matchExpr = first + &quot;:&quot; + matchPreviousExpr(first)
-</pre>
-<p>will <em>not</em> match the leading &quot;1:1&quot; in &quot;1:10&quot;; the expressions are
-evaluated first, and then compared, so &quot;1&quot; is compared with &quot;10&quot;.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nestedExpr(opener,</span> <span class="pre">closer,</span> <span class="pre">content=None,</span> <span class="pre">ignoreExpr=quotedString)</span></tt> - method for defining nested
-lists enclosed in opening and closing delimiters.</p>
-<ul class="simple">
-<li>opener - opening character for a nested list (default=&quot;(&quot;); can also be a pyparsing expression</li>
-<li>closer - closing character for a nested list (default=&quot;)&quot;); can also be a pyparsing expression</li>
-<li>content - expression for items within the nested lists (default=None)</li>
-<li>ignoreExpr - expression for ignoring opening and closing delimiters (default=quotedString)</li>
-</ul>
-<p>If an expression is not provided for the content argument, the nested
-expression will capture all whitespace-delimited content between delimiters
-as a list of separate values.</p>
-<p>Use the ignoreExpr argument to define expressions that may contain
-opening or closing characters that should not be treated as opening
-or closing characters for nesting, such as quotedString or a comment
-expression.  Specify multiple expressions using an Or or MatchFirst.
-The default is quotedString, but if no expressions are to be ignored,
-then pass None for this argument.</p>
-</li>
-<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">indentedBlock(</span> <span class="pre">statementExpr,</span> <span class="pre">indentationStackVar,</span> <span class="pre">indent=True)</span></tt> -
-function to define an indented block of statements, similar to
-indentation-based blocking in Python source code:</p>
-<ul class="simple">
-<li>statementExpr is the expression defining a statement that
-will be found in the indented block; a valid indentedBlock
-must contain at least 1 matching statementExpr</li>
-<li>indentationStackVar is a Python list variable; this variable
-should be common to all <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">indentedBlock</span></tt> expressions defined
-within the same grammar, and should be reinitialized to [1]
-each time the grammar is to be used</li>
-<li>indent is a boolean flag indicating whether the expressions
-within the block must be indented from the current parse
-location; if using indentedBlock to define the left-most
-statements (all starting in column 1), set indent to False</li>
-</ul>
-</li>

-token processing or conversion done by the contained expression.  For instance, the following expression:</p>
-<pre class="literal-block">
-fullName = Word(alphas) + Word(alphas)
-</pre>
-<p>will return the parse of &quot;John Smith&quot; as ['John', 'Smith'].  In some applications, the actual name as it
-was given in the input string is what is desired.  To do this, use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">originalTextFor</span></tt>:</p>

-====================================
-PyParsing -- A Python Parsing Module
-====================================
-
-Introduction
-============
-
-The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and executing 
-simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the use of 
-regular expressions.  The pyparsing module provides a library of classes 
-that client code uses to construct the grammar directly in Python code.
-
-Here is a program to parse "Hello, World!" (or any greeting of the form 
-"<salutation>, <addressee>!"):
-
-    from pyparsing import Word, alphas
-    greet = Word( alphas ) + "," + Word( alphas ) + "!"
-    hello = "Hello, World!"
-    print hello, "->", greet.parseString( hello )
-
-The program outputs the following:
-
-    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']
-
-The Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the 
-self-explanatory class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operator 
-definitions.
-
-The parsed results returned from parseString() can be accessed as a 
-nested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.
-
-The pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically 
-vexing when writing text parsers:
-- extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle 
-  "Hello,World!", "Hello  ,  World  !", etc.)
-- quoted strings
-- embedded comments
-
-The .zip file includes examples of a simple SQL parser, simple CORBA IDL 
-parser, a config file parser, a chemical formula parser, and a four-
-function algebraic notation parser.  It also includes a simple how-to 
-document, and a UML class diagram of the library's classes.
-
-
-
-Installation
-============
-
-Do the usual:
-
-    python setup.py install
-    
-(pyparsing requires Python 2.3.2 or later.)

-"""
-Purpose:   Linear Algebra Parser
-Based on:  SimpleCalc.py example (author Paul McGuire) in pyparsing-1.3.3
-Author:    Mike Ellis
-Copyright: Ellis & Grant, Inc. 2005
-License:   You may freely use, modify, and distribute this software.
-Warranty:  THIS SOFTWARE HAS NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
-Notes: Parses infix linear algebra (LA) notation for vectors, matrices, and scalars.
-       Output is C code function calls.  The parser can be run as an interactive 
-       interpreter or included as module to use for in-place substitution into C files 
-       containing LA equations.  
-
-       Supported operations are:
-       OPERATION:              INPUT                    OUTPUT
-       Scalar addition:        "a = b+c"                "a=(b+c)"
-       Scalar subtraction:     "a = b-c"                "a=(b-c)"
-       Scalar multiplication:  "a = b*c"                "a=b*c"
-       Scalar division:        "a = b/c"                "a=b/c"
-       Scalar exponentiation:  "a = b^c"                "a=pow(b,c)"
-       Vector scaling:         "V3_a = V3_b * c"        "vCopy(a,vScale(b,c))"
-       Vector addition:        "V3_a = V3_b + V3_c"     "vCopy(a,vAdd(b,c))"
-       Vector subtraction:     "V3_a = V3_b - V3_c"     "vCopy(a,vSubtract(b,c))"
-       Vector dot product:     "a = V3_b * V3_c"        "a=vDot(b,c)"
-       Vector outer product:   "M3_a = V3_b @ V3_c"     "a=vOuterProduct(b,c)"
-       Vector magn. squared:   "a = V3_b^Mag2"          "a=vMagnitude2(b)"
-       Vector magnitude:       "a = V3_b^Mag"           "a=sqrt(vMagnitude2(b))"
-       Matrix scaling:         "M3_a = M3_b * c"        "mCopy(a,mScale(b,c))"
-       Matrix addition:        "M3_a = M3_b + M3_c"     "mCopy(a,mAdd(b,c))"
-       Matrix subtraction:     "M3_a = M3_b - M3_c"     "mCopy(a,mSubtract(b,c))"
-       Matrix multiplication:  "M3_a = M3_b * M3_c"     "mCopy(a,mMultiply(b,c))"
-       Matrix by vector mult.: "V3_a = M3_b * V3_c"     "vCopy(a,mvMultiply(b,c))"
-       Matrix inversion:       "M3_a = M3_b^-1"         "mCopy(a,mInverse(b))"
-       Matrix transpose:       "M3_a = M3_b^T"          "mCopy(a,mTranspose(b))"
-       Matrix determinant:     "a = M3_b^Det"           "a=mDeterminant(b)"
-
-       The parser requires the expression to be an equation.  Each non-scalar variable
-       must be prefixed with a type tag, 'M3_' for 3x3 matrices and 'V3_' for 3-vectors. 
-       For proper compilation of the C code, the variables need to be declared without 
-       the prefix as float[3] for vectors and float[3][3] for matrices. The operations do
-       not modify any variables on the right-hand side of the equation.
-
-       Equations may include nested expressions within parentheses. The allowed binary 
-       operators are '+-*/^' for scalars, and '+-*^@' for vectors and matrices with the
-       meanings defined in the table above.
-
-       Specifying an improper combination of operands, e.g. adding a vector to a matrix,
-       is detected by the parser and results in a Python TypeError Exception. The usual cause
-       of this is omitting one or more tag prefixes. The parser knows nothing about a 
-       a variable's C declaration and relies entirely on the type tags. Errors in C 
-       declarations are not caught until compile time.
-
-Usage: To process LA equations embedded in source files, import this module and 
-       pass input and output file objects to the fprocess() function.  You can
-       can also invoke the parser from the command line, e.g. 'python LAparser.py',
-       to run a small test suite and enter an interactive loop where you can enter
-       LA equations and see the resulting C code.

-## 'a + b*5' as input yields 'a + b*5' as output.  For vectors and matrices, the input is translated to

-## the appropriate prefix is placed on the outer function for removal later as the stack evaluation

-# TAP.py - TAP parser
-#
-# A pyparsing parser to process the output of the Perl
-#   "Test Anything Protocol"
-#   (http://search.cpan.org/~petdance/TAP-1.00/TAP.pm)
-#
-# TAP output lines are preceded or followed by a test number range:
-#   1..n
-# with 'n' TAP output lines.
-#
-# The general format of a TAP output line is:
-#   ok/not ok (required)
-#   Test number (recommended)
-#   Description (recommended)
-#   Directive (only when necessary)
-#
-# A TAP output line may also indicate abort of the test suit with the line:
-#   Bail out!
-# optionally followed by a reason for bailing

-"""Search query parser
-
-version 2006-03-09
-
-This search query parser uses the excellent Pyparsing module 
-(http://pyparsing.sourceforge.net/) to parse search queries by users.
-It handles:
-
-* 'and', 'or' and implicit 'and' operators;
-* parentheses;
-* quoted strings;
-* wildcards at the end of a search term (help*);
-
-Requirements:
-* Python
-* Pyparsing
-
-If you run this script, it will perform a number of tests. To use is as a
-module, you should use inheritance on the SearchQueryParser class and overwrite
-the Get... methods. The ParserTest class gives a very simple example of how this
-could work.

-NAME:

-
-SYNOPSIS:
-    sparser.py [options] filename
-
-DESCRIPTION:
-    The sparser.py script is a Specified PARSER.  It is unique (as far as I can
-    tell) because it doesn't care about the delimiter(s).  The user specifies
-    what is expected, and the order, for each line of text.  All of the heavy
-    lifting is handled by pyparsing (http://pyparsing.sf.net).
-
-OPTIONS:
-    -h,--help        this message
-    -v,--version     version
-    -d,--debug       turn on debug messages
-
-EXAMPLES:
-    1. As standalone
-        sparser.py myfile
-    2. As library

-    Bring data from text files into a program, optionally parsing each line
-    according to specifications in a parse definition file.
-
-    ParseFileLineByLine instances can be used like normal file objects (i.e. by
-    calling readline(), readlines(), and write()), but can also be used as
-    sequences of lines in for-loops.
-
-    ParseFileLineByLine objects also handle compression transparently. i.e. it
-    is possible to read lines from a compressed text file as if it were not
-    compressed.  Compression is deduced from the file name suffixes '.Z'
-    (compress/uncompress), '.gz' (gzip/gunzip), and '.bz2' (bzip2).
-
-    The parse definition file name is developed based on the input file name.
-    If the input file name is 'basename.ext', then the definition file is
-    'basename_def.ext'.  If a definition file specific to the input file is not
-    found, then the program searches for the file 'sparse.def' which would be
-    the definition file for all files in that directory without a file specific
-    definition file.
-
-    Finally, ParseFileLineByLine objects accept file names that start with '~'
-    or '~user' to indicate a home directory, as well as URLs (for reading
-    only).
-
-    Constructor: 
-    ParseFileLineByLine(|filename|, |mode|='"r"'), where |filename| is the name
-    of the file (or a URL) and |mode| is one of '"r"' (read), '"w"' (write) or

-"""
-NUMBER A simple integer type that's just any series of digits. 
-FLOAT A simple floating point type. 
-STRING A string is double quotes with anything inside that's not a " or 
-    newline character. You can include \n and \" to include these 
-    characters. 
-MARK Marks a point in the stack that demarcates the boundary for a nested 
-    group. 
-WORD Marks the root node of a group, with the other end being the nearest 
-    MARK. 
-GROUP Acts as the root node of an anonymous group. 
-ATTRIBUTE Assigns an attribute name to the previously processed node. 
-    This means that just about anything can be an attribute, unlike in XML. 
-BLOB A BLOB is unique to Stackish and allows you to record any content 
-    (even binary content) inside the structure. This is done by pre-
-    sizing the data with the NUMBER similar to Dan Bernstein's netstrings 
-    setup. 
-SPACE White space is basically ignored. This is interesting because since 
-    Stackish is serialized consistently this means you can use \n as the 
-    separation character and perform reasonable diffs on two structures.

-<h1 class="epydoc"> API Documentation </h1>
-
-<p> This document contains the API (Application Programming Interface)
-documentation for pyparsing.  Documentation for the Python
-objects defined by the project is divided into separate pages for each
-package, module, and class.  The API documentation also includes two
-pages containing information about the project as a whole: a trees
-page, and an index page.  </p>
-
-<h2> Object Documentation </h2>
-
-  <p>Each <strong>Package Documentation</strong> page contains: </p>
-  <ul>
-    <li> A description of the package. </li>
-    <li> A list of the modules and sub-packages contained by the
-    package.  </li>
-    <li> A summary of the classes defined by the package. </li>
-    <li> A summary of the functions defined by the package. </li>
-    <li> A summary of the variables defined by the package. </li>
-    <li> A detailed description of each function defined by the
-    package. </li>
-    <li> A detailed description of each variable defined by the
-    package. </li>
-  </ul>
-  
-  <p>Each <strong>Module Documentation</strong> page contains:</p>
-  <ul>
-    <li> A description of the module. </li>
-    <li> A summary of the classes defined by the module. </li>
-    <li> A summary of the functions defined by the module. </li>
-    <li> A summary of the variables defined by the module. </li>
-    <li> A detailed description of each function defined by the
-    module. </li>
-    <li> A detailed description of each variable defined by the
-    module. </li>
-  </ul>
-  
-  <p>Each <strong>Class Documentation</strong> page contains: </p>
-  <ul>
-    <li> A class inheritance diagram. </li>
-    <li> A list of known subclasses. </li>
-    <li> A description of the class. </li>
-    <li> A summary of the methods defined by the class. </li>
-    <li> A summary of the instance variables defined by the class. </li>
-    <li> A summary of the class (static) variables defined by the
-    class. </li> 
-    <li> A detailed description of each method defined by the
-    class. </li>
-    <li> A detailed description of each instance variable defined by the
-    class. </li> 
-    <li> A detailed description of each class (static) variable defined
-    by the class. </li> 
-  </ul>
-
-<h2> Project Documentation </h2>
-
-  <p> The <strong>Trees</strong> page contains the module and class hierarchies: </p>
-  <ul>
-    <li> The <em>module hierarchy</em> lists every package and module, with
-    modules grouped into packages.  At the top level, and within each
-    package, modules and sub-packages are listed alphabetically. </li>
-    <li> The <em>class hierarchy</em> lists every class, grouped by base
-    class.  If a class has more than one base class, then it will be
-    listed under each base class.  At the top level, and under each base
-    class, classes are listed alphabetically. </li>
-  </ul>
-  
-  <p> The <strong>Index</strong> page contains indices of terms and
-  identifiers: </p>
-  <ul>
-    <li> The <em>term index</em> lists every term indexed by any object's
-    documentation.  For each term, the index provides links to each
-    place where the term is indexed. </li>
-    <li> The <em>identifier index</em> lists the (short) name of every package,
-    module, class, method, function, variable, and parameter.  For each
-    identifier, the index provides a short description, and a link to
-    its documentation. </li>
-  </ul>
-
-<h2> The Table of Contents </h2>
-
-<p> The table of contents occupies the two frames on the left side of
-the window.  The upper-left frame displays the <em>project
-contents</em>, and the lower-left frame displays the <em>module
-contents</em>: </p>
-
-<table class="help summary" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
-  <tr style="height: 30%">
-    <td align="center" style="font-size: small">
-       Project<br />Contents<hr />...</td>
-    <td align="center" style="font-size: small" rowspan="2" width="70%">
-      API<br />Documentation<br />Frame<br /><br /><br />
-    </td>
-  </tr>
-  <tr>
-    <td align="center" style="font-size: small">
-      Module<br />Contents<hr />&nbsp;<br />...<br />&nbsp;
-    </td>
-  </tr>
-</table><br />
-
-<p> The <strong>project contents frame</strong> contains a list of all packages
-and modules that are defined by the project.  Clicking on an entry
-will display its contents in the module contents frame.  Clicking on a
-special entry, labeled "Everything," will display the contents of
-the entire project. </p>
-
-<p> The <strong>module contents frame</strong> contains a list of every
-submodule, class, type, exception, function, and variable defined by a
-module or package.  Clicking on an entry will display its
-documentation in the API documentation frame.  Clicking on the name of
-the module, at the top of the frame, will display the documentation
-for the module itself. </p>
-
-<p> The "<strong>frames</strong>" and "<strong>no frames</strong>" buttons below the top
-navigation bar can be used to control whether the table of contents is
-displayed or not. </p>
-
-<h2> The Navigation Bar </h2>
-
-<p> A navigation bar is located at the top and bottom of every page.
-It indicates what type of page you are currently viewing, and allows
-you to go to related pages.  The following table describes the labels
-on the navigation bar.  Note that not some labels (such as
-[Parent]) are not displayed on all pages. </p>
-
-<table class="summary" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
-<tr class="summary">
-  <th>Label</th>
-  <th>Highlighted when...</th>
-  <th>Links to...</th>
-</tr>
-  <tr><td valign="top"><strong>[Parent]</strong></td>
-      <td valign="top"><em>(never highlighted)</em></td>
-      <td valign="top"> the parent of the current package </td></tr>
-  <tr><td valign="top"><strong>[Package]</strong></td>
-      <td valign="top">viewing a package</td>
-      <td valign="top">the package containing the current object
-      </td></tr>
-  <tr><td valign="top"><strong>[Module]</strong></td>
-      <td valign="top">viewing a module</td>
-      <td valign="top">the module containing the current object

-  <tr><td valign="top"><strong>[Help]</strong></td>
-      <td valign="top">viewing the help page</td>
-      <td valign="top"> the help page </td></tr>
-</table>
-
-<p> The "<strong>show private</strong>" and "<strong>hide private</strong>" buttons below
-the top navigation bar can be used to control whether documentation
-for private objects is displayed.  Private objects are usually defined
-as objects whose (short) names begin with a single underscore, but do
-not end with an underscore.  For example, "<code>_x</code>",
-"<code>__pprint</code>", and "<code>epydoc.epytext._tokenize</code>"
-are private objects; but "<code>re.sub</code>",
-"<code>__init__</code>", and "<code>type_</code>" are not.  However,
-if a module defines the "<code>__all__</code>" variable, then its
-contents are used to decide which objects are private. </p>
-
-<p> A timestamp below the bottom navigation bar indicates when each
-page was last updated. </p>

-<h1 class="epydoc">Module pyparsing</h1><p class="nomargin-top"><span class="codelink"><a href="pyparsing.pyparsing-pysrc.html">source&nbsp;code</a></span></p>
-<p>pyparsing module - Classes and methods to define and execute parsing 
-  grammars</p>
-  <p>The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and 
-  executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the 
-  use of regular expressions.  With pyparsing, you don't need to learn a 
-  new syntax for defining grammars or matching expressions - the parsing 
-  module provides a library of classes that you use to construct the 
-  grammar directly in Python.</p>
-  <p>Here is a program to parse &quot;Hello, World!&quot; (or any greeting 
-  of the form &quot;&lt;salutation&gt;, &lt;addressee&gt;!&quot;):</p>
-<pre class="literalblock">
-   from pyparsing import Word, alphas
-
-   # define grammar of a greeting
-   greet = Word( alphas ) + &quot;,&quot; + Word( alphas ) + &quot;!&quot;
-
-   hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
-   print hello, &quot;-&gt;&quot;, greet.parseString( hello )
-</pre>
-  <p>The program outputs the following:</p>
-<pre class="literalblock">
-   Hello, World! -&gt; ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']
-</pre>
-  <p>The Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to 
-  the self-explanatory class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' 
-  operators.</p>
-  <p>The parsed results returned from parseString() can be accessed as a 
-  nested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.</p>
-  <p>The pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically 
-  vexing when writing text parsers:</p>
-  <ul>
-    <li>
-      extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle 
-      &quot;Hello,World!&quot;, &quot;Hello  ,  World  !&quot;, etc.)
-    </li>
-    <li>
-      quoted strings
-    </li>
-    <li>
-      embedded comments
-    </li>
-  </ul>

-  <p>Helper method for defining nested lists enclosed in opening and 
-  closing delimiters (&quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; are the default).</p>
-  <p>Parameters:</p>
-  <ul>
-    <li>
-      opener - opening character for a nested list (default=&quot;(&quot;);
-      can also be a pyparsing expression
-    </li>
-    <li>
-      closer - closing character for a nested list (default=&quot;)&quot;);
-      can also be a pyparsing expression
-    </li>
-    <li>
-      content - expression for items within the nested lists (default=None)
-    </li>
-    <li>
-      ignoreExpr - expression for ignoring opening and closing delimiters 
-      (default=quotedString)
-    </li>
-  </ul>
-  <p>If an expression is not provided for the content argument, the nested 
-  expression will capture all whitespace-delimited content between 
-  delimiters as a list of separate values.</p>
-  <p>Use the ignoreExpr argument to define expressions that may contain 
-  opening or closing characters that should not be treated as opening or 
-  closing characters for nesting, such as quotedString or a comment 
-  expression.  Specify multiple expressions using an Or or MatchFirst. The 
-  default is quotedString, but if no expressions are to be ignored, then 
-  pass None for this argument.</p>

-<p>Forward declaration of an expression to be defined later - used for 
-  recursive grammars, such as algebraic infix notation. When the expression
-  is known, it is assigned to the Forward variable using the '&lt;&lt;' 
-  operator.</p>
-  <p>Note: take care when assigning to Forward not to overlook precedence 
-  of operators. Specifically, '|' has a lower precedence than '&lt;&lt;', 
-  so that:</p>
-<pre class="literalblock">
-  fwdExpr &lt;&lt; a | b | c
-</pre>
-  <p>will actually be evaluated as:</p>
-<pre class="literalblock">
-  (fwdExpr &lt;&lt; a) | b | c
-</pre>
-  <p>thereby leaving b and c out as parseable alternatives.  It is 
-  recommended that you explicitly group the values inserted into the 
-  Forward:</p>
-<pre class="literalblock">

-  value, instead of re-executing parsing/validating code.  Memoizing is

-  <p>This speedup may break existing programs that use parse actions that 
-  have side-effects.  For this reason, packrat parsing is disabled when you
-  first import pyparsing.  To activate the packrat feature, your program 
-  must call the class method ParserElement.enablePackrat().  If your 
-  program uses psyco to &quot;compile as you go&quot;, you must call 
-  enablePackrat before calling psyco.full().  If you do not do this, Python
-  will crash.  For best results, call enablePackrat() immediately after 
-  importing pyparsing.</p>

-<p>Special matching class for matching whitespace.  Normally, whitespace 
-  is ignored by pyparsing grammars.  This class is included when some 
-  whitespace structures are significant.  Define with a string containing 
-  the whitespace characters to be matched; default is &quot; \t\r\n&quot;.
-  Also takes optional min, max, and exact arguments, as defined for the 
-  Word class.</p>

-pyparsing module - Classes and methods to define and execute parsing grammars
-
-The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and executing simple grammars,
-vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the use of regular expressions.  With pyparsing, you
-don't need to learn a new syntax for defining grammars or matching expressions - the parsing module
-provides a library of classes that you use to construct the grammar directly in Python.
-
-Here is a program to parse "Hello, World!" (or any greeting of the form "<salutation>, <addressee>!")::
-
-    from pyparsing import Word, alphas
-
-    # define grammar of a greeting
-    greet = Word( alphas ) + "," + Word( alphas ) + "!"
-
-    hello = "Hello, World!"
-    print hello, "->", greet.parseString( hello )
-
-The program outputs the following::
-
-    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']
-
-The Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the self-explanatory
-class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operators.
-
-The parsed results returned from parseString() can be accessed as a nested list, a dictionary, or an
-object with named attributes.
-
-The pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically vexing when writing text parsers:
- - extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle "Hello,World!", "Hello  ,  World  !", etc.)
- - quoted strings
- - embedded comments

-pyparsing module - Classes and methods to define and execute parsing grammars
-
-The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and executing simple grammars,
-vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the use of regular expressions.  With pyparsing, you
-don't need to learn a new syntax for defining grammars or matching expressions - the parsing module
-provides a library of classes that you use to construct the grammar directly in Python.
-
-Here is a program to parse "Hello, World!" (or any greeting of the form "<salutation>, <addressee>!")::
-
-    from pyparsing_py3 import Word, alphas
-
-    # define grammar of a greeting
-    greet = Word( alphas ) + "," + Word( alphas ) + "!"
-
-    hello = "Hello, World!"
-    print hello, "->", greet.parseString( hello )
-
-The program outputs the following::
-
-    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']
-
-The Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the self-explanatory
-class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operators.
-
-The parsed results returned from parseString() can be accessed as a nested list, a dictionary, or an
-object with named attributes.
-
-The pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically vexing when writing text parsers:
- - extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle "Hello,World!", "Hello  ,  World  !", etc.)
- - quoted strings
- - embedded comments
