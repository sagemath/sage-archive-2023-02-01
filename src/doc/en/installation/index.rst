Welcome to the Sage Installation Guide
======================================

You can install Sage either from a pre-built binary tarball or from its sources.

Installing Sage from **pre-build binaries** is the fastest method, with fewest
prerequisites. Choose it for your first Sage install.

By compiling Sage from its **sources** you run a slightly more up-to-date
version. You can also modify it and contribute back to the project. Compiling
Sage should be simpler than you're used to with most software, since much
testing is done on a wide range of computers.
