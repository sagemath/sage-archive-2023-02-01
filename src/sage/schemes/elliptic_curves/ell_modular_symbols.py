Modular symbols

To an elliptic curves `E` over the rational numbers one can associate
a space - or better two spaces - of modular symbols of level `N`,
equal to the conductor of `E`; because `E` is known to be modular.

There are two implementations of modular symbols, one within ``sage``
and the other as part of Cremona's ``eclib``. One can choose here which
one is used.

The normalisation of our modular symbols attached to `E` can be chosen, too.
For instance one can make it depended on `E` rather than on its
isogeny class. This is useful for `p`-adic L-functions.

For more details on modular symbols consult the following

        This function is use to set ``_scaling``, the factor used to adjust the
        scalar multiple of the modular symbol.
        If `[0]`, the modular symbol evaluated at 0, is non-zero, we can just scale
        it with respect to the approximation of the L-value. It is known that
        the quotient is a rational number with small denominator.
        Otherwise we try to scale using quadratic twists.

        ``_scaling`` will be set to a rational non-zero multiple if we succeed and to 1 otherwise.
        Even if we fail we scale at least to make up the difference between the periods
        of the `X_0`-optimal curve and our given curve `E` in the isogeny class.

        Modular symbols attached to `E` using ``sage``.

        INPUT:

        - ``E`` -- an elliptic curve
        - ``sign`` -- an integer, -1 or 1
        - ``normalize`` -- either 'L_ratio' (default), 'period', or 'none';
          For 'L_ratio', the modular symbol is correctly normalized
          by comparing it to the quotient of `L(E,1)` by the least
          positive period for the curve and some small twists.
          The normalization 'period' uses the integral_period_map
          for modular symbols and is known to be equal to the above
          normalization up to the sign and a possible power of 2.
          For 'none', the modular symbol is almost certainly
          not correctly normalized, i.e. all values will be a
          fixed scalar multiple of what they should be.  But
          the initial computation of the modular symbol is
          much faster, though evaluation of
          it after computing it won't be any faster.
