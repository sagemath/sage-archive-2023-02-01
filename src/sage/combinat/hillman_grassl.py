The Hillman-Grassl correspondence

This module implements weak reverse plane partitions and four
correspondences on them: the Hillman-Grassl correspondence and
its inverse, as well as the Sulzgruber correspondence and its
inverse (the Pak correspondence).

Fix a partition `\lambda`
(see :meth:`~sage.combinat.partition.Partition`).
We draw all partitions and tableaux in English notation.

A `\lambda`-*array* will mean a tableau of shape `\lambda` whose
entries are nonnegative integers. (No conditions on the order of
these entries are made. Note that `0` is allowed.)

A *weak reverse plane partition of shape* `\lambda` (short:
`\lambda`-*rpp*) will mean a `\lambda`-array whose entries weakly
increase along each row and weakly increase along each column.
(The name "weak reverse plane partition" comes from Stanley in
[EnumComb2]_ Section 7.22; other authors -- such as Pak
[Sulzgr2017]_, or Hillman and Grassl in [HilGra1976]_ -- just
call it a reverse plane partition.)

The Hillman-Grassl correspondence is a bijection from the
set of `\lambda`-arrays to the set of `\lambda`-rpps.
For its definition, see
:meth:`~sage.combinat.tableau.Tableau.hillman_grassl`;
for its inverse, see
:meth:`~sage.combinat.hillman_grassl.WeakReversePlanePartition.hillman_grassl_inverse`.

The Sulzgruber correspondence `\Phi_\lambda` and the Pak
correspondence `\xi_\lambda` are two further mutually
inverse bijections between the set of
`\lambda`-arrays and the set of `\lambda`-rpps.
They appear (sometimes with different definitions, but
defining the same maps) in [Pak2002]_, [Hopkins2017]_ and
[Sulzgr2017]_. For their definitions, see
:meth:`~sage.combinat.tableau.Tableau.sulzgruber_correspondence` and
:meth:`~sage.combinat.hillman_grassl.WeakReversePlanePartition.pak_correspondence`.

EXAMPLES:

We construct a `\lambda`-rpp for `\lambda = (3, 3, 1)`
(note that `\lambda` needs not be specified explicitly)::

    sage: p = WeakReversePlanePartition([[0, 1, 3], [2, 4, 4], [3]])
    sage: p.parent()
    Weak Reverse Plane Partitions

(This is the example in Section 7.22 of [EnumComb2]_.)

Next, we apply the inverse of the Hillman-Grassl correspondence
to it::

    sage: HGp = p.hillman_grassl_inverse(); HGp
    [[1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1]]
    sage: HGp.parent()
    Tableaux

This is a `\lambda`-array, encoded as a tableau. We can
recover our original `\lambda`-rpp from it using the
Hillman-Grassl correspondence::

    sage: HGp.hillman_grassl() == p
    True

We can also apply the Pak correspondence to our rpp::

    sage: Pp = p.pak_correspondence(); Pp
    [[2, 0, 1], [0, 2, 0], [1]]
    sage: Pp.parent()
    Tableaux

This is undone by the Sulzgruber correspondence::

    sage: Pp.sulzgruber_correspondence() == p
    True

These four correspondences can also be accessed as standalone
functions (:meth:`hillman_grassl_inverse`, :meth:`hillman_grassl`,
:meth:`pak_correspondence` and :meth:`sulzgruber_correspondence`)
that transform lists of lists into lists of lists;
this may be more efficient. For example, the above computation
of ``HGp`` can also be obtained as follows::

    sage: from sage.combinat.hillman_grassl import hillman_grassl_inverse
    sage: HGp_bare = hillman_grassl_inverse([[0, 1, 3], [2, 4, 4], [3]])
    sage: HGp_bare
    [[1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1]]
    sage: isinstance(HGp_bare, list)
    True

        :class:`~sage.combinat.tableau.Tableau`).

        Fix a partition `\lambda`
        (see :meth:`~sage.combinat.partition.Partition`).
        We draw all partitions and tableaux in English notation.

        A `\lambda`-*array* will mean a tableau of shape `\lambda` whose
        entries are nonnegative integers. (No conditions on the order of
        these entries are made. Note that `0` is allowed.)

        A *weak reverse plane partition of shape* `\lambda` (short:
        `\lambda`-*rpp*) will mean a `\lambda`-array whose entries weakly
        increase along each row and weakly increase along each column.

        The inverse `H^{-1}` of the Hillman-Grassl correspondence (see
        (:meth:`~sage.combinat.tableau.Tableau.hillman_grassl` for the
        latter) sends a `\lambda`-rpp `\pi` to a `\lambda`-array
        `H^{-1}(\pi)` constructed recursively as follows:

        * If all entries of `\pi` are `0`, then `H^{-1}(\pi) = \pi`.

        * Otherwise, let `s` be the index of the leftmost column of `\pi`
          containing a nonzero entry. Write the `\lambda`-array `M`
          as `(m_{i, j})`.

        * Define a sequence `((i_1, j_1), (i_2, j_2), \ldots,
          (i_n, j_n))` of boxes in the diagram of `\lambda` (actually a
          lattice path made of northward and eastward steps) as follows:
          Let `(i_1, j_1)` be the bottommost box in the `s`-th column
          of `\pi`.
          If `(i_k, j_k)` is defined for some `k \geq 1`, then
          `(i_{k+1}, j_{k+1})` is constructed as follows:
          If `q_{i_k - 1, j_k}` is well-defined and equals `q_{i_k, j_k}`,
          then we set `(i_{k+1}, j_{k+1}) = (i_k - 1, j_k)`. Otherwise,
          we set `(i_{k+1}, j_{k+1}) = (i_k, j_k + 1)` if this is still
          a box of `\lambda`. Otherwise, the sequence ends here.

        * Let `\pi'` be the `\lambda`-rpp obtained from `\pi` by
          subtracting `1` from the `(i_k, j_k)`-th entry of `\pi` for each
          `k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}`.

        * Let `N'` be the image `H^{-1}(\pi')` (which is already
          constructed by recursion).
          Then, `H^{-1}(\pi)` is obtained from `N'` by adding `1` to the
          `(i_n, s)`-th entry of `N'`.

        This construction appears in [HilGra1976]_ Section 6 (where
        `\lambda`-arrays are re-encoded as sequences of "hook number
        multiplicities") and [EnumComb2]_ Section 7.22.

        Return the image of the `\lambda`-rpp ``self`` under the Pak
        correspondence (as a :class:`~sage.combinat.tableau.Tableau`).

        See :mod:`~sage.combinat.hillman_grassl`.

        The Pak correspondence is the map `\xi_\lambda`
        from [Sulzgr2017]_ Section 7, and is the map
        `\xi_\lambda` from [Pak2002]_ Section 4.
        It is the inverse of the Sulzgruber correspondence
        (:meth:`sulzgruber_correspondence`).
        The following description of the Pak correspondence follows
        [Hopkins2017]_ (which denotes it by `\mathcal{RSK}^{-1}`):

        Fix a partition `\lambda`
        (see :meth:`~sage.combinat.partition.Partition`).
        We draw all partitions and tableaux in English notation.

        A `\lambda`-*array* will mean a tableau of shape `\lambda` whose
        entries are nonnegative integers. (No conditions on the order of
        these entries are made. Note that `0` is allowed.)

        A *weak reverse plane partition of shape* `\lambda` (short:
        `\lambda`-*rpp*) will mean a `\lambda`-array whose entries weakly
        increase along each row and weakly increase along each column.

        We shall also use the following notation:
        If `(u, v)` is a cell of `\lambda`, and if `\pi` is a
        `\lambda`-rpp, then:

        * the *lower bound* of `\pi` at `(u, v)` (denoted by
          `\pi_{<(u, v)}`) is defined to be
          `\max \{ \pi_{u-1, v} , \pi_{u, v-1} \}`
          (where `\pi_{0, v}` and `\pi_{u, 0}` are understood to
          mean `0`).

        * the *upper bound* of `\pi` at `(u, v)` (denoted by
          `\pi_{>(u, v)}`) is defined to be
          `\min \{ \pi_{u+1, v} , \pi_{u, v+1} \}`
          (where `\pi_{i, j}` is understood to mean `+ \infty`
          if `(i, j)` is not in `\lambda`; thus, the upper
          bound at a corner cell is `+ \infty`).

        * *toggling* `\pi` at `(u, v)` means replacing the entry
          `\pi_{u, v}` of `\pi` at `(u, v)` by
          `\pi_{<(u, v)} + \pi_{>(u, v)} - \pi_{u, v}`
          (this is well-defined as long as `(u, v)` is not a
          corner of `\lambda`).

        Note that every `\lambda`-rpp `\pi` and every cell
        `(u, v)` of `\lambda` satisfy
        `\pi_{<(u, v)} \leq \pi_{u, v} \leq \pi_{>(u, v)}`.
        Note that toggling a `\lambda`-rpp (at a cell that is not
        a corner) always results in a `\lambda`-rpp. Also,
        toggling is an involution).

        Note also that the lower bound of `\pi` at `(u, v)` is
        defined (and finite) even when `(u, v)` is not a cell of
        `\lambda`, as long as both `(u-1, v)` and `(u, v-1)` are
        cells of `\lambda`.

        The Pak correspondence `\Phi_\lambda` sends a `\lambda`-array
        `M = (m_{i, j})` to a `\lambda`-rpp `\Phi_\lambda(M)`. It
        is defined by recursion on `\lambda` (that is, we assume that
        `\Phi_\mu` is already defined for every partition `\mu`
        smaller than `\lambda`), and its definition proceeds as
        follows:

        * If `\lambda = \varnothing`, then `\Phi_\lambda` is the
          obvious bijection sending the only `\varnothing`-array
          to the only `\varnothing`-rpp.

        * Pick any corner `c = (i, j)` of `\lambda`, and let `\mu`
          be the result of removing this corner `c` from the partition
          `\lambda`. (The exact choice of `c` is immaterial.)

        * Let `M'` be what remains of `M` when the corner cell `c`
          is removed.

        * Let `\pi' = \Phi_\mu(M')`.

        * For each positive integer `k` such that `(i-k, j-k)` is a
          cell of `\lambda`, toggle `\pi'` at `(i-k, j-k)`.
          (All these togglings commute, so the order in which they
          are made is immaterial.)

        * Extend the `\mu`-rpp `\pi'` to a `\lambda`-rpp `\pi` by
          adding the cell `c` and writing the number
          `m_{i, j} - \pi'_{<(i, j)}` into this cell.

        * Set `\Phi_\lambda(M) = \pi`.

    Return the image of the `\lambda`-array ``M``

    The Hillman-Grassl correspondence is a bijection
    between the tableaux with nonnegative entries
    (otherwise arbitrary) and the weak reverse plane
    partitions with nonnegative entries.
    This bijection preserves the shape of the
    tableau. See :mod:`~sage.combinat.hillman_grassl`.
