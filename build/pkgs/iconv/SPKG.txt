== Description ==
GNU libiconv is a library that is used to enable different
languages, with different characters to be handled properly.

== License ==
 * GPL 3 and LGPL 3. So we can safely link against the library in Sage.

== SPKG Maintainers ==
 * David Kirkby

== Upstream Contact ==
 * http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
 * Bug reports to bug-gnu-libiconv@gnu.org

== Dependencies ==
 * None for the purposes of Sage, but in general gettext.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * None, other than anyone updating this package should be familiar with how
   to write shell scripts.

== Changelog ==

=== iconv-1.14 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 26 May 2013) ===
 * #14647: update to version 1.14.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p4 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 5 January 2013) ===
 * #13912: let iconv build on Cygwin without additional prereqs.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p3 (David Kirkby, August 10th, 2010) ===
 * Use '$MAKE' instead of 'make' in spkg-install and spkg-check to enable
   parallel builds, and allow the user to specify a different 'make' program.
 * Use CC="$CC $CFLAG64" instead of adding $CFLAG64 to CFLAGS. The latter
   caused problems on Solaris 10 x86 and an early version of OpenSolaris
   on x86. It was never a problem on recent versions of OpenSolaris, or
   Solaris 10 on SPARC. See #9718 for a discussion of this.
 * Changed the format of the tests in spkg-install and spkg-check to be a
   little clearer.
 * Added a few extra comments.
 * Removed code to remove old files, to avoid causing any confusion.
 * Quoted "$SAGE_LOCAL" where this had been omitted before.
 * Removed trailing white space on lines.
 * Removed a surplus ; in both spkg-check and spkg-install.
 * Added the "Upstream Contact" section to SPKG.txt.
 * Changed the "Special Update/Build Instructions" to be "none",
   as what was written before was confusing.
 * Install iconv on HP-UX in addition to the two platforms iconv was
   previously installed on (Solaris and Cygwin).
 * Additionally force 'make check' to execute on HP-UX, too.
 * No longer assume bash is in /bin, as it is not on HP-UX or AIX.
   Instead use "#!/usr/bin/env bash", as suggested in the Sage
   Developers Guide.
 * Consistently use "$UNAME" (which is set by 'sage-env') rather than
   `uname`. (Reviewer change. Also further cosmetic changes.)
 * Stylistic change: Use 'case' statements for $UNAME case distinctions
   rather than (nested) 'if's with or-lists of 'test' statements.
   (Reviewer change, too.)
 * All patches/changes made at #9603.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p2 (John Palmieri, March 31st 2010) ===
 * spkg-check: only run 'make check' on Solaris and Cygwin.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p1 (William Stein, March 31st 2010) ===
 * Really ensure iconv spkg only does something on Solaris and Cygwin.
   In particular, don't delete old versions thus breaking everybody's
   upgrades.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p0 (David Kirkby, March 21st 2010) ===
 * #8567 Ensure iconv only builds on Solaris and Cygwin as
   having two copies of iconv causes problems on some Linux systems.

=== iconv-1.13.1 (David Kirkby, February 13th 2010) ===
 * #8191 First release of libiconv, needed for R on Solaris
   and probably for Cygwin too (see #7319)
