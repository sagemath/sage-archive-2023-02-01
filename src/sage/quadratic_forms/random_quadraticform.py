def random_quadraticform(R, n, rand_arg_list=[]):
    r"""
    Create a random quadratic form in `n` variables defined over the ring `R`.

    The last (and optional) argument ``rand_arg_list`` is a list of at most 3
    elements which is passed (as at most 3 separate variables) into the method
    ``R.random_element()``.

    INPUT:

    - `R` -- a ring.
    - `n` -- an integer `\ge 0`
    - ``rand_arg_list`` -- a list of at most 3 arguments which can be taken by
      ``R.random_element()``.

    OUTPUT:

    A quadratic form over the ring `R`.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: random_quadraticform(ZZ, 3, [1,5])    # random
        Quadratic form in 3 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients:
        [ 3 2 3 ]
        [ * 1 4 ]
        [ * * 3 ]

        sage: random_quadraticform(ZZ, 3, [-5,5])    # random
        Quadratic form in 3 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients:
        [ 3 2 -5 ]
        [ * 2 -2 ]
        [ * * -5 ]

        sage: random_quadraticform(ZZ, 3, [-50,50])    # random
        Quadratic form in 3 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients:
        [ 1 8 -23 ]
        [ * 0 0 ]
        [ * * 6 ]
