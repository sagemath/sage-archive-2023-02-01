Rings

This module provides the abstract base class :class:`Ring` from which
all rings in Sage (used to) derive, as well as a selection of more
specific base classes.

.. WARNING::

    Those classes, except maybe for the lowest ones like :class:`Ring`,
    :class:`CommutativeRing`, :class:`Algebra` and :class:`CommutativeAlgebra`,
    are being progressively deprecated in favor of the corresponding
    categories. which are more flexible, in particular with respect to multiple
    inheritance.

The class inheritance hierarchy is:

- :class:`Ring`

  - :class:`Algebra`
  - :class:`CommutativeRing`

    - :class:`NoetherianRing`
    - :class:`CommutativeAlgebra`
    - :class:`IntegralDomain`

      - :class:`DedekindDomain`
      - :class:`PrincipalIdealDomain`

Subclasses of :class:`PrincipalIdealDomain` are

- :class:`EuclideanDomain`
- :class:`Field`

  - :class:`~sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_base.FiniteField`

Some aspects of this structure may seem strange, but this is an unfortunate
consequence of the fact that Cython classes do not support multiple
inheritance. Hence, for instance, :class:`Field` cannot be a subclass of both
:class:`NoetherianRing` and :class:`PrincipalIdealDomain`, although all fields
are Noetherian PIDs.

(A distinct but equally awkward issue is that sometimes we may not know *in
advance* whether or not a ring belongs in one of these classes; e.g. some
orders in number fields are Dedekind domains, but others are not, and we still
want to offer a unified interface, so orders are never instances of the
:class:`DedekindDomain` class.)

AUTHORS:

- David Harvey (2006-10-16): changed :class:`CommutativeAlgebra` to derive from
  :class:`CommutativeRing` instead of from :class:`Algebra`.
- David Loeffler (2009-07-09): documentation fixes, added to reference manual.
- Simon King (2011-03-29): Proper use of the category framework for rings.
- Simon King (2011-05-20): Modify multiplication and _ideal_class_ to support
  ideals of non-commutative rings.

        In a field, any nonzero element is a GCD of any nonempty set
        of nonzero elements. In previous versions, Sage used to return
        1 in the case of the rational field. However, since :trac:`10771`,
        the rational field is considered as the
        *fraction field* of the integer ring. For the fraction field
        of an integral domain that provides both GCD and LCM, it is
        possible to pick a GCD that is compatible with the GCD of the
        base ring::

            sage: QQ.gcd(ZZ(42), ZZ(48)); type(QQ.gcd(ZZ(42), ZZ(48)))

        Polynomial rings over fields are GCD domains as well. Here is a simple
        example over the ring of polynomials over the rationals as well as
