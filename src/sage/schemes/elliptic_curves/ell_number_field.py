Elliptic curves over number fields

An elliptic curve `E` over a number field `K` can be given
by a Weierstrass equation whose coefficients lie in `K` or by
using ``base_extend`` on an elliptic curve defined over a subfield.

One major difference to elliptic curves over `\QQ` is that there
might not exist a global minimal equation over `K`, when `K` does
not have class number one.
Another difference is the lack of understanding of modularity for
general elliptic curves over general number fields.

Currently Sage can obtain local information about `E/K_v` for finite places
`v`, it has an interface to Denis Simon's script for 2-descent, it can compute
the torsion subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group `E(K)`, and it can work with
isogenies defined over `K`.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
    sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,4+i])
    sage: E.discriminant()
    -3456*i - 6480
    sage: P= E([i,2])
    sage: P+P
    (-2*i + 9/16 : -9/4*i - 101/64 : 1)

    sage: E.has_good_reduction(2+i)
    True
    sage: E.local_data(4+i)

    Reduction type: bad additive
    Local minimal model: Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (i+4) over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
    Minimal discriminant valuation: 2
    Conductor exponent: 2
    Kodaira Symbol: II
    Tamagawa Number: 1

        This method is used internally by the :meth:`~rank`,
        :meth:`~rank_bounds` and :meth:`~gens` methods.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` -- an elliptic curve `E` over a number field `K`

        - ``verbose`` -- 0, 1, 2, or 3 (default: 0), the verbosity level

        - ``lim1`` -- (default: 2) limit on trivial points on quartics

        - ``lim3`` -- (default: 4) limit on points on ELS quartics

        - ``limtriv`` -- (default: 2) limit on trivial points on `E`

        - ``maxprob`` -- (default: 20)

        - ``limbigprime`` -- (default: 30) to distinguish between
          small and large prime numbers. Use probabilistic tests for
          large primes. If 0, do not use probabilistic tests.

        - ``known_points`` -- (default: None) list of known points on
          the curve

        OUTPUT: a triple ``(lower, upper, list)`` consisting of

        - ``lower`` (integer) -- lower bound on the rank

        - ``upper`` (integer) -- upper bound on the rank

        - ``list`` -- list of points in `E(K)`

        The integer ``upper`` is in fact an upper bound on the
        dimension of the 2-Selmer group, hence on the dimension of
        `E(K)/2E(K)`.  It is equal to the dimension of the 2-Selmer
        group except possibly if `E(K)[2]` has dimension 1.  In that
        case, ``upper`` may exceed the dimension of the 2-Selmer group
        by an even number, due to the fact that the algorithm does not
        perform a second descent.

           For non-quadratic number fields, this code does return, but
           it takes a long time.

        r"""
        Given an elliptic curve over a number field `F` and a prime number `p`,
        construct the field `F(E[p])`.

        INPUT:

        - ``p`` -- a prime number (an element of `\ZZ`)

        - ``names`` -- a variable name for the number field

        - ``map`` -- (default: ``False``) also return an embedding of
          the :meth:`base_field` into the resulting field.

        - ``kwds`` -- additional keywords passed to

        OUTPUT:

        If ``map`` is ``False``, the division field as an absolute number
        field.  If ``map`` is ``True``, a tuple ``(K, phi)`` where ``phi``
        is an embedding of the base field in the division field ``K``.

        .. WARNING::

            This takes a very long time when the degree of the division
            field is large (e.g. when `p` is large or when the Galois
            representation is surjective).  The ``simplify`` flag also
            has a big influence on the running time: sometimes
            ``simplify=False`` is faster, sometimes ``simplify=True``
            (the default) is faster.

        EXAMPLES:

        The 2-division field is the same as the splitting field of
        the 2-division polynomial (therefore, it has degree 1, 2, 3 or 6)::

            sage: E = EllipticCurve('15a1')
            sage: K.<b> = E.division_field(2); K
            Number Field in b with defining polynomial x
            sage: E = EllipticCurve('14a1')
            sage: K.<b> = E.division_field(2); K
            Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 + 5*x + 92

        For odd primes `p`, the division field is either the splitting
        field of the `p`-division polynomial, or a quadratic extension
        of it. ::

            sage: E = EllipticCurve('50a1')
            sage: F.<a> = E.division_polynomial(3).splitting_field(simplify_all=True); F
            Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^6 - 3*x^5 + 4*x^4 - 3*x^3 - 2*x^2 + 3*x + 3
            sage: K.<b> = E.division_field(3, simplify_all=True); K
            Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^6 - 3*x^5 + 4*x^4 - 3*x^3 - 2*x^2 + 3*x + 3

        If we take any quadratic twist, the splitting field of the
        3-division polynomial remains the same, but the 3-division field
        becomes a quadratic extension::

            sage: E = E.quadratic_twist(5)  # 50b3
            sage: F.<a> = E.division_polynomial(3).splitting_field(simplify_all=True); F
            Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^6 - 3*x^5 + 4*x^4 - 3*x^3 - 2*x^2 + 3*x + 3
            sage: K.<b> = E.division_field(3, simplify_all=True); K
            Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^12 - 3*x^11 + 8*x^10 - 15*x^9 + 30*x^8 - 63*x^7 + 109*x^6 - 144*x^5 + 150*x^4 - 120*x^3 + 68*x^2 - 24*x + 4

        Try another quadratic twist, this time over a subfield of `F`::

            sage: G.<c>,_,_ = F.subfields(3)[0]
            sage: E = E.base_extend(G).quadratic_twist(c); E
            Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 5*a0*x^2 + (-200*a0^2)*x + (-42000*a0^2+42000*a0+126000) over Number Field in a0 with defining polynomial x^3 - 3*x^2 + 3*x + 9
            sage: K.<b> = E.division_field(3, simplify_all=True); K
            Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^12 - 10*x^10 + 55*x^8 - 60*x^6 + 75*x^4 + 1350*x^2 + 2025

        Some higher-degree examples::

            sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
            sage: K.<b> = E.division_field(2); K
            Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^6 + 2*x^5 - 48*x^4 - 436*x^3 + 1668*x^2 + 28792*x + 73844

        # THEOREM (Cremona, http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11905#comment:21).
        # Let K be a field, E an elliptic curve over K and p an odd
        # prime number. Assume that K contains all roots of the
        # p-division polynomial of E. Then either K contains all
        # p-torsion points on E, or it does not contain any p-torsion
        # point.
        #
        # PROOF. Let G be the absolute Galois group of K (every element
        # in it fixes all elements of K). For any p-torsion point P
        # over the algebraic closure and any sigma in G, we must have
        # either sigma(P) = P or sigma(P) = -P (since K contains the
        # X-coordinate of P). Now assume that K does not contain all
        # p-torsion points. Then there exists a point P1 and a sigma in
        # G such that sigma(P1) = -P1. Now take a different p-torsion
        # point P2. Since sigma(P2) must be P2 or -P2 and
        # sigma(P1+P2) = sigma(P1)+sigma(P2) = sigma(P1)-P2 must
        # be P1+P2 or -(P1+P2), it follows that sigma(P2) = -sigma(P2).
        # Therefore, K cannot contain any p-torsion point.
        #
        # This implies that it suffices to adjoin the Y-coordinate
        # of just one point.

        r"""
        Local data for this elliptic curve at the prime `P`.

        INPUT:

        - ``P`` -- either None, a prime ideal of the base field of self, or an element of the base field that generates a prime ideal.

        - ``proof`` -- whether to only use provably correct methods
          (default controlled by global proof module).  Note that the
          proof module is number_field, not elliptic_curves, since the
          functions that actually need the flag are in number fields.

        - ``algorithm`` (string, default: "pari") -- Ignored unless the
          base field is `\QQ`.  If "pari", use the PARI C-library
          :pari:`ellglobalred` implementation of Tate's algorithm over
          `\QQ`. If "generic", use the general number field
          implementation.

        - ``globally`` -- whether the local algorithm uses global generators
          for the prime ideals. Default is False, which will not require any
          information about the class group. If True, a generator for `P`
          will be used if `P` is principal. Otherwise, or if ``globally``
          is False, the minimal model returned will preserve integrality
          at other primes, but not minimality.

        OUTPUT:

        If `P` is specified, returns the ``EllipticCurveLocalData``
        object associated to the prime `P` for this curve.  Otherwise,
        returns a list of such objects, one for each prime `P` in the
        support of the discriminant of this model.

        .. note::

           The model is not required to be integral on input.

        by local_data() which is the user interface and which parses
        the input parameters `P` and proof.

        INPUT:

        - ``P`` -- either None or a prime ideal of the base field of self.

        - ``proof`` -- whether to only use provably correct methods
          (default controlled by global proof module).  Note that the
          proof module is number_field, not elliptic_curves, since the
          functions that actually need the flag are in number fields.

        - ``algorithm`` (string, default: "pari") -- Ignored unless the
          base field is `\QQ`.  If "pari", use the PARI C-library
          :pari:`ellglobalred` implementation of Tate's algorithm over
          `\QQ`. If "generic", use the general number field
          implementation.

        - ``globally`` -- whether the local algorithm uses global generators
          for the prime ideals. Default is False, which will not require any
          information about the class group. If True, a generator for `P`
          will be used if `P` is principal. Otherwise, or if ``globally``
          is False, the minimal model returned will preserve integrality
          at other primes, but not minimality.

           For non-quadratic number fields, this code does
           return, but it takes a long time.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 23, 'a')
            sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, '37')
            sage: E == loads(dumps(E))
            True
            sage: E.rank_bounds()
            (2, 2)

        Here is a curve with two-torsion, again the bounds coincide::

            sage: Qrt5.<rt5> = NumberField(x^2-5)
            sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,5-rt5,0,rt5,0])
            sage: E.rank_bounds()
            (1, 1)

        Finally an example with non-trivial 2-torsion in Sha. So the
        2-descent will not be able to determine the rank, but can only
        give bounds::

            sage: E = EllipticCurve("15a5")
            sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^2-6)
            sage: EK = E.base_extend(K)
            sage: EK.rank_bounds(lim1=1,lim3=1,limtriv=1)
            (0, 2)

        .. note::

           The precision of the embedding is ignored: we only use the

        EXAMPLES:

        First define a field with two real embeddings::

            sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,a,2])

        - ``minimal_models`` (bool, default ``True``) -- if ``True``,
          all curves in the class will be minimal or semi-minimal
          models.  Over fields of larger degree it can be expensive to
          compute these so set to ``False``.

        OUTPUT:

        An instance of the class

        From this object may be obtained a list of curves in the
        class, a matrix of the degrees of the isogenies between them,
        and the isogenies themselves.

        .. note::

            If using the algorithm 'heuristic' for non-CM curves, the
            result is not guaranteed to be the complete isogeny class,
            since only reducible primes up to the default bound in
            :meth:`reducible_primes_naive` (currently 1000) are
            tested.  However, no examples of non-CM elliptic curves
            with reducible primes greater than 100 have yet been
            computed so the output is likely to be correct.

        .. note::

            By default, the curves in the isogeny class will all be
            minimal models if these exist (for example, when the class
            number is `1`); otherwise they will be minimal at all but
            one prime.  This behaviour can be switched off if desired,
            for example over fields where the computation of the class
            group would be too expensive.

        An example with CM by `\sqrt{-23}` (class number `3`)::

            sage: pol = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')([1,-3,5,-5,5,-3,1])
            sage: L.<a> = NumberField(pol)
            sage: js = hilbert_class_polynomial(-23).roots(L,multiplicities=False); len(js)

            3
            sage: C = E.isogeny_class(); len(C)  # long time
            6

        The reason for the isogeny class having size six while the
        class number is only `3` is that the class also contains three
        curves with CM by the order of discriminant `-92=4\cdot(-23)`,
        which also has class number `3`.  The curves in the class are
        sorted first by CM discriminant (then lexicographically using
        a-invariants)::

            sage: [F.cm_discriminant() for F in C]  # long time
            [-23, -23, -23, -92, -92, -92]

        `2` splits in the order with discriminant `-23`, into two
        primes of order `3` in the class group, each of which induces
        a `2`-isogeny to a curve with the same endomorphism ring; the
        third `2`-isogeny is to a curve with the smaller endomorphism
        ring::

            sage: [phi.codomain().cm_discriminant() for phi in E.isogenies_prime_degree()]  # long time
            [-92, -23, -23]

            sage: C.matrix()  # long time
            [1 2 2 4 2 4]
            [2 1 2 2 4 4]
            [2 2 1 4 4 2]
            [4 2 4 1 3 3]
            [2 4 4 3 1 3]
            [4 4 2 3 3 1]

        The graph of this isogeny class has a shape which does not
        occur over `\QQ`: a triangular prism.  Note that for curves
        without CM, the graph has an edge between two curves if and
        only if they are connected by an isogeny of prime degree, and
        this degree is uniquely determined by the two curves, but in
        the CM case this property does not hold, since for pairs of
        curves in the class with the same endomorphism ring `O`, the
        set of degrees of isogenies between them is the set of
        integers represented by a primitive integral binary quadratic
        form of discriminant `\text{disc}(O)`, and this form
        represents infinitely many primes.  In the matrix we give a
        small prime represented by the appropriate form.  In this
        example, the matrix is formed by four `3\times3` blocks.  The
        isogenies of degree `2` indicated by the upper left `3\times3`
        block of the matrix could be replaced by isogenies of any
        degree represented by the quadratic form `2x^2+xy+3y^2` of
        discriminant `-23`.  Similarly in the lower right block, the
        entries of `3` could be represented by any integers
        represented by the quadratic form `3x^2+2xy+8y^2` of
        discriminant `-92`.  In the top right block and lower left
        blocks, by contrast, the prime entries `2` are unique
        determined::

            sage: G = C.graph()  # long time
            sage: G.adjacency_matrix()  # long time
            [0 1 1 0 1 0]

            [0 1 0 0 1 1]
            [1 0 0 1 0 1]
            [0 0 1 1 1 0]

        To display the graph without any edge labels::

            sage: G.show()  # not tested

        To display the graph with edge labels: by default, for curves
        with rational CM, the labels are the coefficients of the
        associated quadratic forms::

            sage: G.show(edge_labels=True)  # not tested

        For an alternative view, first relabel the edges using only 2
        labels to distinguish between isogenies between curves with
        the same endomorphism ring and isogenies between curves with
        different endomorphism rings, then use a 3-dimensional plot
        which can be rotated::

            sage: for i,j,l in G.edge_iterator():  # long time
            ....:     G.set_edge_label(i, j, l.count(','))
            sage: G.show3d(color_by_label=True)  # long time

        A class number `6` example.  First we set up the fields: ``pol``
        defines the same field as ``pol26`` but is simpler::

            sage: pol26 = hilbert_class_polynomial(-4*26)
            sage: pol = x^6-x^5+2*x^4+x^3-2*x^2-x-1
            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(pol)
            sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^2+26)

        Only `2` of the `j`-invariants with discriminant -104 are in
        `K`, though all are in `L`::

           sage: len(pol26.roots(K))
           2
           sage: len(pol26.roots(L))
           6

        We create an elliptic curve defined over `K` with one of the
        `j`-invariants in `K`::

            sage: j1 = pol26.roots(K)[0][0]
            sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=j1)
            sage: E.has_cm()
            True
            sage: E.has_rational_cm()
            False
            sage: E.has_rational_cm(L)
            True

        Over `K` the isogeny class has size `4`, with `2` curves for
        each of the `2` `K`-rational `j`-invariants::

            sage: C = E.isogeny_class(); len(C) # long time (~11s)
            4
            sage: C.matrix()                    # long time
            [ 1 13  2 26]
            [13  1 26  2]
            [ 2 26  1 13]
            [26  2 13  1]
            sage: len(Set([EE.j_invariant() for EE in C.curves]))  # long time
            2

        Over `L`, the isogeny class grows to size `6` (the class
        number)::

            sage: EL = E.change_ring(L)
            sage: CL = EL.isogeny_class(minimal_models=False) # long time
            sage: len(CL) # long time
            6
            sage: s1 = Set([EE.j_invariant() for EE in CL.curves]) # long time
            sage: s2 = Set(pol26.roots(L,multiplicities=False)) # long time
            sage: s1 == s2 # long time
            True

        In each position in the matrix of degrees, we see primes (or
        `1`).  In fact the set of degrees of cyclic isogenies from
        curve `i` to curve `j` is infinite, and is the set of all
        integers represented by one of the primitive binary quadratic
        forms of discriminant `-104`, from which we have selected a
        small prime::

            sage: CL.matrix() # long time # random (see :trac:`19229`)
            [1 2 3 3 5 5]
            [2 1 5 5 3 3]
            [3 5 1 3 2 5]
            [3 5 3 1 5 2]
            [5 3 2 5 1 3]
            [5 3 5 2 3 1]

        To see the array of binary quadratic forms::

            sage: CL.qf_matrix()  # long time # random (see :trac:`19229`)
            [[[1], [2, 0, 13], [3, -2, 9], [3, -2, 9], [5, -4, 6], [5, -4, 6]],
             [[2, 0, 13], [1], [5, -4, 6], [5, -4, 6], [3, -2, 9], [3, -2, 9]],
             [[3, -2, 9], [5, -4, 6], [1], [3, -2, 9], [2, 0, 13], [5, -4, 6]],
             [[3, -2, 9], [5, -4, 6], [3, -2, 9], [1], [5, -4, 6], [2, 0, 13]],
             [[5, -4, 6], [3, -2, 9], [2, 0, 13], [5, -4, 6], [1], [3, -2, 9]],
             [[5, -4, 6], [3, -2, 9], [5, -4, 6], [2, 0, 13], [3, -2, 9], [1]]]

        As in the non-CM case, the isogeny class may be visualized by
        obtaining its graph and plotting it.  Since there are more
        edges than in the non-CM case, it may be preferable to omit
        the edge_labels::

            sage: G = C.graph()
            sage: G.show(edge_labels=False) # long time

        It is possible to display a 3-dimensional plot, with colours
        to represent the different edge labels, in a form which can be
        rotated!::

            sage: G.show3d(color_by_label=True) # long time

        Over larger number fields several options make computations
        tractable.  Here we use algorithm 'heuristic' which avoids a
        rigorous computation of the reducible primes, only testing
        those less than 1000, and setting ``minimal_models`` to
        ``False`` avoid having to compute the class group of `K`.  To
        obtain minimal models set proof.number_field(False); the class
        group computation takes an additional 10s::

            sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(53)
            sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[0,6,0,2,0])
            sage: C = E.isogeny_class(algorithm='heuristic', minimal_models=False); C # long time (10s)

        The compatible family of the Galois representation
        attached to this elliptic curve.

        Given an elliptic curve `E` over a number field `K`
        and a rational prime number `p`, the `p^n`-torsion
        `E[p^n]` points of `E` is a representation of the
        absolute Galois group of `K`. As `n` varies
        we obtain the Tate module `T_p E` which is a
        a representation of `G_K` on a free `\ZZ_p`-module
        of rank `2`. As `p` varies the representations
        are compatible.

        Given a list of rational points on `E` over `K`, compute the
        saturation in `E(K)` of the subgroup they generate.

        INPUT:

        - ``points (list)`` - list of points on E.  Points of finite
          order are ignored; the remaining points should be independent,
          or an error is raised.

        - ``verbose`` (bool) - (default: ``False``), if ``True``, give
          verbose output.

        - ``max_prime`` (int, default 0), saturation is performed
          for all primes up to ``max_prime``. If ``max_prime`` is 0,
          perform saturation at *all* primes, i.e., compute the true
          saturation.

        - ``odd_primes_only`` (bool, default ``False``) -- only do
          saturation at odd primes.

        - ``one_prime`` (int, default 0) -- if nonzero, only do
          saturation at this prime.

        The following two inputs are optional, and may be provided to speed
        up the computation.

        - ``lower_ht_bound`` (real, default ``None``) -- lower bound of
          the regulator `E(K)`, if known.

        - ``reg`` (real, default ``None``), regulator of the span of
          points, if known.

        - ``debug`` (int, default 0) -- , used for debugging and
          testing.

        OUTPUT:

        - ``saturation`` (list) - points that form a basis for the
          saturation.

        - ``index`` (int) - the index of the group generated by the
          input points in their saturation.

        - ``regulator`` (real with default precision, or ``None``) -
          regulator of saturated points.

        ALGORITHM:

        For rank 1 subgroups, simply do trial division up to the maximal
        prime divisor. For higher rank subgroups, perform trial division
        on all linear combinations for small primes, and look for
        projections `E(K) \rightarrow \oplus E(k) \otimes \mathbf{F}_p` which
        are either full rank or provide `p`-divisible linear combinations,
        where the `k` here are residue fields of `K`.

        Find rational points on the elliptic curve, all arguments are passed

            sage: E.rational_points(bound=8) # long time
