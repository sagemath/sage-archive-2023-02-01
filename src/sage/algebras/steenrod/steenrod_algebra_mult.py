.. rubric:: Milnor multiplication, `p=2`

See Milnor's paper [Mil1958]_ for proofs, etc.

To multiply Milnor basis elements $\text{Sq}(r_1, r_2, ...)$ and
$\text{Sq}(s_1, s_2,...)$ at the prime 2, form all possible matrices
$M$ with rows and columns indexed starting at 0, with position (0,0)
deleted (or ignored), with $s_i$ equal to the sum of column $i$ for
each $i$, and with $r_j$ equal to the 'weighted' sum of row $j$.  The
weights are as follows: elements from column $i$ are multiplied by
$2^i$.  For example, to multiply $\text{Sq}(2)$ and $\text{Sq}(1,1)$,
form the matrices

.. MATH::

  \begin{Vmatrix}
  * & 1 & 1 \\
  2 & 0 & 0
  \end{Vmatrix}
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  \begin{Vmatrix}
  * & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0
  \end{Vmatrix}

(The $*$ is the ignored (0,0)-entry of the matrix.)  For each such
matrix $M$, compute a multinomial coefficient, mod 2: for each
diagonal $\{m_{ij}: i+j=n\}$, compute $(\sum m_{i,j}!) / (m_{0,n}!
m_{1,n-1}!  ... m_{n,0}!)$.  Multiply these together for all $n$.  (To
compute this mod 2, view the entries of the matrix as their base 2
expansions; then this coefficient is zero if and only if there is some
diagonal containing two numbers which have a summand in common in
their base 2 expansion.  For example, if 3 and 10 are in the same
diagonal, the coefficient is zero, because $3=1+2$ and $10=2+8$: they
both have a summand of 2.)

Now, for each matrix with multinomial coefficient 1, let $t_n$ be
the sum of the nth diagonal in the matrix; then

.. MATH::

  \text{Sq}(r_1, r_2, ...) \text{Sq}(s_1, s_2, ...) = \sum \text{Sq}(t_1, t_2, ...)

The function :func:`milnor_multiplication` takes as input two tuples
of non-negative integers, $r$ and $s$, which represent
$\text{Sq}(r)=\text{Sq}(r_1, r_2, ...)$ and
$\text{Sq}(s)=\text{Sq}(s_1, s_2, ...)$; it returns as output a
dictionary whose keys are tuples $t=(t_1, t_2, ...)$ of non-negative
integers, and for each tuple the associated value is the coefficient
of $\text{Sq}(t)$ in the product formula.  (Since we are working mod 2,
this coefficient is 1 -- if it is zero, the element is omitted from
the dictionary altogether).

.. rubric:: Milnor multiplication, odd primes

As for the `p=2` case, see Milnor's paper [Mil1958]_ for proofs.

Fix an odd prime $p$.  There are three steps to multiply Milnor basis
elements $Q_{f_1} Q_{f_2} ... \mathcal{P}(q_1, q_2, ...)$ and
$Q_{g_1} Q_{g_2} ... \mathcal{P}(s_1, s_2,...)$: first, use the formula

.. MATH::

    \mathcal{P}(q_1, q_2, ...) Q_k = Q_k \mathcal{P}(q_1, q_2, ...)
    + Q_{k+1} \mathcal{P}(q_1 - p^k, q_2, ...)
    + Q_{k+2} \mathcal{P}(q_1, q_2 - p^k, ...)
    + ...

Second, use the fact that the $Q_k$'s form an exterior algebra: $Q_k^2 =
0$ for all $k$, and if $i \neq j$, then $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ anticommute:
$Q_i Q_j = -Q_j Q_i$.  After these two steps, the product is a linear
combination of terms of the form

.. MATH::

    Q_{e_1} Q_{e_2} ... \mathcal{P}(r_1, r_2, ...) \mathcal{P}(s_1, s_2, ...).

Finally, use Milnor matrices to multiply the pairs of
$\mathcal{P}(...)$ terms, as at the prime 2: form all possible
matrices $M$ with rows and columns indexed starting at 0, with
position (0,0) deleted (or ignored), with $s_i$ equal to the sum of
column $i$ for each $i$, and with $r_j$ equal to the weighted sum of
row $j$: elements from column $i$ are multiplied by $p^i$.  For
example when $p=5$, to multiply $\mathcal{P}(5)$ and
$\mathcal{P}(1,1)$, form the matrices

.. MATH::

    \begin{Vmatrix}
    * & 1 & 1 \\
    5 & 0 & 0
    \end{Vmatrix}
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    \begin{Vmatrix}
    * & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 0
    \end{Vmatrix}

For each such matrix $M$, compute a multinomial coefficient, mod $p$:
for each diagonal $\{m_{ij}: i+j=n\}$, compute $(\sum m_{i,j}!) /
(m_{0,n}!  m_{1,n-1}!  ... m_{n,0}!)$.  Multiply these together for
all $n$.

Now, for each matrix with nonzero multinomial coefficient $b_M$, let
$t_n$ be the sum of the $n$-th diagonal in the matrix; then

.. MATH::

    \mathcal{P}(r_1, r_2, ...) \mathcal{P}(s_1, s_2, ...)
    = \sum b_M \mathcal{P}(t_1, t_2, ...)

For example when $p=5$, we have

.. MATH::

    \mathcal{P}(5) \mathcal{P}(1,1) = \mathcal{P}(6,1) + 2 \mathcal{P}(0,2).

The function :func:`milnor_multiplication` takes as input two pairs of
tuples of non-negative integers, $(g,q)$ and $(f,s)$, which represent
$Q_{g_1} Q_{g_2} ... \mathcal{P}(q_1, q_2, ...)$ and
$Q_{f_1} Q_{f_2} ... \mathcal{P}(s_1, s_2, ...)$.  It returns as output a
dictionary whose keys are pairs of tuples $(e,t)$ of non-negative
integers, and for each tuple the associated value is the coefficient
in the product formula.

.. rubric:: The Adem relations and admissible sequences

If `p=2`, then the mod 2 Steenrod algebra is generated by Steenrod
squares `\text{Sq}^a` for `a \geq 0` (equal to the Milnor basis element
`\text{Sq}(a)`).  The *Adem relations* are as follows: if `a < 2b`,

.. MATH::

    \text{Sq}^a \text{Sq}^b = \sum_{j=0}^{a/2} \binom{b-j-1}{a-2j} \text{Sq}^{a+b-j} \text{Sq}^j

A monomial `\text{Sq}^{i_1} \text{Sq}^{i_2} ... \text{Sq}^{i_n}` is called *admissible* if
`i_k \geq 2 i_{k+1}` for all `k`.  One can use the Adem relations to
show that the admissible monomials span the Steenrod algebra, as a
vector space; with more work, one can show that the admissible
monomials are also linearly independent.  They form the *Serre-Cartan*
basis for the Steenrod algebra.  To multiply a collection of
admissible monomials, concatenate them and see if the result is
admissible.  If it is, you're done.  If not, find the first pair `\text{Sq}^a
\text{Sq}^b` where it fails to be admissible and apply the Adem relations
there.  Repeat with the resulting terms.  One can prove that this
process terminates in a finite number of steps, and therefore gives a
procedure for multiplying elements of the Serre-Cartan basis.

At an odd prime `p`, the Steenrod algebra is generated by the pth
power operations `\mathcal{P}^a` (the same as `\mathcal{P}(a)` in the
Milnor basis) and the Bockstein operation `\beta` (= `Q_0` in the
Milnor basis).  The odd primary *Adem relations* are as follows: if `a
< pb`,

.. MATH::

    \mathcal{P}^a \mathcal{P}^b = \sum_{j=0}^{a/p} (-1)^{a+j}
    \binom{(b-j)(p-1)-1}{a-pj} \mathcal{P}^{a+b-j} \mathcal{P}^j

Also, if `a \leq pb`,

.. MATH::

    \mathcal{P}^a \beta \mathcal{P}^b = \sum_{j=0}^{a/p} (-1)^{a+j}
    \binom{(b-j)(p-1)}{a-pj} \beta \mathcal{P}^{a+b-j} \mathcal{P}^j +
    \sum_{j=0}^{a/p} (-1)^{a+j-1} \binom{(b-j)(p-1)-1}{a-pj-1}
    \mathcal{P}^{a+b-j} \beta \mathcal{P}^j

The *admissible* monomials at an odd prime are products of the form

.. MATH::

    \beta^{\epsilon_0} \mathcal{P}^{s_1} \beta^{\epsilon_1}
    \mathcal{P}^{s_2} ...  \mathcal{P}^{s_n} \beta^{\epsilon_n}

where `s_k \geq \epsilon_{k+1} + p s_{k+1}` for all `k`.  As at the
prime 2, these form a basis for the Steenrod algebra.

The main function for this is :func:`make_mono_admissible`,
which converts a product of Steenrod
squares or pth power operations and Bocksteins into a dictionary
representing a sum of admissible monomials.

def milnor_multiplication(r,s):

    Product of Milnor basis elements r and s at the prime 2.

    - r -- tuple of non-negative integers
    - s -- tuple of non-negative integers

    OUTPUT:

    Dictionary of terms of the form (tuple: coeff), where
    'tuple' is a tuple of non-negative integers and 'coeff' is 1.

    This computes Milnor matrices for the product of $\text{Sq}(r)$
    and $\text{Sq}(s)$, computes their multinomial coefficients, and
    for each matrix whose coefficient is 1, add $\text{Sq}(t)$ to the
    output, where $t$ is the tuple formed by the diagonals sums from
    the matrix.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: sorted(milnor_multiplication((2,4), (0,1)).items())
        [((2, 0, 0, 1), 1), ((2, 5), 1)]

    These examples correspond to the following product computations:

    .. MATH::

        \text{Sq}(2) \text{Sq}(1) = \text{Sq}(0,1) + \text{Sq}(3)

        \text{Sq}(4) \text{Sq}(2,1) = \text{Sq}(6,1) + \text{Sq}(0,3) + \text{Sq}(2,0,1)

        \text{Sq}(2,4) \text{Sq}(0,1) = \text{Sq}(2, 5) + \text{Sq}(2, 0, 0, 1)

    Given the input $[n_1, n_2, n_3, ...]$, this computes the
    multinomial coefficient $(n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + ...)! / (n_1! n_2!

    $n_i$ in binary.  If there is a 1 in the same digit for any $n_i$

    Multinomial coefficient of list, mod p.

    INPUT:

    - p -- a prime number

    OUTPUT:

    Associated multinomial coefficient, mod p

    Given the input $[n_1, n_2, n_3, ...]$, this computes the
    multinomial coefficient $(n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + ...)! / (n_1! n_2!
    n_3! ...)$, mod $p$.  The method is this: expand each $n_i$ in
    base $p$: $n_i = \sum_j p^j n_{ij}$.  Do the same for the sum of
    the $n_i$'s, which we call $m$: $m = \sum_j p^j m_j$.  Then the
    multinomial coefficient is congruent, mod $p$, to the product of
    the multinomial coefficients $m_j! / (n_{1j}! n_{2j}! ...)$.

    Furthermore, any multinomial coefficient $m! / (n_1! n_2! ...)$
    can be computed as a product of binomial coefficients: it equals

    .. MATH::

       \binom{n_1}{n_1} \binom{n_1 + n_2}{n_2} \binom{n_1 + n_2 + n_3}{n_3} ...

    This is convenient because Sage's binomial function returns
    integers, not rational numbers (as would be produced just by
    dividing factorials).

    OUTPUT:

    a dictionary representing the mod `p` Adem relations
    applied to `P^a P^b` or (if `c` present) to `P^a \beta^b P^c`.

    The mod `p` Adem relations for the mod `p` Steenrod algebra are as
    follows: if `p=2`, then if `a < 2b`,

    .. MATH::

       \text{Sq}^a \text{Sq}^b = \sum_{j=0}^{a/2} \binom{b-j-1}{a-2j} \text{Sq}^{a+b-j} \text{Sq}^j

    If two arguments (`a` and `b`) are given, then computations are
    done mod 2.  If `a \geq 2b`, then the dictionary {(a,b): 1} is

    for `\text{Sq}^a \text{Sq}^b` is returned.  For example, since

    If `p` is given and is odd, then with two inputs `a` and `b`, the

    Given a tuple ``mono``, view it as a product of Steenrod
    operations, and return a dictionary giving data equivalent to
    writing that product as a linear combination of admissible
    monomials.

    When `p=2`, the sequence (and hence the corresponding monomial)
    `(i_1, i_2, ...)` is admissible if `i_j \geq 2 i_{j+1}` for all
    `j`.

    When `p` is odd, the sequence `(e_1, i_1, e_2, i_2, ...)` is
    admissible if `i_j \geq e_{j+1} + p i_{j+1}` for all `j`.

    INPUT:

    - ``mono`` - a tuple of non-negative integers
    - `p` - prime number, optional (default 2)
    - `generic` - whether to use the generic Steenrod algebra, (default: depends on prime)

    OUTPUT:

    Dictionary of terms of the form (tuple: coeff), where
    'tuple' is an admissible tuple of non-negative integers and
    'coeff' is its coefficient.  This corresponds to a linear
    combination of admissible monomials.  When `p` is odd, each tuple
    must have an odd length: it should be of the form `(e_1, i_1, e_2,
    i_2, ..., e_k)` where each `e_j` is either 0 or 1 and each `i_j`
    is a positive integer: this corresponds to the admissible monomial

    ALGORITHM:

    Given `(i_1, i_2, i_3, ...)`, apply the Adem relations to the first
    pair (or triple when `p` is odd) where the sequence is inadmissible,
    and then apply this function recursively to each of the resulting
