        Change the graph implementation

        INPUT:

        - ``weighted`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); weightedness for the
          copy. Might change the equality class if not ``None``.

        - ``sparse`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); ``sparse=True`` is an alias
          for ``data_structure="sparse"``, and ``sparse=False`` is an alias for
          ``data_structure="dense"``. Only used when ``data_structure=None``.

        - ``data_structure`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of ``"sparse"``,
          ``"static_sparse"``, or ``"dense"``. See the documentation of
          :class:`Graph` or :class:`DiGraph`.

        - ``immutable`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to create a
          mutable/immutable copy. Only used when ``data_structure=None``.

          * ``immutable=None`` (default) means that the graph and its copy will
            behave the same way.

          * ``immutable=True`` is a shortcut for
            ``data_structure='static_sparse'``

          * ``immutable=False`` means that the created graph is mutable. When
            used to copy an immutable graph, the data structure used is
            ``"sparse"`` unless anything else is specified.

        .. NOTE::

            If the graph uses
            :class:`~sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend.StaticSparseBackend`
            and the ``_immutable`` flag, then ``self`` is returned rather than a
            copy (unless one of the optional arguments is used).

        OUTPUT:

        A Graph object.

        .. WARNING::

           Please use this method only if you need to copy but change the
           underlying data structure or weightedness. Otherwise simply do
           ``copy(g)`` instead of ``g.copy()``.

        .. WARNING::

           If ``weighted`` is passed and is not the weightedness of the
           original, then the copy will not equal the original.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: g = Graph({0: [0, 1, 1, 2]}, loops=True, multiedges=True, sparse=True)
            sage: g == copy(g)

            sage: g = DiGraph({0: [0, 1, 1, 2], 1: [0, 1]}, loops=True, multiedges=True, sparse=True)
            sage: g == copy(g)
            True

        Note that vertex associations are also kept::

            sage: d = {0: graphs.DodecahedralGraph(), 1: graphs.FlowerSnark(), 2: graphs.MoebiusKantorGraph(), 3: graphs.PetersenGraph()}
            sage: T = graphs.TetrahedralGraph()

            sage: T2.get_vertex(0)
            Dodecahedron: Graph on 20 vertices

        Notice that the copy is at least as deep as the objects::

            sage: T2.get_vertex(0) is T.get_vertex(0)
            False

        Examples of the keywords in use::

            sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(9)
            sage: H = G.copy()
            sage: H == G; H is G

            sage: G2 = copy(G)
            sage: G2 is G
            False

        Argument ``weighted`` affects the equality class::

            sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
            sage: H1 = G.copy(weighted=False)
            sage: H2 = G.copy(weighted=True)

            [True, False, False]
            sage: G.weighted(True)
            sage: [G == H1, G == H2, H1 == H2]
            [False, True, False]

        TESTS:

        We make copies of the ``_pos`` attribute::

            sage: h._pos is g._pos
            False

        We make sure that one can make immutable copies by providing the
        ``data_structure`` optional argument, and that copying an immutable
        graph returns the graph::

            sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: hash(G)
            Traceback (most recent call last):

            immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`
            sage: g = G.copy(immutable=True)
            sage: hash(g)    # random
            1833517720
            sage: g==G
            True
            sage: (g is g.copy()) and (g is not copy(g))
            True

        ``immutable=True`` is a short-cut for
        ``data_structure='static_sparse'``::

            sage: g is g.copy(data_structure='static_sparse') is g.copy(immutable=True)
            True

        If a graph pretends to be immutable, but does not use the static sparse
        backend, then the copy is not identical with the graph, even though it
        is considered to be hashable::

        Optionally, it is possible to add vertex attributes and edge attributes
        to the output graph.

        .. NOTE::

            This routine needs the optional package igraph to be installed:
            to do so, it is enough to run ``sage -i python_igraph``. For more
            information on the Python version of igraph, see
            http://igraph.org/python/.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertex_list`` -- list (default: ``None``); defines a mapping from
          the vertices of the graph to consecutive integers in ``(0, \ldots,
          n-1)`. Otherwise, the result of :meth:`vertices` will be used
          instead. Because :meth:`vertices` only works if the vertices can be
          sorted, using ``vertex_list`` is useful when working with possibly
          non-sortable objects in Python 3.

        - ``vertex_attrs`` -- dictionary (default: ``{}``); a dictionary where
          the key is a string (the attribute name), and the value is an iterable
          containing in position `i` the label of the `i`-th vertex in the list
          ``vertex_list`` if it is given or in :meth:`vertices` when
          ``vertex_list == None`` (see
          http://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html#__init__ for more
          information)

        - ``edge_attrs`` -- dictionary (default: ``{}``); a dictionary where the
          key is a string (the attribute name), and the value is an iterable
          containing in position `i` the label of the `i`-th edge in the list
          outputted by :meth:`edge_iterator` (see
          http://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html#__init__ for more
          information)

        .. NOTE::

            In ``igraph``, a graph is weighted if the edge labels have attribute
            ``weight``. Hence, to create a weighted graph, it is enough to add
            this attribute.

        .. NOTE::

            Often, Sage uses its own defined types for integer/floats. These
            types may not be igraph-compatible (see example below).

        EXAMPLES:

        Standard conversion::

            sage: G = graphs.TetrahedralGraph()
            sage: H = G.igraph_graph()          # optional - python_igraph
            sage: H.summary()                   # optional - python_igraph

            'IGRAPH D--- 3 2 -- '

        Adding edge attributes::

            sage: G = Graph([(1, 2, 'a'), (2, 3, 'b')])
            sage: E = list(G.edge_iterator())
            sage: H = G.igraph_graph(edge_attrs={'label': [e[2] for e in E]}) # optional - python_igraph
            sage: H.es['label']                                               # optional - python_igraph
            ['a', 'b']


        If edges have an attribute ``weight``, the igraph graph is considered
        weighted::

            sage: G = Graph([(1, 2, {'weight': 1}), (2, 3, {'weight': 2})])
            sage: E = list(G.edge_iterator())

            [1, 2]

        Adding vertex attributes::

            sage: G = graphs.GridGraph([2, 2])
            sage: H = G.igraph_graph(vertex_attrs={'name': G.vertices()}) # optional - python_igraph
            sage: H.vs()['name']                                          # optional - python_igraph
            [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

        Providing a mapping from vertices to consecutive integers::

            sage: G = graphs.GridGraph([2, 2])

        OUTPUT:

        The output depends on the input:

        * If ``edge_labels == False`` and ``multiple_edges == False``, the
          output is a dictionary associating to each vertex the list of its
          neighbors.

        * If ``edge_labels == False`` and ``multiple_edges == True``, the output
          is a dictionary the same as previously with one difference: the
          neighbors are listed with multiplicity.

        * If ``edge_labels == True`` and ``multiple_edges == False``, the output
          is a dictionary associating to each vertex `u` [a dictionary
          associating to each vertex `v` incident to `u` the label of edge
          `(u,v)`].

        * If ``edge_labels == True`` and ``multiple_edges == True``, the output
          is a dictionary associating to each vertex `u` [a dictionary
          associating to each vertex `v` incident to `u` [the list of labels of
          all edges between `u` and `v`]].

    def incidence_matrix(self, oriented=None, sparse=True, vertices=None, edges=None):
        r"""
        Return the incidence matrix of the (di)graph.

        Each row is a vertex, and each column is an edge. The vertices are
        ordered as obtained by the method :meth:`vertices`, except when
        parameter ``vertices`` is given (see below), and the edges as obtained
        by the method :meth:`edge_iterator`.

        If the graph is not directed, then return a matrix with entries in
        `\{0,1,2\}`. Each column will either contain two `1` (at the position of
        the endpoint of the edge), or one `2` (if the corresponding edge is a
        loop).

        If the graph is directed return a matrix in `\{-1,0,1\}` where `-1` and
        `+1` correspond respectively to the source and the target of the edge. A
        loop will correspond to a zero column. In particular, it is not possible
        to recover the loops of an oriented graph from its incidence matrix.

        See the :wikipedia:`Incidence_matrix` for more information.

        INPUT:

        - ``oriented`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); when set to ``True``, the
          matrix will be oriented (i.e. with entries in `-1`, `0`, `1`) and if
          set to ``False`` the matrix will be not oriented (i.e. with entries in
          `0`, `1`, `2`). By default, this argument is inferred from the graph
          type.  Note that in the case the graph is not directed and with the
          option ``directed=True``, a somewhat random direction is chosen for
          each edge.

        - ``sparse`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to use a sparse or
          a dense matrix

        - ``vertices`` -- list (default: ``None``); when specified, the `i`-th
          row of the matrix corresponds to the `i`-th vertex in the ordering of
          ``vertices``, otherwise, the `i`-th row of the matrix corresponds to
          the `i`-th vertex in the ordering given by method :meth:`vertices`.

        - ``edges`` -- list (default: ``None``); when specified, the `i`-th
          column of the matrix corresponds to the `i`-th edge in the ordering of
          ``edges``, otherwise, the `i`-th column of the matrix corresponds to
          the `i`-th edge in the ordering given by method :meth:`edge_iterator`.

        Return the distance matrix of (di)graph.

        The (di)graph is expected to be (strongly) connected.

        The distance matrix of a (strongly) connected (di)graph is a matrix
        whose rows and columns are by default (``vertices == None``) indexed
        with the positions of the vertices of the (di)graph in the ordering
        :meth:`vertices`. When ``vertices`` is set, the position of the vertices
        in this ordering is used. The intersection of row `i` and column `j`
        contains the shortest path distance from the vertex at the `i`-th
        position to the vertex at the `j`-th position.

        Note that even when the vertices are consecutive integers starting from
        one, usually the vertex is not equal to its index.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` -- list (default: ``None``); the ordering of the vertices
          defining how they should appear in the matrix. By default, the
          ordering given by :meth:`vertices` is used. Because :meth:`vertices`
          only works if the vertices can be sorted, using ``vertices`` is useful
          when working with possibly non-sortable objects in Python 3.

        r"""
        Return the Kirchhoff matrix (a.k.a. the Laplacian) of the graph.

        The Kirchhoff matrix is defined to be `D + M` if signless and `D - M`
        otherwise, where `D` is the diagonal degree matrix (each diagonal entry
        is the degree of the corresponding vertex), and `M` is the adjacency
        matrix.  If ``normalized`` is ``True``, then the returned matrix is
        `D^{-1/2}(D+M)D^{-1/2}` if signless and `D^{-1/2}(D-M)D^{-1/2}`
        otherwise.

        (In the special case of DiGraphs, `D` is defined as the diagonal
        in-degree matrix or diagonal out-degree matrix according to the value of
        ``indegree``)

        INPUT:

        - ``weighted`` -- boolean (default: ``None``);

          - If ``True``, the weighted adjacency matrix is used for `M`, and the
            diagonal matrix `D` takes into account the weight of edges (replace
            in the definition "degree" by "sum of the incident edges")

          - Else, each edge is assumed to have weight 1

          Default is to take weights into consideration if and only if the graph
          is weighted.

        - ``indegree`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); this parameter is
          considered only for digraphs.

          - If ``True``, each diagonal entry of `D` is equal to the in-degree of
            the corresponding vertex

          - Else, each diagonal entry of `D` is equal to the out-degree of the
            corresponding vertex

          By default, ``indegree`` is set to ``True``

        - ``normalized`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);

          - If ``True``, the returned matrix is `D^{-1/2}(D+M)D^{-1/2}` for
            signless and `D^{-1/2}(D-M)D^{-1/2}` otherwise, a normalized
            version of the Laplacian matrix. More accurately, the normalizing
            matrix used is equal to `D^{-1/2}` only for non-isolated vertices.
            If vertex `i` is isolated, then diagonal entry `i` in the matrix is
            1, rather than a division by zero

          - Else, the matrix `D+M` for signless and `D-M` otherwise is returned

        - ``signless`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);

          - If ``True``, `D+M` is used in calculation of Kirchhoff matrix

          - Else, `D-M` is used in calculation of Kirchhoff matrix

        Note that any additional keywords will be passed on to either the
        ``adjacency_matrix`` or ``weighted_adjacency_matrix`` method.

    def is_eulerian(self, path=False):

        Check whether the graph is Eulerian.

        A graph is Eulerian if it has a (closed) tour that visits each edge
        exactly once.

        INPUT:

        - ``path`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); by default this function
          finds if the graph contains a closed tour visiting each edge once,
          i.e. an Eulerian cycle. If you want to test the existence of an
          Eulerian path, set this argument to ``True``. Graphs with this
          property are sometimes called semi-Eulerian.

        OUTPUT:

        ``True`` or ``False`` for the closed tour case. For an open tour search
        (``path``=``True``) the function returns ``False`` if the graph is not
        semi-Eulerian, or a tuple (u, v) in the other case. This tuple defines
        the edge that would make the graph Eulerian, i.e. close an existing open

    ### Orientations

    def eulerian_orientation(self):
        r"""
        Return a DiGraph which is an Eulerian orientation of the current graph.

        An Eulerian graph being a graph such that any vertex has an even degree,
        an Eulerian orientation of a graph is an orientation of its edges such
        that each vertex `v` verifies `d^+(v)=d^-(v)=d(v)/2`, where `d^+` and
        `d^-` respectively represent the out-degree and the in-degree of a
        vertex.

        If the graph is not Eulerian, the orientation verifies for any vertex
        `v` that `| d^+(v)-d^-(v) | \leq 1`.

        ALGORITHM:

        This algorithm is a random walk through the edges of the graph, which
        orients the edges according to the walk. When a vertex is reached which
        has no non-oriented edge (this vertex must have odd degree), the walk
        resumes at another vertex of odd degree, if any.

        This algorithm has complexity `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of edges
        in the graph.

        EXAMPLES:

        The CubeGraph with parameter 4, which is regular of even degree, has an
        Eulerian orientation such that `d^+ = d^-`::

            sage: g = graphs.CubeGraph(4)
            sage: g.degree()
            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

            [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

        Secondly, the Petersen Graph, which is 3 regular has an orientation such
        that the difference between `d^+` and `d^-` is at most 1::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: o = g.eulerian_orientation()
            sage: o.in_degree()

        Return the edges of a minimum spanning tree.

        At the moment, no algorithm for directed graph is implemented: if the
        graph is directed, a minimum spanning tree of the corresponding
        undirected graph is returned.

        We expect all weights of the graph to be convertible to float.
        Otherwise, an exception is raised.

        INPUT:

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l`` , if ``l``
          is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight. The ``weight_function`` can
          be used to transform the label into a weight (note that, if the weight
          returned is not convertible to a float, an error is raised)

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, the edges
          in the graph are weighted, otherwise all edges have weight 1

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"Prim_Boost"``); the algorithm to
          use in computing a minimum spanning tree of ``G``. The following
          algorithms are supported:

          - ``"Prim_Boost"`` -- Prim's algorithm (Boost implementation)

          - ``"Prim_fringe"`` -- a variant of Prim's algorithm that ignores the
            labels on the edges

          - ``"Prim_edge"`` -- a variant of Prim's algorithm

          - ``"Kruskal"`` -- Kruskal's algorithm

          - ``"Filter_Kruskal"`` -- a variant of Kruskal's algorithm [OSS2009]_

          - ``"Kruskal_Boost"`` -- Kruskal's algorithm (Boost implementation)

          - ``"Boruvka"`` -- Boruvka's algorithm

          - ``NetworkX`` -- uses NetworkX's minimum spanning tree
            implementation

        - ``starting_vertex`` -- a vertex (default: ``None``); the vertex from
          which to begin the search for a minimum spanning tree (available only
          for ``Prim_fringe`` and ``Prim_edge``).

        - ``check`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to first perform
          sanity checks on the input graph ``G``. If appropriate, ``check`` is
          passed on to any minimum spanning tree functions that are invoked from
          the current method. See the documentation of the corresponding
          functions for details on what sort of sanity checks will be performed.

        OUTPUT:

        The edges of a minimum spanning tree of ``G``, if one exists, otherwise
        returns the empty list.

        EXAMPLES:

        Kruskal's algorithm::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
            sage: len(g.min_spanning_tree())
            4
            sage: weight = lambda e: 1 / ((e[0] + 1) * (e[1] + 1))
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 4, None), (1, 4, None), (2, 4, None), (3, 4, None)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=weight, algorithm='Kruskal_Boost'))
            [(0, 4, None), (1, 4, None), (2, 4, None), (3, 4, None)]
            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
            sage: g.add_edges(g.edge_iterator())
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree())
            [(0, 1, None), (0, 4, None), (0, 5, None), (1, 2, None), (1, 6, None), (3, 8, None), (5, 7, None), (5, 8, None), (6, 9, None)]

        Boruvka's algorithm::

            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Boruvka'))
            [(0, 1, None), (0, 4, None), (0, 5, None), (1, 2, None),  (1, 6, None), (2, 3, None), (2, 7, None),  (3, 8, None), (4, 9, None)]

        Prim's algorithm::

            sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Prim_edge', starting_vertex=2, weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 4, None), (1, 4, None), (2, 4, None), (3, 4, None)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Prim_fringe', starting_vertex=2, weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 4, None), (1, 4, None), (2, 4, None), (3, 4, None)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=weight, algorithm='Prim_Boost'))
            [(0, 4, None), (1, 4, None), (2, 4, None), (3, 4, None)]

        NetworkX algorithm::

            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='NetworkX'))
            [(0, 1, None), (0, 2, None), (0, 3, None), (0, 4, None)]

        More complicated weights::

            sage: G = Graph([(0,1,{'name':'a','weight':1}), (0,2,{'name':'b','weight':3}), (1,2,{'name':'b','weight':1})])
            sage: sorted(G.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=lambda e: e[2]['weight']))
            [(0, 1, {'name': 'a', 'weight': 1}), (1, 2, {'name': 'b', 'weight': 1})]

        If the graph is not weighted, edge labels are not considered, even if
        they are numbers::

            sage: g = Graph([(1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 2), (2, 3, 1)])
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree())
            [(1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 2)]

        In order to use weights, we need either to set variable ``weighted`` to
        ``True``, or to specify a weight function or set by_weight to ``True``::

            sage: g.weighted(True)
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree())
            [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1)]
            sage: g.weighted(False)
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree())
            [(1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 2)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(by_weight=True))
            [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=lambda e: e[2]))
            [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1)]

            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Boruvka'))
            [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1)]

        Check that, if ``weight_function`` is provided, it overrides edge
        weights::

            sage: g = Graph([[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 0, 10]], weighted=True)
            sage: weight = lambda e: 3 - e[0] - e[1]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 2, 10), (1, 2, 1)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Filter_Kruskal', weight_function=weight))

            [(0, 2, 10), (1, 2, 1)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Prim_fringe', weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 2, 10), (1, 2, 1)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Prim_edge', weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 2, 10), (1, 2, 1)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Prim_Boost', weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 2, 10), (1, 2, 1)]
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='NetworkX', weight_function=weight))

            [(0, 2, 10), (1, 2, 1)]

        If the graph is directed, it is transformed into an undirected graph::

            sage: g = digraphs.Circuit(3)
            sage: sorted(g.min_spanning_tree(weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 2, None), (1, 2, None)]
            sage: sorted(g.to_undirected().min_spanning_tree(weight_function=weight))
            [(0, 2, None), (1, 2, None)]

    def spanning_trees_count(self, root_vertex=None):
        r"""
        Return the number of spanning trees in a graph.

        In the case of a digraph, counts the number of spanning out-trees rooted
        in ``root_vertex``.  Default is to set first vertex as root.

        This computation uses Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem [1] to calculate
        the number of spanning trees. For complete graphs on `n` vertices the
        result can also be reached using Cayley's formula: the number of
        spanning trees are `n^(n-2)`.

        For digraphs, the augmented Kirchhoff Matrix as defined in [2] is used
        for calculations. Here the result is the number of out-trees rooted at a
        specific vertex.

        INPUT:

        - ``root_vertex`` -- a vertex (default: ``None``); the vertex that will
          be used as root for all spanning out-trees if the graph is a directed
          graph. Otherwise, the first vertex returned by :meth:`vertex_iterator`
          is used. This argument is ignored if the graph is not a digraph.

        r"""
        Return a list of cycles which form a basis of the cycle space of
        ``self``.

        A basis of cycles of a graph is a minimal collection of cycles
        (considered as sets of edges) such that the edge set of any cycle in the
        graph can be written as a `Z/2Z` sum of the cycles in the basis.

        See the :wikipedia:`Cycle_basis` for more information.

        INPUT:

        - ``output`` -- string (default: ``'vertex'``); whether every cycle is
          given as a list of vertices (``output == 'vertex'``) or a list of
          edges (``output == 'edge'``)

        OUTPUT:

        A list of lists, each of them representing the vertices (or the edges)
        of a cycle in a basis.

        ALGORITHM:

        Uses the NetworkX library for graphs without multiple edges.

        Otherwise, by the standard algorithm using a spanning tree.

        EXAMPLES:

        A cycle basis in Petersen's Graph ::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.cycle_basis()
            [[1, 6, 8, 5, 0], [4, 9, 6, 8, 5, 0], [7, 9, 6, 8, 5], [4, 3, 8, 5, 0], [1, 2, 3, 8, 5, 0], [7, 2, 3, 8, 5]]

        One can also get the result as a list of lists of edges::

            sage: g.cycle_basis(output='edge')
            [[(1, 6, None), (6, 8, None), (8, 5, None), (5, 0, None),

            (2, 3, None), (3, 8, None), (8, 5, None), (5, 7, None)]]

            sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(30, .4)
            sage: basis = g.cycle_basis()

        Building the space of (directed) edges over `Z/2Z`. On the way, building
        a dictionary associating a unique vector to each undirected edge::

            ....:    edge_vector[(v, u)] = vec

        Defining a lambda function associating a vector to the vertices of a
        cycle::

            sage: vertices_to_edges = lambda x: zip(x, x[1:] + [x[0]])
            sage: cycle_to_vector = lambda x: sum(edge_vector[e] for e in vertices_to_edges(x))

        Finally checking the cycles are a free set::

            sage: basis_as_vectors = [cycle_to_vector(_) for _ in basis]
            sage: edge_space.span(basis_as_vectors).rank() == len(basis)
            True

            The argument on_embedding takes precedence over

          (clockwise ordering of neighbors at each vertex). This value will only
          be set if a planar embedding is found. It is stored as a Python dict:
          ``v1: [n1,n2,n3]`` where ``v1`` is a vertex and ``n1,n2,n3`` are its
          neighbors.

        Check whether the graph is circular planar (outerplanar)

        A graph is circular planar if it has a planar embedding in which all
        vertices can be drawn in order on a circle. This method can also be used
        to check the existence of a planar embedding in which the vertices of a
        specific set (the *boundary*) can be drawn on a circle, all other
        vertices being drawn inside of the circle. An order can be defined on
        the vertices of the boundary in order to define how they are to appear
        on the circle.

        INPUT:

        - ``on_embedding`` -- dictionary (default: ``None``); the embedding
          dictionary to test planarity on (i.e.: will return ``True`` or
          ``False`` only for the given embedding)

        - ``kuratowski`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return a
          tuple with boolean first entry and the Kuratowski subgraph (i.e. an
          edge subdivision of `K_5` or `K_{3,3}`) as the second entry (see
          OUTPUT below)

        - ``set_embedding`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether or not to
          set the instance field variable that contains a combinatorial
          embedding (clockwise ordering of neighbors at each vertex). This value
          will only be set if a circular planar embedding is found. It is stored
          as a Python dict: ``v1: [n1,n2,n3]`` where ``v1`` is a vertex and
          ``n1,n2,n3`` are its neighbors.

        - ``boundary`` -- list (default: ``None``); an ordered list of vertices
          that are required to be drawn on the circle, all others being drawn
          inside of it. It is set to ``None`` by default, meaning that *all*
          vertices should be drawn on the boundary.

        - ``ordered`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether or not to
          consider the order of the boundary. It required ``boundary`` to be
          defined.

        - ``set_pos`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether or not to set the
          position dictionary (for plotting) to reflect the combinatorial
          embedding. Note that this value will default to ``False`` if
          ``set_embedding`` is set to ``False``. Also, the position dictionary
          will only be updated if a circular planar embedding is found.

        OUTPUT:

        The method returns ``True`` if the graph is circular planar, and
        ``False`` if it is not.

        If ``kuratowski`` is set to ``True``, then this function will return a
        tuple, whose first entry is a boolean and whose second entry is the
        Kuratowski subgraph (i.e. an edge subdivision of `K_5` or `K_{3,3}`)
        isolated by the Boyer-Myrvold algorithm. Note that this graph might
        contain a vertex or edges that were not in the initial graph.  These
        would be elements referred to below as parts of the wheel and the star,
        which were added to the graph to require that the boundary can be drawn
        on the boundary of a disc, with all other vertices drawn inside (and no
        edge crossings).

        ALGORITHM:

        This is a linear time algorithm to test for circular planarity. It
        relies on the edge-addition planarity algorithm due to Boyer-Myrvold. We
        accomplish linear time for circular planarity by modifying the graph
        before running the general planarity algorithm.

          instance field variable that contains a combinatorial embedding to the
          combinatorial embedding used for the planar layout (see
          :meth:`~sage/graphs/generic_graph.GenericGraph.get_embedding`)

        - ``on_embedding`` -- dictionary (default: ``None``); provide a
          combinatorial embedding

        - ``external_face`` -- a pair `(u,v)` of vertices (default: ``None``);
          the external face of the drawing is chosen in such a way that `u` and
          `v` are consecutive vertices in the clockwise traversal of the
          external face, in particular `uv` has to be an edge of the graph. If
          ``external_face == None``, an arbitrary external face is chosen.

        - ``test`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to perform sanity
          tests along the way

        - ``circular`` -- ignored

        Return the minimal genus of the graph.

        The genus of a compact surface is the number of handles it has. The
        genus of a graph is the minimal genus of the surface it can be embedded
        into. It can be seen as a measure of non-planarity; a planar graph has
        genus zero.

        .. NOTE::

            This function uses Euler's formula and thus it is necessary to
            consider only connected graphs.

        INPUT:

        - ``set_embedding`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether or not to
          store an embedding attribute of the computed (minimal) genus of the
          graph

        - ``on_embedding`` -- two kinds of input are allowed (default:
           ``None``):

          - a dictionary representing a combinatorial embedding on which the
            genus should be computed. Note that this must be a valid embedding
            for the graph. The dictionary structure is given by: ``vertex1:
            [neighbor1, neighbor2, neighbor3], vertex2: [neighbor]`` where there
            is a key for each vertex in the graph and a (clockwise) ordered list
            of each vertex's neighbors as values. The value of ``on_embedding``
            takes precedence over a stored ``_embedding`` attribute if
            ``minimal`` is set to ``False``.

          - The value ``True``, in order to indicate that the embedding stored
            as ``_embedding`` should be used (see examples).

        - ``minimal`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether or not to compute
          the minimal genus of the graph (i.e., testing all embeddings). If
          minimal is ``False``, then either ``maximal`` must be ``True`` or
          ``on_embedding`` must not be ``None``. If ``on_embedding`` is not
          ``None``, it will take priority over ``minimal``. Similarly, if
          ``maximal`` is ``True``, it will take priority over ``minimal``.

        - ``maximal`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether or not to compute
          the maximal genus of the graph (i.e., testing all embeddings). If
          ``maximal`` is ``False``, then either ``minimal`` must be ``True`` or
          ``on_embedding`` must not be ``None``. If ``on_embedding`` is not
          ``None``, it will take priority over ``maximal``. However, ``maximal``
          takes priority over the default ``minimal``.

        - ``circular`` -- list (default: ``None``); if ``circular`` is a list of
          vertices, the method computes the genus preserving a planar embedding
          of the this list. If ``circular`` is defined, ``on_embedding`` is not
          a valid option.

        - ``ordered`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``circular`` is
          ``True``, then whether or not the boundary order may be permuted
          (default is ``True``, which means the boundary order is preserved)

        Return the crossing number of the graph.

        The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of edge crossings
        needed to draw the graph on a plane. It can be seen as a measure of
        non-planarity; a planar graph has crossing number zero.

        See the :wikipedia:`Crossing_number` for more information.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: P.crossing_number()
            2

        ALGORITHM:

        This is slow brute force implementation: for every `k` pairs of edges
        try adding a new vertex for a crossing point for them. If the result is
        not planar in any of those, try `k+1` pairs.

        Computing the crossing number is NP-hard problem.

        A combinatorial embedding of a graph is a clockwise ordering of the
        neighbors of each vertex. From this information one can obtain the dual
        of a plane graph, which is what the method returns. The vertices of the
        dual graph correspond to faces of the primal graph.

        r"""
        Return a tree of minimum weight connecting the given set of vertices.

        Definition :

        Computing a minimum spanning tree in a graph can be done in `n \log(n)`
        time (and in linear time if all weights are equal) where `n = V + E`. On
        the other hand, if one is given a large (possibly weighted) graph and a
        subset of its vertices, it is NP-Hard to find a tree of minimum weight
        connecting the given set of vertices, which is then called a Steiner
        Tree.

        See the :wikipedia:`Steiner_tree_problem` for more information.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` -- the vertices to be connected by the Steiner
          Tree.

        - ``weighted`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to consider the
          graph as weighted, and use each edge's label as a weight, considering
          ``None`` as a weight of `1`. If ``weighted=False`` (default) all edges
          are considered to have a weight of `1`.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.


        .. NOTE::

            * This problem being defined on undirected graphs, the orientation
              is not considered if the current graph is actually a digraph.

            * The graph is assumed not to have multiple edges.

        ALGORITHM:

        Solved through Linear Programming.

        COMPLEXITY:

        NP-Hard.

        Note that this algorithm first checks whether the given set of vertices
        induces a connected graph, returning one of its spanning trees if
        ``weighted`` is set to ``False``, and thus answering very quickly in
        some cases

            sage: first5 = g.vertices()[:5]

        Return a minimum edge cut between vertices `s` and `t`.

        A minimum edge cut between two vertices `s` and `t` of self is a set `A`
        of edges of minimum weight such that the graph obtained by removing `A`
        from the graph is disconnected. For more information, see the
        :wikipedia:`Cut_(graph_theory)`.

        INPUT:

        - ``s`` -- source vertex

        - ``t`` -- sink vertex

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to return only
          the weight of a minimum cut (``True``) or a list of edges of a minimum
          cut (``False``)

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          compute a weighted minimum edge cut where the weight of an edge is
          defined by its label (if an edge has no label, `1` is assumed), or to
          compute a cut of minimum cardinality (i.e., edge weights are set to 1)

        - ``vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether set to ``True``,
          return a list of edges in the edge cut and the two sets of vertices
          that are disconnected by the cut

          Note: ``vertices=True`` implies ``value_only=False``.

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``'FF'``); algorithm to use:

          * If ``algorithm = "FF"``, a Python implementation of the
            Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is used

          * If ``algorithm = "LP"``, the problem is solved using Linear
            Programming.

          * If ``algorithm = "igraph"``, the igraph implementation of the
            Goldberg-Tarjan algorithm is used (only available when ``igraph`` is
            installed)

          * If ``algorithm = None``, the problem is solved using the default
            maximum flow algorithm (see :meth:`flow`)

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        .. NOTE::

            The use of Linear Programming for non-integer problems may possibly
            mean the presence of a (slight) numerical noise.

        OUTPUT:

        Real number or tuple, depending on the given arguments (examples are
        given below).

        EXAMPLES:

        A basic application in the Pappus graph::

           sage: g = graphs.PappusGraph()
           sage: g.edge_cut(1, 2, value_only=True)
           3

        Or on Petersen's graph, with the corresponding bipartition of the vertex
        set::

           sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
           sage: g.edge_cut(0, 3, vertices=True)
           [3, [(0, 1, None), (0, 4, None), (0, 5, None)], [[0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]]

        If the graph is a path with randomly weighted edges::

           sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(15)
           sage: for u,v in g.edge_iterator(labels=None):
           ....:    g.set_edge_label(u, v, random())

        The edge cut between the two ends is the edge of minimum weight::

           sage: minimum = min(g.edge_labels())
           sage: minimum == g.edge_cut(0, 14, use_edge_labels=True)
           True
           sage: [value, [e]] = g.edge_cut(0, 14, use_edge_labels=True, value_only=False)
           sage: g.edge_label(e[0], e[1]) == minimum
           True

        The two sides of the edge cut are obviously shorter paths::

           sage: value,edges,[set1,set2] = g.edge_cut(0, 14, use_edge_labels=True, vertices=True)
           sage: g.subgraph(set1).is_isomorphic(graphs.PathGraph(len(set1)))
           True
           sage: g.subgraph(set2).is_isomorphic(graphs.PathGraph(len(set2)))
           True
           sage: len(set1) + len(set2) == g.order()
           True

        TESTS:

        If algorithm is set to an exotic value::

           sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
           sage: g.edge_cut(0, 1, algorithm="Divination")
           Traceback (most recent call last):
           ...
           ValueError: the algorithm argument has to be equal to "FF", "LP", "igraph", or None

        Same result for all three methods::

           sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(20,.3)
           sage: for u,v in g.edges(labels=False):
           ....:    g.set_edge_label(u,v,round(random(),5))
           sage: g.edge_cut(0, 1, algorithm="FF") == g.edge_cut(0, 1, algorithm="LP")
           True
           sage: g.edge_cut(0, 1, algorithm="FF") == g.edge_cut(0, 1, algorithm="igraph") # optional - python_igraph
           True

        Rounded return value when using the LP method::

           sage: g = graphs.PappusGraph()
           sage: g.edge_cut(1, 2, value_only=True, algorithm="LP")
           3

        Return a minimum edge multiway cut.

        A multiway cut for a vertex set `S` in a graph or a digraph `G` is a set
        `C` of edges such that any two vertices `u,v` in `S` are disconnected
        when removing the edges of `C` from `G`.
        ( cf. http://www.d.kth.se/~viggo/wwwcompendium/node92.html )

        Such a cut is said to be minimum when its cardinality (or weight) is
        minimum.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` -- iterable; the set of vertices

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return only
          the size of the minimum multiway cut, or to return the list of edges
          of the multiway cut

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          compute a weighted minimum multiway cut where the weight of an edge is
          defined by its label (if an edge has no label, `1` is assumed), or to
          compute a cut of minimum cardinality (i.e., edge weights are set to 1)

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Of course, a multiway cut between two vertices correspond to a minimum
        edge cut::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.edge_cut(0,3) == g.multiway_cut([0,3], value_only = True)
            True

        As Petersen's graph is `3`-regular, a minimum multiway cut between three
        vertices contains at most `2\times 3` edges (which could correspond to
        the neighborhood of 2 vertices)::

            sage: g.multiway_cut([0,3,9], value_only = True) == 2*3
            True

        In this case, though, the vertices are an independent set.  If we pick
        instead vertices `0,9,` and `7`, we can save `4` edges in the multiway
        cut::

            sage: g.multiway_cut([0,7,9], value_only = True) == 2*3 - 1
            True

        This example, though, does not work in the directed case anymore, as it
        is not possible in Petersen's graph to mutualise edges::

            sage: g = DiGraph(g)
            sage: g.multiway_cut([0,7,9], value_only = True) == 3*3
            True

        Of course, a multiway cut between the whole vertex set contains all the
        edges of the graph::

            sage: C = g.multiway_cut(g.vertices())
            sage: set(C) == set(g.edges())
            True

        INPUT:

          path (the method then returns the longest path ending at ``t``). The
          argument is set to ``None`` by default, which means that no constraint
          is set upon the last vertex in the path.

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          compute a path with maximum weight where the weight of an edge is

          * While the MILP formulation returns an exact answer, the backtrack
            algorithm is a randomized heuristic.

          * As the backtrack algorithm does not support edge weighting, setting

        .. NOTE::

            The length of a path is assumed to be the number of its edges, or
            the sum of their labels (when ``use_edge_labels == True``).

        OUTPUT:

        A subgraph of ``self`` corresponding to a (directed if ``self`` is
        directed) longest path. If ``use_edge_labels == True``, a pair ``weight,
        path`` is returned.

        ALGORITHM:

        Mixed Integer Linear Programming (this problem is known to be NP-Hard).

        EXAMPLES:

        Petersen's graph being hypohamiltonian, it has a longest path of length
        `n - 2`::

            sage: lp.order() >= g.order() - 2

        Return a Hamiltonian path of the current graph/digraph.

        A path is Hamiltonian if it goes through all the vertices exactly
        once. Computing a Hamiltonian path being NP-Complete, this
        algorithm could run for some time depending on the instance.

        When ``use_edge_labels == True``, this method returns either a minimum
        weight hamiltonian path or a maximum weight Hamiltonian path (if
        ``maximize == True``).

        .. SEEALSO::

            - :meth:`~GenericGraph.longest_path`
            - :meth:`~GenericGraph.hamiltonian_cycle`

        INPUT:

        - ``s`` -- vertex (default: ``None``); if specified, then forces the
          source of the path (the method then returns a Hamiltonian path
          starting at ``s``)

        - ``t`` -- vertex (default: ``None``); if specified, then forces the
          destination of the path (the method then returns a Hamiltonian path
          ending at ``t``)

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          compute a weighted hamiltonian path where the weight of an edge is
          defined by its label (a label set to ``None`` or ``{}`` being
          considered as a weight of `1`), or a non-weighted hamiltonian path

        - ``maximize`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to compute a
          minimum (default) or a maximum (when ``maximize == True``) weight
          hamiltonian path. This parameter is considered only if
          ``use_edge_labels == True``.

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"MILP"``); the algorithm the use
          among ``"MILP"`` and ``"backtrack"``; two remarks on this respect:

          * While the MILP formulation returns an exact answer, the backtrack
            algorithm is a randomized heuristic.

          * The backtrack algorithm does not support edge weighting, so setting
            ``use_edge_labels=True`` will force the use of the MILP algorithm.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        A subgraph of ``self`` corresponding to a (directed if ``self`` is
        directed) hamiltonian path. If no hamiltonian path is found, return
        ``None``. If ``use_edge_labels == True``, a pair ``weight, path`` is
        returned.

        Solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP)

        Given a graph (resp. a digraph) `G` with weighted edges, the traveling
        salesman problem consists in finding a Hamiltonian cycle (resp. circuit)
        of the graph of minimum cost.

        This TSP is one of the most famous NP-Complete problems, this function
        can thus be expected to take some time before returning its result.

        INPUT:

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to solve
          the weighted traveling salesman problem where the weight of an edge is
          defined by its label (a label set to ``None`` or ``{}`` being
          considered as a weight of `1`), or the non-weighted version (i.e., the
          Hamiltonian cycle problem)

        - ``maximize`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to compute a
          minimum (default) or a maximum (when ``maximize == True``) weight tour
          (or Hamiltonian cycle). This parameter is considered only if
          ``use_edge_labels == True``.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``constraint_generation`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to
          use constraint generation when solving the Mixed Integer Linear
          Program.

          When ``constraint_generation = None``, constraint generation is used
          whenever the graph has a density larger than 70%.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``verbose_constraints`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          display which constraints are being generated

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        A solution to the TSP, as a ``Graph`` object whose vertex set is `V(G)`,
        and whose edges are only those of the solution.

        ALGORITHM:

        This optimization problem is solved through the use of Linear
        Programming.

        .. NOTE::

            This function is correctly defined for both graph and digraphs. In
            the second case, the returned cycle is a circuit of optimal cost.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Heawood graph is known to be Hamiltonian::

            sage: g = graphs.HeawoodGraph()
            sage: tsp = g.traveling_salesman_problem()
            sage: tsp
            TSP from Heawood graph: Graph on 14 vertices

        The solution to the TSP has to be connected::

            sage: tsp.is_connected()
            True

        It must also be a `2`-regular graph::

            sage: tsp.is_regular(k=2)
            True

        And obviously it is a subgraph of the Heawood graph::

            sage: tsp.is_subgraph(g, induced=False)
            True

        On the other hand, the Petersen Graph is known not to be Hamiltonian::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: tsp = g.traveling_salesman_problem()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            EmptySetError: the given graph is not Hamiltonian

        One easy way to change it is obviously to add to this graph the edges
        corresponding to a Hamiltonian cycle. If we do this by setting the cost
        of these new edges to `2`, while the others are set to `1`, we notice
        that not all the edges we added are used in the optimal solution ::

            sage: for u, v in g.edge_iterator(labels=None):
            ....:    g.set_edge_label(u, v, 1)

            sage: cycle = graphs.CycleGraph(10)
            sage: for u,v in cycle.edges(labels=None, sort=False):
            ....:    if not g.has_edge(u, v):
            ....:        g.add_edge(u, v)
            ....:    g.set_edge_label(u, v, 2)

            sage: tsp = g.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True)
            sage: sum( tsp.edge_labels() ) < 2 * 10
            True

        If we pick `1/2` instead of `2` as a cost for these new edges, they
        clearly become the optimal solution::

            sage: for u, v in cycle.edges(labels=None, sort=False):
            ....:    g.set_edge_label(u,v,1/2)

            sage: tsp = g.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True)
            sage: sum(tsp.edge_labels()) == (1/2) * 10
            True

        Search for a minimum and a maximum weight Hamiltonian cycle::

            sage: G = Graph([(0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 2), (0, 3, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 2), (2, 3, 1)])
            sage: tsp = G.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True, maximize=False)
            sage: print(sum(tsp.edge_labels()))
            4
            sage: tsp = G.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True, maximize=True)
            sage: print(sum(tsp.edge_labels()))
            6

        TESTS:

        Comparing the results returned according to the value of
        ``constraint_generation``. First, for graphs::

            sage: from operator import itemgetter
            sage: n = 20
            sage: g = Graph()
            sage: g.allow_multiple_edges(False)
            sage: for u, v in graphs.RandomGNP(n,.2).edges(labels=False, sort=False):
            ....:      g.add_edge(u, v, ZZ.random_element(1,100000))
            sage: for u, v in graphs.CycleGraph(n).edges(labels=False, sort=False):
            ....:      if not g.has_edge(u, v):
            ....:          g.add_edge(u, v, ZZ.random_element(1,100000))
            sage: v1 = g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation=False, use_edge_labels=True)
            sage: v2 = g.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True)
            sage: sum(v1.edge_labels()) == sum(v2.edge_labels())
            True

        Then for digraphs::

            sage: from operator import itemgetter
            sage: n = 20
            sage: g = DiGraph()
            sage: g.allow_multiple_edges(False)
            sage: for u, v in digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(n, .2).edges(labels=False, sort=False):
            ....:      g.add_edge(u, v, ZZ.random_element(1,100000))
            sage: for u, v in digraphs.Circuit(n).edges(labels=False, sort=False):
            ....:      if not g.has_edge(u, v):
            ....:          g.add_edge(u, v, ZZ.random_element(1,100000))
            sage: v2 = g.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True)
            sage: v1 = g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation=False, use_edge_labels=True)
            sage: sum(v1.edge_labels()) == sum(v2.edge_labels())
            True

        Simple tests for multiple edges and loops::

            sage: G = DiGraph(multiedges=True, loops=True)
            sage: G.is_hamiltonian()

            sage: tsp = G.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True)

            sage: G.is_hamiltonian()
            True
            sage: tsp = G.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True)
            sage: sum(tsp.edge_labels())
            4

        Graphs on 2 vertices::

            sage: Graph([(0, 1), (0, 1)], multiedges=True).is_hamiltonian()
            True
            sage: DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 1)], multiedges=True).is_hamiltonian()

        Return a Hamiltonian cycle/circuit of the current graph/digraph.

        A graph (resp. digraph) is said to be Hamiltonian if it contains as a
        subgraph a cycle (resp. a circuit) going through all the vertices.

        Computing a Hamiltonian cycle/circuit being NP-Complete, this algorithm
        could run for some time depending on the instance.

        ALGORITHM:

        See :meth:`~GenericGraph.traveling_salesman_problem` for 'tsp'
        algorithm and
        :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx.find_hamiltonian` from
        :mod:`sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx` for 'backtrack' algorithm.

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``'tsp'``); one of 'tsp' or
          'backtrack'

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``constraint_generation`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to
          use constraint generation when solving the Mixed Integer Linear
          Program.

          When ``constraint_generation = None``, constraint generation is used
          whenever the graph has a density larger than 70%.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``verbose_constraints`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          display which constraints are being generated

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        If using the ``'tsp'`` algorithm, returns a Hamiltonian cycle/circuit if
        it exists; otherwise, raises a ``EmptySetError`` exception. If using the
        ``'backtrack'`` algorithm, returns a pair ``(B, P)``. If ``B`` is
        ``True`` then ``P`` is a Hamiltonian cycle and if ``B`` is ``False``,
        ``P`` is a longest path found by the algorithm. Observe that if ``B`` is
        ``False``, the graph may still be Hamiltonian.  The ``'backtrack'``
        algorithm is only implemented for undirected graphs.

        .. WARNING::

            The ``'backtrack'`` algorithm may loop endlessly on graphs with
            vertices of degree 1.

        NOTE:

        This function, as :meth:`is_hamiltonian`, computes a Hamiltonian cycle
        if it exists: the user should *NOT* test for Hamiltonicity using
        :meth:`is_hamiltonian` before calling this function, as it would result
        in computing it twice.

        The backtrack algorithm is only implemented for undirected graphs.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Heawood Graph is known to be Hamiltonian ::

            sage: g = graphs.HeawoodGraph()
            sage: g.hamiltonian_cycle()
            TSP from Heawood graph: Graph on 14 vertices

        The Petersen Graph, though, is not ::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.hamiltonian_cycle()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            EmptySetError: the given graph is not Hamiltonian

        Now, using the backtrack algorithm in the Heawood graph ::

            sage: G=graphs.HeawoodGraph()
            sage: G.hamiltonian_cycle(algorithm='backtrack')
            (True, [...])

        And now in the Petersen graph ::

            sage: G=graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: B, P = G.hamiltonian_cycle(algorithm='backtrack')
            sage: B
            False
            sage: len(P)
            10
            sage: G.has_edge(P[0], P[-1])
            False

        Finally, we test the algorithm in a cube graph, which is Hamiltonian ::

            sage: G=graphs.CubeGraph(3)
            sage: G.hamiltonian_cycle(algorithm='backtrack')
            (True, [...])

          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``constraint_generation`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to
          use constraint generation when solving the Mixed Integer Linear
          Program

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        ALGORITHMS:

        (Constraints generation)

        When the parameter ``constraint_generation`` is enabled (default) the
        following MILP formulation is used to solve the problem:

        .. MATH::

            \mbox{Minimize : }&\sum_{v\in G} b_{v}\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\\
            &\forall C\text{ circuits }\subseteq G, \sum_{v\in C}b_{v}\geq 1\\

        As the number of circuits contained in a graph is exponential, this LP
        is solved through constraint generation. This means that the solver is
        sequentially asked to solve the problem, knowing only a portion of the
        circuits contained in `G`, each time adding to the list of its
        constraints the circuit which its last answer had left intact.

        (Another formulation based on an ordering of the vertices)

        When the graph is directed, a second (and very slow) formulation is
        available, which should only be used to check the result of the first
        implementation in case of doubt.

        .. MATH::

            \mbox{Minimize : }&\sum_{v\in G} b_v\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\\
            &\forall (u,v)\in G, d_u-d_v+nb_u+nb_v\geq 0\\
            &\forall u\in G, 0\leq d_u\leq |G|\\

        A brief explanation:

        An acyclic digraph can be seen as a poset, and every poset has a linear
        extension. This means that in any acyclic digraph the vertices can be
        ordered with a total order `<` in such a way that if `(u,v)\in G`, then
        `u<v`.  Thus, this linear program is built in order to assign to each
        vertex `v` a number `d_v\in [0,\dots,n-1]` such that if there exists an
        edge `(u,v)\in G` then either `d_v<d_u` or one of `u` or `v` is removed.
        The number of vertices removed is then minimized, which is the
        objective.

        EXAMPLES:

        The necessary example::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: fvs = g.feedback_vertex_set()
            sage: len(fvs)
            3
            sage: g.delete_vertices(fvs)
            sage: g.is_forest()
            True

        In a digraph built from a graph, any edge is replaced by arcs going in
        the two opposite directions, thus creating a cycle of length two.
        Hence, to remove all the cycles from the graph, each edge must see one
        of its neighbors removed: a feedback vertex set is in this situation a
        vertex cover::

            sage: cycle = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
            sage: dcycle = DiGraph(cycle)
            sage: cycle.vertex_cover(value_only=True)
            3
            sage: feedback = dcycle.feedback_vertex_set()
            sage: len(feedback)
            3
            sage: u,v = next(cycle.edge_iterator(labels=None))
            sage: u in feedback or v in feedback
            True

        For a circuit, the minimum feedback arc set is clearly `1`::

            sage: circuit = digraphs.Circuit(5)
            sage: circuit.feedback_vertex_set(value_only=True) == 1
            True

        TESTS:

        Comparing with/without constraint generation::

            sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(10, .3)
            sage: x = g.feedback_vertex_set(value_only=True)
            sage: y = g.feedback_vertex_set(value_only=True,
            ....:          constraint_generation=False)
            sage: x == y
            True

        Return a maximum flow in the graph from ``x`` to ``y``.

        The returned flow is represented by an optimal valuation of the edges.
        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Max_flow`.

        As an optimization problem, is can be expressed this way :

        .. MATH::

            \mbox{Maximize : }&\sum_{e\in G.edges()} w_e b_e\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\forall v \in G, \sum_{(u,v)\in G.edges()} b_{(u,v)}\leq 1\\
            &\forall x\in G, b_x\mbox{ is a binary variable}

        Observe that the integrality of the flow variables is automatic for all
        available solvers when all capacities are integers.

        INPUT:

        - ``x`` -- source vertex

        - ``y`` -- sink vertex

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to return only
          the value of a maximal flow, or to also return a flow graph (a copy of
          the current graph, such that each edge has the flow using it as a
          label, the edges without flow being omitted)

        - ``integer`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to compute an
          optimal solution under the constraint that the flow going through an
          edge has to be an integer, or without this constraint

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          compute a maximum flow where each edge has a capacity defined by its
          label (if an edge has no label, capacity `1` is assumed), or to use
          default edge capacity of `1`

        - ``vertex_bound`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); when set to
          ``True``, sets the maximum flow leaving a vertex different from `x` to
          `1` (useful for vertex connectivity parameters)

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); the algorithm to use
          among:

          * ``"FF"``, a Python implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
            (only available when ``vertex_bound = False``)

          * ``"LP"``, the flow problem is solved using Linear Programming

          * ``"igraph"``, the ``igraph`` implementation of the Goldberg-Tarjan
            algorithm is used (only available when ``igraph`` is installed and
            ``vertex_bound = False``)

          When ``algorithm = None`` (default), we use ``LP`` if ``vertex_bound =
          True``, otherwise, we use ``igraph`` if it is available, ``FF`` if it
          is not available.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

          Only useful when algorithm ``"LP"`` is used to solve the flow problem.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

          Only useful when algorithm ``"LP"`` is used to solve the flow problem.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

          Only useful when ``algorithm == "LP"`` and ``integer == True``.

        .. NOTE::

            Even though the three different implementations are meant to return
            the same Flow values, they cannot be expected to return the same
            Flow graphs.

            Besides, the use of Linear Programming may possibly mean a (slight)
            numerical noise.

        EXAMPLES:

        Two basic applications of the flow method for the ``PappusGraph`` and the
        ``ButterflyGraph`` with parameter `2` ::

           sage: g=graphs.PappusGraph()
           sage: int(g.flow(1,2))

           sage: int(b.flow(('00', 1), ('00', 2)))
           1

        The flow method can be used to compute a matching in a bipartite graph
        by linking a source `s` to all the vertices of the first set and linking
        a sink `t` to all the vertices of the second set, then computing
        a maximum `s-t` flow ::

            sage: g = DiGraph()
            sage: g.add_edges(('s', i) for i in range(4))
            sage: g.add_edges((i, 4 + j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4))

            sage: flow_graph.delete_vertices(['s', 't'])
            sage: flow_graph.size()
            4

        The undirected case::

            sage: g = Graph()
            sage: g.add_edges(('s', i) for i in range(4))
            sage: g.add_edges((i, 4 + j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4))
            sage: g.add_edges((4 + i, 't') for i in range(4))
            sage: [cardinal, flow_graph] = g.flow('s', 't', integer=True, value_only=False)
            sage: flow_graph.delete_vertices(['s', 't'])

            4

        Return a ``k``-nowhere zero flow of the (di)graph.

        A flow on a graph `G = (V, E)` is a pair `(D, f)` such that `D`
        is an orientation of `G` and `f` is a function on `E` satisfying

        .. MATH::

            \sum_{u \in N^-_D(v)} f(uv) = \sum_{w \in N^+_D(v)} f(vw),
            \ \forall v \in V.

        A ``nowhere zero flow`` on a graph `G = (V, E)` is a flow `(D, f)`
        such that `f(e) \neq 0` for every `e \in E`. For a positive
        integer `k`, a `k`-flow on a graph `G = (V, E)` is a flow `(D, f)`
        such that `f: E \to Z` and `-(k - 1) \leq f(e) \leq k - 1` for
        every `e \in E`. A `k`-flow is positive if `f(e) > 0` for every
        `e \in E`. A `k`-flow which is nowhere zero is called a
        `k`-*nowhere zero flow* (or `k`-NZF).

        The following are equivalent.

        - `G` admits a positive `k`-flow.
        - `G` admits a `k`-NZF.
        - Every orientation of `G` admits a `k`-NZF.

        Furthermore, a (di)graph admits a `k`-NZF if and only if it
        is bridgeless and every bridgeless graph admits a `6`-NZF [Sey1981]_.
        See the :wikipedia:`Nowhere-zero_flow` for more details.

        ALGORITHM:

        If ``self`` is not directed, we search for a `k`-NZF on any orientation
        of ``self`` and then build a positive `k`-NZF by reverting edges with
        negative flow.

        INPUT:

        - ``k`` -- integer (default: ``6``); when set to a positive integer
          `\geq 2`, search for a `k`-nowhere zero flow

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        A digraph with flow values stored as edge labels if a `k`-nowhere zero
        flow is found. If ``self`` is undirected, the edges of this digraph
        indicate the selected orientation. If no feasible solution is found, an
        error is raised.

        Solve a multicommodity flow problem.

        In the multicommodity flow problem, we are given a set of pairs `(s_i,
        t_i)`, called terminals meaning that `s_i` is willing some flow to
        `t_i`.

        Even though it is a natural generalisation of the flow problem this
        version of it is NP-Complete to solve when the flows are required to be
        integer.

        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Multi-commodity_flow_problem`.

        INPUT:

        - ``terminals`` -- a list of pairs `(s_i, t_i)` or triples `(s_i, t_i,
          w_i)` representing a flow from `s_i` to `t_i` of intensity `w_i`. When
          the pairs are of size `2`, an intensity of `1` is assumed.

        - ``integer`` boolean (default: ``True``); whether to require an integer
          multicommodity flow

        - ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          compute a multicommodity flow where each edge has a capacity defined
          by its label (if an edge has no label, capacity `1` is assumed), or to
          use default edge capacity of `1`

        - ``vertex_bound`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to require
          that a vertex can stand at most `1` commodity of flow through it of
          intensity `1`. Terminals can obviously still send or receive several
          units of flow even though ``vertex_bound`` is set to ``True``, as this
          parameter is meant to represent topological properties.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

          Only useful when parameter ``ìnteger`` is ``True``.

        ALGORITHM:

        (Mixed Integer) Linear Program, depending on the value of ``integer``.

        EXAMPLES:

        An easy way to obtain a satisfiable multicommodity flow is to compute a
        matching in a graph, and to consider the paired vertices as terminals ::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: matching = [(u,v) for u,v,_ in g.matching()]
            sage: h = g.multicommodity_flow(matching)
            sage: len(h)
            5

        We could also have considered ``g`` as symmetric and computed the
        multicommodity flow in this version instead. In this case, however edges
        can be used in both directions at the same time::

            sage: h = DiGraph(g).multicommodity_flow(matching)
            sage: len(h)
            5

        An exception is raised when the problem has no solution ::

            sage: h = g.multicommodity_flow([(u,v,3) for u,v in matching])

        Return a list of vertex-disjoint paths between two vertices.

        The vertex version of Menger's theorem asserts that the size of the
        minimum vertex cut between two vertices `s` and `t` (the minimum number
        of vertices whose removal disconnects `s` and `t`) is equal to the
        maximum number of pairwise vertex-independent paths from `s` to `t`.

        This function returns a list of such paths.

        INPUT:

        - ``s,t`` -- two vertices of the graph.

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        r"""
        Return the PageRank of the vertices of ``self``.

        PageRank is a centrality measure earlier used to rank web pages.
        The PageRank algorithm outputs the probability distribution that
        a random walker in the graph visits a vertex.

        See the :wikipedia:`PageRank` for more information.

        INPUT:

        - ``alpha`` -- float (default: ``0.85``); damping parameter for
          PageRank. ``alpha`` is the click-through probability useful for
          preventing sinks. The probability at any step, that an imaginary
          surfer who is randomly clicking on links will continue is a damping
          factor d.

        - ``personalization`` -- dict (default: ``None``); a dictionary keyed
          by vertices associating to each vertex a value. The personalization
          can be specified for a subset of the vertices, if not specified a
          nodes personalization value will be taken as zero. The sum of the
          values must be nonzero.
          By default (``None``), a uniform distribution is used.

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, the edges
          in the graph are weighted, otherwise all edges have weight 1

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l``, if ``l``
          is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``dangling`` -- dict (default: ``None``); a dictionary keyed by a
          vertex the outedge of "dangling" vertices, (i.e., vertices without
          any outedges) points to and the dict value is the weight of that
          outedge. By default, dangling vertices are given outedges according
          to the personalization vector (uniform if not specified). It may be
          common to have the dangling dict to be the same as the personalization
          dict.

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); the algorithm to use in
           computing PageRank of ``G``. The following algorithms are
           supported:

          - ``NetworkX`` -- uses NetworkX's default implementation (Scipy as of 2.6)

          - ``"Scipy"`` -- uses Scipy's PageRank algorithm implementation

          - ``"igraph"`` -- uses igraph's PageRank algorithm implementation

          - ``"None"`` -- uses best implementation available

        OUTPUT: a dictionary containing the PageRank value of each node

        .. NOTE::

            Parameters ``alpha``, ``by_weight`` and ``weight_function`` are common
            to all algorithms. Parameters ``personalization`` and ``dangling``
            are used only by algorithms ``NetworkX``, ``Numpy`` and ``Scipy``.

        Return a list of the vertices.

        INPUT:

        - ``sort`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, vertices are
          sorted according to the default ordering

        - ``key`` -- a function (default: ``None``); a function that takes a
          vertex as its one argument and returns a value that can be used for
          comparisons in the sorting algorithm (we must have ``sort=True``)

          a vertex ``v`` is kept if ``degree(v) == degree``

        - ``vertex_property`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function
          that inputs a vertex and outputs a boolean value, i.e., a vertex
          ``v`` is kept if ``vertex_property(v) == True``

        OUTPUT:

        The list of vertices of the (di)graph.

        .. WARNING::

            Since any object may be a vertex, there is no guarantee that any two
            vertices will be comparable. With default objects for vertices (all
            integers), or when all the vertices are of the same simple type,
            then there should not be a problem with how the vertices will be
            sorted.  However, if you need to guarantee a total order for the
            sorting of the edges, use the ``key`` argument, as illustrated in
            the examples below.


        EXAMPLES::

            sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: P.vertices()
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

        If you do not care about sorted output and you are concerned about the
        time taken to sort, consider the following alternative::

            sage: timeit V = P.vertices()                     # not tested
            625 loops, best of 3: 3.86 [micro]s per loop
            sage: timeit V = P.vertices(sort=False)           # not tested
            625 loops, best of 3: 2.06 [micro]s per loop
            sage: timeit V = list(P.vertex_iterator())        # not tested
            625 loops, best of 3: 2.05 [micro]s per loop
            sage: timeit('V = list(P)')                       # not tested
            625 loops, best of 3: 1.98 [micro]s per loop

        We illustrate various ways to use a ``key`` to sort the list::

            sage: H = graphs.HanoiTowerGraph(3, 3, labels=False)
            sage: H.vertices()

        The discriminant of a polynomial is a function that returns an integer.
        We build a graph whose vertices are polynomials, and use the
        discriminant function to provide an ordering. Note that since functions
        are first-class objects in Python, we can specify precisely the function
        from the Sage library that we wish to use as the key::

            sage: t = polygen(QQ, 't')
            sage: K = Graph({5*t: [t^2], t^2: [t^2+2], t^2+2: [4*t^2-6], 4*t^2-6: [5*t]})
            sage: dsc = sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint.Polynomial_rational_flint.discriminant
            sage: verts = K.vertices(key=dsc)

        Return a :class:`~EdgesView` of edges.

        Each edge is a triple ``(u, v, l)`` where ``u`` and ``v`` are vertices
        and ``l`` is a label. If the parameter ``labels`` is ``False`` then a
        list of couple ``(u, v)`` is returned where ``u`` and ``v`` are
        vertices.

        The returned :class:`~EdgesView` is over the edges incident with any
        vertex given in the parameter ``vertices`` (all edges if ``None``). If
        ``self`` is directed, iterates over outgoing edges only, unless
        parameter ``ignore_direction`` is ``True`` in which case it searches
        across edges in either direction.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` -- object (default: ``None``); a vertex, a list of
          vertices or ``None``

        - ``labels`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``False``, each edge is
          simply a pair ``(u, v)`` of vertices

        - ``sort`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, edges are sorted
          according to the default ordering

        - ``key`` -- a function (default: ``None``); a function that takes an
          edge (a pair or a triple, according to the ``labels`` keyword) as its
          one argument and returns a value that can be used for comparisons in
          the sorting algorithm

        - ``ignore_direction`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); only applies to
           directed graphs. If ``True``, searches across edges in either
           direction.

        - ``sort_vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); only applies to
          undirected graphs. If ``True``, sort the ends of the edges.
          Not sorting the ends is faster.


        OUTPUT: A :class:`~EdgesView`.

        .. WARNING::

            Since any object may be a vertex, there is no guarantee that any two
            vertices will be comparable, and thus no guarantee how two edges may
            compare.  With default objects for vertices (all integers), or when
            all the vertices are of the same simple type, then there should not
            be a problem with how the vertices will be sorted.  However, if you
            need to guarantee a total order for the sorting of the edges, use
            the ``key`` argument, as illustrated in the examples below.

        The default is to sort the returned list in the default fashion, as in
        the above examples. This can be overridden by specifying a key
        function. This first example just ignores the labels in the third
        component of the triple::

            sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
            sage: G.edges(key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
            [(0, 1, None), (1, 2, None), (2, 3, None), (3, 4, None), (0, 4, None)]

        We set the labels to characters and then perform a default sort followed
        by a sort according to the labels::

            sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
            sage: for e in G.edges(sort=False):
            ....:   G.set_edge_label(e[0], e[1], chr(ord('A') + e[0] + 5 * e[1]))
            sage: G.edges(sort=True)
            [(0, 1, 'F'), (0, 4, 'U'), (1, 2, 'L'), (2, 3, 'R'), (3, 4, 'X')]
            sage: G.edges(key=lambda x: x[2])
            [(0, 1, 'F'), (1, 2, 'L'), (2, 3, 'R'), (0, 4, 'U'), (3, 4, 'X')]

        We can restrict considered edges to those incident to a given set::

            sage: for i in graphs.PetersenGraph().edges(vertices=[0]):
            ....:     print(i)
            (0, 1, None)
            (0, 4, None)
            (0, 5, None)
            sage: D = DiGraph({0: [1, 2], 1: [0]})
            sage: for i in D.edges(vertices=[0]):
            ....:     print(i)
            (0, 1, None)
            (0, 2, None)

        Ignoring the direction of edges::

            sage: D = DiGraph({1: [0], 2: [0]})
            sage: D.edges(vertices=0)
            []
            sage: D.edges(vertices=0, ignore_direction=True)
            [(1, 0, None), (2, 0, None)]
            sage: D.edges(vertices=[0], ignore_direction=True)
            [(1, 0, None), (2, 0, None)]

        Not sorting the ends of the edges::

            sage: G = Graph()
            sage: G = Graph()
            sage: G.add_edges([[1,2], [2,3], [0,3]])

    def edge_iterator(self, vertices=None, labels=True, ignore_direction=False, sort_vertices=True):
        r"""
        Return an iterator over edges.

        The iterator returned is over the edges incident with any vertex given
        in the parameter ``vertices``. If the graph is directed, iterates over
        edges going out only. If ``vertices`` is ``None``, then returns an
        iterator over all edges. If ``self`` is directed, returns outgoing edges
        only.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` -- object (default: ``None``); a vertex, a list of
          vertices or ``None``

        - ``labels`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``False``, each edge is
           a tuple `(u,v)` of vertices

        - ``ignore_direction`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); only applies to
           directed graphs. If ``True``, searches across edges in either
           direction.

        - ``sort_vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); only applies to
          undirected graphs. If ``True``, sort the ends of the edges.
          Not sorting the ends is faster.

        .. NOTE::

            It is somewhat safe to modify the graph during iterating.

            ``vertices`` must be specified if modifying the vertices.

            Without multiedges, you can safely use this graph to relabel
            edges or delete some edges. If you add edges, they might later
            appear in the iterator or not
            (depending on the internal order of vertices).

            In case of multiedges, all arcs from one vertex to another are
            internally cached. So the iterator will yield them, even if you delete
            them all after seeing the first one.

        induced by the vertices.

        INPUT:

        - ``inplace`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); using ``inplace=True``
          will simply delete the extra vertices and edges from the current
          graph. This will modify the graph.

        - ``vertices`` -- a single vertex or an iterable container of vertices,
          e.g. a list, set, graph, file or numeric array. If not passed (i.e.,
          ``None``), defaults to the entire graph.

        - ``edges`` -- as with ``vertices``, edges can be a single edge or an
          iterable container of edges (e.g., a list, set, file, numeric array,
          etc.). By default (``edges=None``), all edges are assumed and the
          returned graph is an induced subgraph. In the case of multiple edges,
          specifying an edge as `(u,v)` means to keep all edges `(u,v)`,
          regardless of the label.

        - ``vertex_property`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          inputs a vertex and outputs a boolean value, i.e., a vertex ``v`` in
          ``vertices`` is kept if ``vertex_property(v) == True``

        - ``edge_property`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          inputs an edge and outputs a boolean value, i.e., a edge ``e`` in
          ``edges`` is kept if ``edge_property(e) == True``

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of the following:

          - If ``algorithm="delete"`` or ``inplace=True``, then the graph is
            constructed by deleting edges and vertices

          - If ``algorithm="add"``, then the graph is constructed by building a
            new graph from the appropriate vertices and edges. Implies
            ``inplace=False``.

          - If ``algorithm=None``, then the algorithm is chosen based on the
            number of vertices in the subgraph.

        - ``immutable`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to create a
          mutable/immutable subgraph. ``immutable=None`` (default) means that
          the graph and its subgraph will behave the same way.

        Return the subgraph containing the given vertices and edges.

        The edges also satisfy the ``edge_property``, if it is not ``None``.
        The subgraph is created by creating deleting things that are not needed.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` -- (default: ``None``); an iterable container of
          vertices, e.g. a list, set, graph, file or numeric array. If not
          passed (i.e., ``None``), defaults to the entire graph.

        - ``edges`` -- a single edge or an iterable container of edges (e.g., a
          list, set, file, numeric array, etc.). By default (``edges=None``),
          all edges are assumed and the returned graph is an induced
          subgraph. In the case of multiple edges, specifying an edge as `(u,v)`
          means to keep all edges `(u,v)`, regardless of the label.

        - ``edge_property`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          inputs an edge and outputs a boolean value, i.e., a edge ``e`` in
          ``edges`` is kept if ``edge_property(e) == True``

        - ``inplace`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); using ``inplace=True``
          will simply delete the extra vertices and edges from the current
          graph. This will modify the graph.

        - ``immutable`` -- boolean (default: ``None``); whether to create a
          mutable/immutable subgraph. ``immutable=None`` (default) means that
          the graph and its subgraph will behave the same way.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Petersen graph contains the path graph `P_5`::

             sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
             sage: h1 = g.subgraph_search(graphs.PathGraph(5)); h1
             Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 5 vertices

             sage: I1 = g.subgraph_search(graphs.PathGraph(5), induced=True); I1
             Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 5 vertices
             sage: I1.vertices(); I1.edges(labels=False)
             [0, 1, 2, 3, 8]
             [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 8)]

        It also contains the claw `K_{1,3}`::

             sage: h2 = g.subgraph_search(graphs.ClawGraph()); h2
             Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 4 vertices
             sage: h2.vertices(); h2.edges(labels=False)
             [0, 1, 4, 5]
             [(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5)]
             sage: I2 = g.subgraph_search(graphs.ClawGraph(), induced=True); I2
             Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 4 vertices
             sage: I2.vertices(); I2.edges(labels=False)
             [0, 1, 4, 5]
             [(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5)]

        Of course the induced copies are isomorphic to the graphs we were
        looking for::

             sage: I1.is_isomorphic(graphs.PathGraph(5))
             True
             sage: I2.is_isomorphic(graphs.ClawGraph())
             True

        However, the Petersen graph does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to
        `K_3`::

             sage: g.subgraph_search(graphs.CompleteGraph(3)) is None
             True

        Nor does it contain a nonempty induced subgraph isomorphic to `P_6`::

             sage: g.subgraph_search(graphs.PathGraph(6), induced=True) is None

    def is_chordal(self, certificate=False, algorithm="B"):

        Check whether the given graph is chordal.

        A Graph `G` is said to be chordal if it contains no induced hole (a
        cycle of length at least 4).

        Alternatively, chordality can be defined using a Perfect Elimination
        Order :

        A Perfect Elimination Order of a graph `G` is an ordering `v_1,...,v_n`
        of its vertex set such that for all `i`, the neighbors of `v_i` whose
        index is greater that `i` induce a complete subgraph in `G`. Hence, the
        graph `G` can be totally erased by successively removing vertices whose
        neighborhood is a clique (also called *simplicial* vertices)
        [FG1965]_.

        (It can be seen that if `G` contains an induced hole, then it cannot
        have a perfect elimination order. Indeed, if we write `h_1,...,h_k` the
        `k` vertices of such a hole, then the first of those vertices to be
        removed would have two non-adjacent neighbors in the graph.)

        A Graph is then chordal if and only if it has a Perfect Elimination
        Order.

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return a
          certificate.

          * If ``certificate = False`` (default), returns ``True`` or ``False``
            accordingly.

          * If ``certificate = True``, returns :

            * ``(True, peo)`` when the graph is chordal, where ``peo`` is a
              perfect elimination order of its vertices.

            * ``(False, Hole)`` when the graph is not chordal, where ``Hole`` (a
              ``Graph`` object) is an induced subgraph of ``self`` isomorphic to
              a hole.

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"B"``); the algorithm to choose
          among ``"A"`` or ``"B"`` (see next section). While they will agree on
          whether the given graph is chordal, they cannot be expected to return
          the same certificates.

        ALGORITHM:

        This algorithm works through computing a Lex BFS on the graph, then
        checking whether the order is a Perfect Elimination Order by computing
        for each vertex `v` the subgraph induces by its non-deleted neighbors,
        then testing whether this graph is complete.

        This problem can be solved in `O(m)` [RT1975]_ ( where `m` is the number
        of edges in the graph ) but this implementation is not linear because of
        the complexity of Lex BFS.

        EXAMPLES:

        The lexicographic product of a Path and a Complete Graph
        is chordal ::

            sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(5).lexicographic_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(3))
            sage: g.is_chordal()
            True

        The same goes with the product of a random lobster (which is a tree)
        and a Complete Graph ::

            sage: g = graphs.RandomLobster(10, .5, .5).lexicographic_product(graphs.CompleteGraph(3))
            sage: g.is_chordal()
            True

        The disjoint union of chordal graphs is still chordal::

            sage: (2 * g).is_chordal()
            True

        Let us check the certificate given by Sage is indeed a perfect
        elimination order::

            sage: _, peo = g.is_chordal(certificate=True)
            sage: for v in peo:
            ....:     if not g.subgraph(g.neighbors(v)).is_clique():
            ....:          raise ValueError("this should never happen")
            ....:     g.delete_vertex(v)

        Of course, the Petersen Graph is not chordal as it has girth 5::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.girth()
            5
            sage: g.is_chordal()
            False

        We can even obtain such a cycle as a certificate::

            sage: _, hole = g.is_chordal(certificate=True)
            sage: hole
            Subgraph of (Petersen graph): Graph on 5 vertices
            sage: hole.is_isomorphic(graphs.CycleGraph(5))

        An *interval graph* is one where every vertex can be seen as

        iff the corresponding intervals intersects.

        See the :wikipedia:`Interval_graph` for more information.

        Check whether ``self`` is a (directed) cycle graph.

        We follow the definition provided in [BM2008]_ for undirected graphs. A
        cycle on three or more vertices is a simple graph whose vertices can be
        arranged in a cyclic order so that two vertices are adjacent if they are
        consecutive in the order, and not adjacent otherwise. A cycle on a
        vertex consists of a single vertex provided with a loop and a cycle with
        two vertices consists of two vertices connected by a pair of parallel
        edges. In other words, an undirected graph is a cycle if it is 2-regular
        and connected. The empty graph is not a cycle.

        For directed graphs, a directed cycle, or circuit, on two or more
        vertices is a strongly connected directed graph without loops nor
        multiple edges with has many arcs as vertices. A circuit on a vertex
        consists of a single vertex provided with a loop.

        INPUT:

        - ``directed_cycle`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if set to ``True``
          and the graph is directed, only return ``True`` if ``self`` is a
          directed cycle graph (i.e., a circuit). If set to ``False``, we ignore
          the direction of edges and so opposite arcs become multiple (parallel)
          edges. This parameter is ignored for undirected graphs.

        - ``nodes`` -- an iterable container of vertices (default: ``None``);
          the vertices to inspect. By default, returns data on all vertices in
          graph

        - ``weight`` -- string or boolean (default: ``False``); if it is a
          string it uses the indicated edge property as weight.  ``weight =
          True`` is equivalent to ``weight = 'weight'``

        - ``implementation`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of ``'boost'``,
          ``'sparse_copy'``, ``'dense_copy'``, ``'networkx'`` or ``None``
          (default). In the latter case, the best algorithm available is
          used. Note that only ``'networkx'`` supports directed or weighted
          graphs, and that ``'sparse_copy'`` and ``'dense_copy'`` do not support
          ``node`` different from ``None``

    def distance(self, u, v, by_weight=False):

        The distance is the length of the shortest path from ``u`` to ``v``.

        INPUT:

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``False``, the graph
          is considered unweighted, and the distance is the number of edges in a

        Return the distances between all pairs of vertices.

        INPUT:

        - ``by_weight`` boolean (default: `False``); if ``True``, the edges in
          the graph are weighted; if ``False``, all edges have weight 1.

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of the following
          algorithms:

          - ``'BFS'``: the computation is done through a BFS centered on each
            vertex successively. Works only if ``by_weight==False``.

          - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Cython'``: the Cython implementation of
            the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Works only if ``by_weight==False``.

          - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Python'``: the Python implementation of
            the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Works also with weighted graphs, even
            with negative weights (but no negative cycle is allowed).

          - ``'Dijkstra_NetworkX'``: the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in
            NetworkX. It works with weighted graphs, but no negative weight is
            allowed.

          - ``'Dijkstra_Boost'``: the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in Boost
            (works only with positive weights).

          - ``'Johnson_Boost'``: the Johnson algorithm, implemented in
            Boost (works also with negative weights, if there is no negative
            cycle).

          - ``None`` (default): Sage chooses the best algorithm: ``'BFS'`` if
            ``by_weight`` is ``False``, ``'Dijkstra_Boost'`` if all weights are
            positive, ``'Floyd-Warshall-Cython'`` otherwise.

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l``, if ``l``
          is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``check_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to check that
          the ``weight_function`` outputs a number for each edge.

        OUTPUT:

        A doubly indexed dictionary

        .. NOTE::

            There is a Cython version of this method that is usually much faster
            for large graphs, as most of the time is actually spent building the
            final double dictionary. Everything on the subject is to be found in
            the :mod:`~sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs` module.

        .. NOTE::

            This algorithm simply calls
            :meth:`GenericGraph.shortest_path_all_pairs`, and we suggest to look
            at that method for more information and examples.

    def distance_graph(self, dist):
        r"""
        Return the graph on the same vertex set as the original graph but
        vertices are adjacent in the returned graph if and only if they are at
        specified distances in the original graph.

        INPUT:

        - ``dist`` -- a nonnegative integer or a list of nonnegative integers;
          specified distance(s) for the connecting vertices.  ``Infinity`` may
          be used here to describe vertex pairs in separate components.

        OUTPUT:

        The returned value is an undirected graph.  The vertex set is identical
        to the calling graph, but edges of the returned graph join vertices
        whose distance in the calling graph are present in the input ``dist``.
        Loops will only be present if distance 0 is included.  If the original
        graph has a position dictionary specifying locations of vertices for
        plotting, then this information is copied over to the distance graph.
        In some instances this layout may not be the best, and might even be
        confusing when edges run on top of each other due to symmetries chosen
        for the layout.

        EXAMPLES::

            [0 1 0 1 0 0]
            [1 0 1 0 0 0]

        To obtain the graph where vertices are adjacent if their distance apart
        is ``d`` or less use a ``range()`` command to create the input, using
        ``d + 1`` as the input to ``range``.  Notice that this will include
        distance 0 and hence place a loop at each vertex.  To avoid this, use
        ``range(1, d + 1)``::

        that sum to the matrix of all ones::

            True

        Four-bit strings differing in one bit is the same as
        four-bit strings differing in three bits::

            sage: G.is_isomorphic(H)

        Return the closeness centrality of all vertices in ``vert``.

        In a (strongly) connected graph, the closeness centrality of a vertex
        `v` is equal to the inverse of the average distance between `v` and
        other vertices.  If the graph is disconnected, the closeness centrality
        of `v` is multiplied by the fraction of reachable vertices in the graph:
        this way, central vertices should also reach several other vertices in
        the graph [OLJ2014]_. In formulas,

        .. MATH::

            c(v)=\frac{r(v)-1}{\sum_{w \in R(v)} d(v,w)}\frac{r(v)-1}{n-1}

        where `R(v)` is the set of vertices reachable from `v`, and `r(v)` is
        the cardinality of `R(v)`.

        'Closeness centrality may be defined as the total graph-theoretic
        distance of a given vertex from all other vertices... Closeness is an
        inverse measure of centrality in that a larger value indicates a less
        central actor while a smaller value indicates a more central actor,'
        [Bor1995]_.

        For more information, see the :wikipedia:`Centrality`.

        INPUT:

        - ``vert`` -- the vertex or the list of vertices we want to analyze. If
          ``None`` (default), all vertices are considered.

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, the edges
          in the graph are weighted, and otherwise all edges have weight 1

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of the following
          algorithms:

          - ``'BFS'``: performs a BFS from each vertex that has to be analyzed.
            Does not work with edge weights.

          - ``'NetworkX'``: the NetworkX algorithm (works only with positive
            weights).

          - ``'Dijkstra_Boost'``: the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in Boost
            (works only with positive weights).

          - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Cython'``: the Cython implementation of the
            Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Works only if ``by_weight==False`` and all
            centralities are needed.

          - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Python'``: the Python implementation of the
            Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Works only if all centralities are needed,
            but it can deal with weighted graphs, even with negative weights
            (but no negative cycle is allowed).

          - ``'Johnson_Boost'``: the Johnson algorithm, implemented in Boost
            (works also with negative weights, if there is no negative cycle).

          - ``None`` (default): Sage chooses the best algorithm: ``'BFS'`` if
            ``by_weight`` is ``False``, ``'Dijkstra_Boost'`` if all weights are
            positive, ``'Johnson_Boost'`` otherwise.

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l`` as a
          weight, if ``l`` is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``check_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, we check
          that the ``weight_function`` outputs a number for each edge.

        OUTPUT:

        If ``vert`` is a vertex, the closeness centrality of that vertex.
        Otherwise, a dictionary associating to each vertex in ``vert`` its
        closeness centrality. If a vertex has (out)degree 0, its closeness
        centrality is not defined, and the vertex is not included in the output.

        In a (strongly) connected (di)graph, the closeness centrality of `v`
        is inverse of the average distance between `v` and all other vertices::

          - ``'matrix'`` uses the trace of the cube of the adjacency matrix

          - ``'iter'`` iterates over the pairs of neighbors of each vertex. No
            copy of the graph is performed

          - ``None`` -- for undirected graphs, uses ``"sparse_copy"`` or
            ``"dense_copy"`` depending on whether the graph is stored as dense
            or sparse. For directed graphs, uses ``'iter'``.

        EXAMPLES:

        The Petersen graph is triangle free and thus::

            sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: G.triangles_count()
            0

        Any triple of vertices in the complete graph induces a triangle so we
        have::

            sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(15)
            sage: G.triangles_count() == binomial(15, 3)
            True

        The 2-dimensional DeBruijn graph of 2 symbols has 2 directed `C_3`::

            sage: G = digraphs.DeBruijn(2,2)
            sage: G.triangles_count()
            2

        The directed `n`-cycle is trivially triangle free for `n > 3`::

            sage: G = digraphs.Circuit(10)
            sage: G.triangles_count()
            0

        If there is no path from `u` to `v`, the returned list is empty.

        For more information and more examples, see
        :meth:`~GenericGraph.shortest_paths` (the inputs are very similar).

        INPUT:

        - ``u``, ``v`` -- the start and the end vertices of the paths

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, the edges
          in the graph are weighted, otherwise all edges have weight 1

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of the following
          algorithms:

          - ``'BFS'``: performs a BFS from ``u``. Does not work with edge
            weights.

          - ``'BFS_Bid'``: performs a BFS from ``u`` and from ``v``. Does not
            work with edge weights.

          - ``'Dijkstra_NetworkX'``: the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in
            NetworkX. Works only with positive weights.

          - ``'Dijkstra_Bid_NetworkX'``: performs a Dijkstra visit from ``u``
            and from ``v`` (NetworkX implementation). Works only with positive
            weights.

          - ``'Dijkstra_Bid'``: a Cython implementation that performs
            a Dijkstra visit from ``u`` and from ``v``. Works only with positive
            weights.

          - ``'Bellman-Ford_Boost'``: the Bellman-Ford algorithm, implemented in
            Boost. Works also with negative weights, if there is no negative
            cycle.

          - ``None`` (default): Sage chooses the best algorithm: ``'BFS_Bid'``
            if ``by_weight`` is ``False``, ``'Dijkstra_Bid'`` otherwise.

          .. NOTE::

              If there are negative weights and algorithm is ``None``, the
              result is not reliable. This occurs because, for performance
              reasons, we cannot check whether there are edges with negative
              weights before running the algorithm. If there are, the user
              should explicitly input ``algorithm='Bellman-Ford_Boost'``.

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l``, if ``l``
          is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``check_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, we check
          that the weight_function outputs a number for each edge

        An edge weight function is a function that takes as input an edge and

        This method is a helper function for methods using the weight of edges.
        It either checks the validity of an input weight function, or returns a

            There is a Cython version of this method that is usually much faster
            for large graphs, as most of the time is actually spent building the
            final double dictionary. Everything on the subject is to be found in
            the :mod:`~sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs` module.

            sage: G = Graph( { 0: {1: {'weight':1}}, 1: {2: {'weight':1}}, 2: {3: {'weight':1}}, 3: {4: {'weight':2}}, 4: {0: {'weight':2}} }, sparse=True)
            sage: dist, pred = G.shortest_path_all_pairs(weight_function = lambda e:e[2]['weight'])
            sage: dist
            {0: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2}, 1: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3}, 2: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 3}, 3: {0: 3, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 2}, 4: {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 0}}
            sage: pred
            {0: {0: None, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 0}, 1: {0: 1, 1: None, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 0}, 2: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: None, 3: 2, 4: 3}, 3: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: None, 4: 3}, 4: {0: 4, 1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: None}}

        So for example the shortest weighted path from `0` to `3` is obtained as
        follows. The predecessor of `3` is ``pred[0][3] == 2``, the predecessor
        of `2` is ``pred[0][2] == 1``, and the predecessor of `1` is
        ``pred[0][1] == 0``.

        r"""
        Return the Wiener index of ``self``.

        The graph is expected to have no cycles of negative weight.

        The Wiener index of a undirected graph `G` is `W(G) = \frac{1}{2}
        \sum_{u,v\in G} d(u,v)` where `d(u,v)` denotes the distance between
        vertices `u` and `v` (see [KRG1996]_).

        The Wiener index of a directed graph `G` is defined as the sum of the
        distances between each pairs of vertices, i.e.,
        `W(G) = \sum_{u,v\in G} d(u,v)`.

        For more information on the input variables and more examples, we refer
        to :meth:`~GenericGraph.shortest_paths` and
        :meth:`~GenericGraph.shortest_path_all_pairs`, which have very similar
        input variables.

        INPUT:

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, the edges
          in the graph are weighted, otherwise all edges have weight 1

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of the following
          algorithms:

          - For ``by_weight==False`` only:

            - ``'BFS'`` - the computation is done through a BFS centered on
              each vertex successively.

            - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Cython'`` - the Cython implementation of
              the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Usually slower than ``'BFS'``.

          - For graphs without negative weights:

            - ``'Dijkstra_Boost'``: the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in
              Boost.

            - ``'Dijkstra_NetworkX'``: the Dijkstra algorithm, implemented in
              NetworkX. Usually slower than ``'Dijkstra_Boost'``.

          - For graphs with negative weights:

            - ``'Bellman-Ford_Boost'``: the Bellman-Ford algorithm, implemented
              in Boost.

            - ``'Johnson_Boost'``: the Johnson algorithm, implemented in
              Boost.

            - ``'Floyd-Warshall-Python'`` - the Python implementation of
              the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Usually slower than
              ``'Johnson_Boost'``.

          - ``None`` (default): Sage chooses the best algorithm: ``'BFS'`` for
            unweighted graphs, ``'Dijkstra_Boost'`` if all weights are
            positive, ``'Johnson_Boost'``, otherwise.

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l`` as a
          weight, if ``l`` is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``check_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, we check
          that the weight_function outputs a number for each edge

        .. NOTE::

            Some algorithms (e.g., Boost algorithms) use floating point numbers
            for internal computations. Whenever the solution is integral, we try
            to convert the returned value to an integer.

        EXAMPLES::

        Return the average distance between vertices of the graph.

        Formally, for a graph `G` this value is equal to `\frac 1 {n(n-1)}
        \sum_{u,v\in G} d(u,v)` where `d(u,v)` denotes the distance between
        vertices `u` and `v` and `n` is the number of vertices in `G`.

        For more information on the input variables and more examples, we refer
        to :meth:`~GenericGraph.wiener_index` and
        :meth:`~GenericGraph.shortest_path_all_pairs`,
        which have very similar input variables.

        INPUT:

        - ``by_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, the edges
          in the graph are weighted, otherwise all edges have weight 1

        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``None``); one of the
          algorithms available for method :meth:`~GenericGraph.wiener_index`

        - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
          takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If not
          ``None``, ``by_weight`` is automatically set to ``True``. If ``None``
          and ``by_weight`` is ``True``, we use the edge label ``l``, if ``l``
          is not ``None``, else ``1`` as a weight.

        - ``check_weight`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, we check
          that the weight_function outputs a number for each edge

        Return an iterator over the vertices in a breadth-first ordering.

        INPUT:

        - ``start`` -- vertex or list of vertices from which to start the
          traversal

        - ``ignore_direction`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); only applies to
          directed graphs. If ``True``, searches across edges in either
          direction.

        - ``distance`` -- integer (default: ``None``); the maximum distance from
          the ``start`` nodes to traverse. The ``start`` nodes are at distance
          zero from themselves.

        - ``neighbors`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that inputs
          a vertex and return a list of vertices. For an undirected graph,
          ``neighbors`` is by default the :meth:`.neighbors` function. For a
          digraph, the ``neighbors`` function defaults to the
          :meth:`~DiGraph.neighbor_out_iterator` function of the graph.

        - ``report_distance`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``,
          reports pairs ``(vertex, distance)`` where ``distance`` is the
          distance from the ``start`` nodes. If ``False`` only the vertices are
          reported.

        - ``edges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return the edges
          of the BFS tree in the order of visit or the vertices (default).
          Edges are directed in root to leaf orientation of the tree.

          Note that parameters ``edges`` and ``report_distance`` cannot be
          ``True`` simultaneously.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = Graph({0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: [0]})
            sage: list(G.breadth_first_search(0))
            [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]

        By default, the edge direction of a digraph is respected, but this
        can be overridden by the ``ignore_direction`` parameter::

            sage: D = DiGraph({0: [1, 2, 3], 1: [4, 5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(0))
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(0, ignore_direction=True))
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]

        You can specify a maximum distance in which to search. A distance of
        zero returns the ``start`` vertices::

            sage: D = DiGraph({0: [1, 2, 3], 1: [4, 5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(0, distance=0))
            [0]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(0, distance=1))
            [0, 1, 2, 3]

        Multiple starting vertices can be specified in a list::

            sage: D = DiGraph({0: [1, 2, 3], 1: [4, 5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search([0]))
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search([0, 6]))
            [0, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search([0, 6], distance=0))
            [0, 6]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search([0, 6], distance=1))
            [0, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(6, ignore_direction=True, distance=2))
            [6, 3, 7, 0, 5]

        More generally, you can specify a ``neighbors`` function. For example,
        you can traverse the graph backwards by setting ``neighbors`` to be the
        :meth:`.neighbors_in` function of the graph::

            sage: D = DiGraph({0: [1, 2, 3], 1: [4, 5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(5, neighbors=D.neighbors_in, distance=2))
            [5, 1, 2, 0]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(5, neighbors=D.neighbors_out, distance=2))
            [5, 7, 0]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(5 ,neighbors=D.neighbors, distance=2))
            [5, 1, 2, 7, 0, 4, 6]

        It is possible (:trac:`16470`) using the keyword ``report_distance`` to
        get pairs ``(vertex, distance)`` encoding the distance from the starting
        vertices::

            sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: list(G.breadth_first_search(0, report_distance=True))
            [(0, 0), (1, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (2, 2), (6, 2), (3, 2), (9, 2),
            (7, 2), (8, 2)]
            sage: list(G.breadth_first_search(0, report_distance=False))
            [0, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 8]

            sage: D = DiGraph({0: [1, 3], 1: [0, 2], 2: [0, 3], 3: [4]})
            sage: D.show()
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(4, neighbors=D.neighbor_in_iterator, report_distance=True))
            [(4, 0), (3, 1), (0, 2), (2, 2), (1, 3)]

            sage: C = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
            sage: list(C.breadth_first_search([0, 1], report_distance=True))
            [(0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1)]

        You can get edges of the BFS tree instead of the vertices using the
        ``edges`` parameter::

            sage: D = DiGraph({1:[2,3],2:[4],3:[4],4:[1],5:[2,6]})
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(1, edges=True))

          traversal

        - ``ignore_direction`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); only applies to
          directed graphs. If ``True``, searches across edges in either
          direction.

        - ``neighbors`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that inputs
          a vertex and return a list of vertices. For an undirected graph,
          ``neighbors`` is by default the :meth:`.neighbors` function. For a
          digraph, the ``neighbors`` function defaults to the
          :meth:`~DiGraph.neighbor_out_iterator` function of the graph.

        - ``edges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return the edges
          of the DFS tree in the order of visit or the vertices (default).
          Edges are directed in root to leaf orientation of the tree.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = Graph({0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: [0]})
            sage: list(G.depth_first_search(0))
            [0, 4, 3, 2, 1]

        By default, the edge direction of a digraph is respected, but this can
        be overridden by the ``ignore_direction`` parameter::


            sage: D = DiGraph({0: [1, 2, 3], 1: [4, 5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search(0))
            [0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 5, 1, 4]
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search(0, ignore_direction=True))
            [0, 7, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4]

        Multiple starting vertices can be specified in a list::

            sage: D = DiGraph({0: [1, 2, 3], 1: [4, 5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search([0]))
            [0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 5, 1, 4]
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search([0, 6]))
            [0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 5, 1, 4]

        More generally, you can specify a ``neighbors`` function.  For example,
        you can traverse the graph backwards by setting ``neighbors`` to be the
        :meth:`.neighbors_in` function of the graph::

            sage: D = digraphs.Path(10)
            sage: D.add_path([22, 23, 24, 5])
            sage: D.add_path([5, 33, 34, 35])
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search(5, neighbors=D.neighbors_in))
            [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 24, 23, 22]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(5, neighbors=D.neighbors_in))
            [5, 24, 4, 23, 3, 22, 2, 1, 0]
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search(5, neighbors=D.neighbors_out))
            [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 33, 34, 35]
            sage: list(D.breadth_first_search(5, neighbors=D.neighbors_out))
            [5, 33, 6, 34, 7, 35, 8, 9]

        You can get edges of the DFS tree instead of the vertices using the
        ``edges`` parameter::

            sage: D = digraphs.Path(5)
            sage: list(D.depth_first_search(2, edges=True))
            [(2, 3), (3, 4)]

        The transitive closure of a graph `G` has an edge `(x, y)` if and only
        if there is a path between `x` and `y` in `G`.

        The transitive closure of any (strongly) connected component of a
        (di)graph is a complete graph. The transitive closure of a directed
        acyclic graph is a directed acyclic graph representing the full partial
        order.

        .. NOTE::

            If the (di)graph allows loops, its transitive closure will by
            default have one loop edge per vertex. This can be prevented by
            disallowing loops in the (di)graph (``self.allow_loops(False)``).

        Coloring of the edges according to their label for plotting

        INPUT:

        - ``format`` -- "rgbtuple", "hex", ``True`` (same as "hex"), or a
          function or dictionary assigning colors to labels (default: "hex")

        - ``default_color`` -- a string (default: ``"black"``); the color of the
          labels. Setting ``default_color=None`` is the same as
          ``default_color="black"``.

        - ``as_function`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return the
          coloring as a function assigning a color to each label, or as a
          dictionary mapping colors to list of edges

        OUTPUT: A coloring of the edges of this graph.

        If ``as_function`` is ``True``, then the coloring is returned as a
        function assigning a color to each label. Otherwise (the default, for
        backward compatibility), the coloring is returned as a dictionary
        assigning to each color the list of the edges of the graph of that
        color.

        This is factored out from plot() for use in 3d plots, etc.

        If ``format`` is a function, then it is used directly as
        coloring. Otherwise, for each label a default color is chosen along a
        rainbow (see :func:`sage.plot.colors.rainbow`). If ``format`` is a
        dictionary, then the colors specified there override the default
        choices.

        EXAMPLES:

        We consider the Cayley graph of the symmetric group, whose edges are
        labelled by the numbers 1,2, and 3::

            sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4).cayley_graph()
            sage: set(G.edge_labels())
            {1, 2, 3}

        We first request the coloring as a function::

            sage: f = G._color_by_label(as_function=True)
            sage: [f(1), f(2), f(3)]

            sage: [f(1), f(2), f(3)]
            ['red', 'blue', 'blue']

        The default output is a dictionary assigning edges to colors::

            sage: G._color_by_label()
            {'#0000ff': [((), (1,2), 1), ...],
             '#00ff00': [((), (3,4), 3), ...],

            option dim : The dimension of the layout -- 2 or 3.
            option forest_roots : An iterable specifying which vertices to use as roots for the ``layout='forest'`` option. If no root is specified for a tree, then one is chosen close to the center of the tree. Ignored unless ``layout='forest'``.

            option iterations : The number of times to execute the spring layout algorithm.
            option layout : A layout algorithm -- one of : "acyclic", "circular" (plots the graph with vertices evenly distributed on a circle), "ranked", "graphviz", "planar", "spring" (traditional spring layout, using the graph's current positions as initial positions), or "tree" (the tree will be plotted in levels, depending on minimum distance for the root).
            option prog : Which graphviz layout program to use -- one of "circo", "dot", "fdp", "neato", or "twopi".

            option spring : Use spring layout to finalize the current layout.
            option tree_orientation : The direction of tree branches -- 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right'.
            option tree_root : A vertex designation for drawing trees. A vertex of the tree to be used as the root for the ``layout='tree'`` option. If no root is specified, then one is chosen close to the center of the tree. Ignored unless ``layout='tree'``.

        Return an ordered tree layout for this graph.

        The graph must be a tree (no non-oriented cycles). In case of doubt
        whether the graph is connected or not, prefer
        :meth:`~GenericGraph.layout_forest`.

        INPUT:

        - ``tree_root`` -- a vertex (default: ``None``); the root vertex of the
          tree. By default (``None``) a vertex is chosen close to the center of
          the tree.

        - ``tree_orientation`` -- string (default: ``'down'``); the direction in
          which the tree is growing, can be ``'up'``, ``'down'``, ``'left'`` or
          ``'right'``

        - ``dim`` -- integer (default: ``2``); the number of dimensions of the
          layout, 2 or 3

        - ``**options`` -- other parameters not used here

        If the tree has been given a planar embedding (fixed circular order on
        the set of neighbors of every vertex) using ``set_embedding``, the
        algorithm will create a layout that respects this embedding.

          http://graphviz.org.

        - Install ``dot2tex`` with ``sage -i dot2tex``

        - ``shift`` -- (default: 0); rotation of the circle. A value of
          ``shift=1`` will replace in the drawing the `i`-th element of the list
          by the `(i-1)`-th. Non-integer values are admissible, and a value of
          `\alpha` corresponds to a rotation of the circle by an angle of

          instance, when ``angle == 0``, the first vertex get position
          ``(center[0] + radius, center[1])``. With a value of `\pi/2`, the

        Set some vertices on a line in the embedding of this graph.

        By default, this method modifies the graph's embedding so that the
        vertices of ``vertices`` appear on a line, where the position of
        ``vertices[0]`` is the pair ``first`` and the position of
        ``vertices[-1]`` is ``last``. The vertices are evenly spaced.

        INPUT:

        - ``vertices`` -- an iterable container of vertices (list, set, dict,
          etc.). The order of the vertices in the line embedding is given by
          ``list(vertices)``.

        - ``first`` -- tuple (default: `(0, 0)`); first coordinate of the line.

        - ``last`` -- tuple (default: `(0, 1)`); last coordinate of the line.

        - ``return_dict`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); by default the
          computed positions of the specified vertices are stored in the
          position dictionary of the graph. When ``return_dict == True``, a
          dictionary containing only the position of the specified vertices is
          returned.

        INPUT:

        - ``pos`` -- an optional positioning dictionary

        - ``layout`` -- string (default: ``None``); specifies a kind of layout
          to use, takes precedence over pos

          - ``'circular'`` -- plots the graph with vertices evenly distributed
            on a circle

          - ``'spring'`` -- uses the traditional spring layout, using the
            graph's current positions as initial positions

          - ``'tree'`` -- the (di)graph must be a tree. One can specify the root
            of the tree using the keyword tree_root, otherwise a root will be
            selected at random. Then the tree will be plotted in levels,
            depending on minimum distance for the root.

        - ``vertex_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to print
          vertex labels

        - ``edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to print edge
          labels. If ``True``, the result of ``str(l)`` is printed on the edge
          for each label `l`. Labels equal to ``None`` are not printed (to set
          edge labels, see :meth:`set_edge_label`).

        - ``edge_labels_background`` -- the color of the edge labels
          background. The default is "white". To achieve a transparent
          background use "transparent".

        - ``vertex_size`` -- size of vertices displayed

        - ``vertex_shape`` -- the shape to draw the vertices, for example
          ``"o"`` for circle or ``"s"`` for square. Whole list is available at
          https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html.
          (Not available for multiedge digraphs.)

        - ``graph_border`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to include a
          box around the graph

        - ``vertex_colors`` -- dictionary (default: ``None``); optional
          dictionary to specify vertex colors: each key is a color recognizable
          by matplotlib, and each corresponding entry is a list of vertices. If
          a vertex is not listed, it looks invisible on the resulting plot (it
          doesn't get drawn).

        - ``edge_colors`` -- dictionary (default: ``None``); a dictionary
          specifying edge colors: each key is a color recognized by matplotlib,
          and each entry is a list of edges.

        - ``partition`` -- a partition of the vertex set (default: ``None``); if
          specified, plot will show each cell in a different color.
          ``vertex_colors`` takes precedence.

        - ``talk`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, prints large
          vertices with white backgrounds so that labels are legible on slides

        - ``iterations`` -- integer; how many iterations of the spring layout
          algorithm to go through, if applicable

        - ``color_by_label`` -- a boolean or dictionary or function (default:
          ``False``); whether to color each edge with a different color
          according to its label; the colors are chosen along a rainbow, unless
          they are specified by a function or dictionary mapping labels to
          colors; this option is incompatible with ``edge_color`` and
          ``edge_colors``.

        - ``heights`` -- dictionary (default: ``None``); if specified, this is a
          dictionary from a set of floating point heights to a set of vertices

        - ``edge_style`` -- keyword arguments passed into the edge-drawing
          routine.  This currently only works for directed graphs, since we pass
          off the undirected graph to networkx

        - ``tree_root`` -- a vertex (default: ``None``); if specified, this
          vertex is used as the root for the ``layout="tree"`` option.
          Otherwise, then one is chosen at random. Ignored unless
          ``layout='tree'``.

        - ``tree_orientation`` -- string (default: ``"down"``); one of "up" or
          "down".  If "up" (resp., "down"), then the root of the tree will
          appear on the bottom (resp., top) and the tree will grow upwards
          (resp. downwards). Ignored unless ``layout='tree'``.

        - ``save_pos`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); save position computed
          during plotting

        Return a representation in the ``dot`` language.

        The ``dot`` language is a text based format for graphs. It is used by
        the software suite ``graphviz``. The specifications of the language are
        available on the web (see the reference [dotspec]_).

        INPUT:

        - ``labels`` -- string (default: ``"string"``); either ``"string"`` or
          ``"latex"``. If labels is ``"string"``, latex commands are not
          interpreted. This option stands for both vertex labels and edge
          labels.

        - ``vertex_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to add the
          labels on vertices

        - ``edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to add the
          labels on edges

        - ``edge_color`` -- (default: ``None``); specify a default color for the
          edges. The color could be one of

          - a name given as a string such as ``"blue"`` or ``"orchid"``

          - a HSV sequence in a string such as ``".52,.386,.22"``

          - an hexadecimal code such as ``"#DA3305"``

          - a 3-tuple of floating point (to be interpreted as RGB tuple). In
            this case the 3-tuple is converted in hexadecimal code.

        - ``edge_colors`` -- dictionary (default: ``None``); a dictionary whose
          keys are colors and values are list of edges. The list of edges need
          not to be complete in which case the default color is used. See the
          option ``edge_color`` for a description of valid color formats.

        - ``color_by_label`` -- a boolean or dictionary or function (default:
          ``False``); whether to color each edge with a different color
          according to its label; the colors are chosen along a rainbow, unless
          they are specified by a function or dictionary mapping labels to
          colors; this option is incompatible with ``edge_color`` and
          ``edge_colors``.  See the option ``edge_color`` for a description of
          valid color formats.

        - ``edge_options`` -- a function (or tuple thereof) mapping edges to a
          dictionary of options for this edge

        - ``rankdir`` -- ``'left'``, ``'right'``, ``'up'``, or ``'down'``
          (default: ``'down'``, for consistency with ``graphviz``): the
          preferred ranking direction for acyclic layouts; see the ``rankdir``
          option of ``graphviz``.

        - ``subgraph_clusters`` -- a list of lists of vertices (default:
          ``[]``); From [dotspec]_: "If supported, the layout engine will do the
          layout so that the nodes belonging to the cluster are drawn together,
          with the entire drawing of the cluster contained within a bounding
          rectangle. Note that, for good and bad, cluster subgraphs are not part
          of the ``dot`` language, but solely a syntactic convention adhered to
          by certain of the layout engines."

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = Graph({0: {1: None, 2: None}, 1: {0: None, 2: None}, 2: {0: None, 1: None, 3: 'foo'}, 3: {2: 'foo'}}, sparse=True)

        By default ``graphviz`` renders digraphs using a hierarchical layout,
        ranking the vertices down from top to bottom. Here we specify
        alternative ranking directions for this layout::

            sage: D = DiGraph([(1, 2)])
            sage: print(D.graphviz_string(rankdir="up"))
            digraph {
              rankdir=BT
              node_0  [label="1"];
              node_1  [label="2"];
            <BLANKLINE>
              node_0 -> node_1;
            }
            sage: print(D.graphviz_string(rankdir="down"))
            digraph {
              node_0  [label="1"];
              node_1  [label="2"];
            <BLANKLINE>
              node_0 -> node_1;
            }
            sage: print(D.graphviz_string(rankdir="left"))
            digraph {
              rankdir=RL
              node_0  [label="1"];
              node_1  [label="2"];
            <BLANKLINE>
              node_0 -> node_1;
            }
            sage: print(D.graphviz_string(rankdir="right"))
            digraph {
              rankdir=LR
              node_0  [label="1"];
              node_1  [label="2"];
            <BLANKLINE>
              node_0 -> node_1;
            }

        Edge-specific options can also be specified by providing a function (or
        tuple thereof) which maps each edge to a dictionary of options. Valid
        options are

        - ``"color"``
        - ``"dot"`` (a string containing a sequence of options in ``dot`` format)
        - ``"label"`` (a string)
        - ``"label_style"`` (``"string"`` or ``"latex"``)
        - ``"edge_string"`` (``"--"`` or ``"->"``)
        - ``"dir"`` (``"forward"``, ``"back"``, ``"both"`` or ``"none"``)
        - ``"backward"`` (boolean), instead of defining the edge in the
          graphviz string as ``u -> v`` it draws it as ``v -> u
          [dir=back]`` and instead of ``u -> v [dir=back]`` it draws it as
          ``v -> u``, this changes the way it is drawn by Graphviz's dot
          program: vertex ``v`` will be *above* vertex ``u`` instead of
          below.

        Here we state that the graph should be laid out so that edges
        starting from ``1`` are going backward (e.g. going up instead of
        down)::

            sage: def edge_options(data):
            ....:     u, v, label = data
            ....:     return {"dir":"back"} if u == 1 else {}
            sage: print(G.graphviz_string(edge_options=edge_options))  # random             # optional - sage.symbolic
            digraph {
              node_0  [label="-1"];
              node_1  [label="-1/2"];
              node_2  [label="1/2"];
              node_3  [label="-2"];
              node_4  [label="1/4"];
              node_5  [label="-4"];
              node_6  [label="1/3"];
              node_7  [label="2/3"];
              node_8  [label="4/5"];
              node_9  [label="1"];
              node_10  [label="2"];
            <BLANKLINE>
              node_2 -> node_3;
              node_2 -> node_7;
              node_4 -> node_5;
              node_4 -> node_8;
              node_9 -> node_0 [dir=back];
              node_9 -> node_2 [dir=back];
              node_10 -> node_1;
              node_10 -> node_6;
            }

        We now test all options::

            sage: def edge_options(data):
            ....:     u, v, label = data
            ....:     options = {"color": {f: "red", g: "blue"}[label]}
            ....:     if (u,v) == (1/2, -2): options["label"]       = "coucou"; options["label_style"] = "string"
            ....:     if (u,v) == (1/2,2/3): options["dot"]         = "x=1,y=2"
            ....:     if (u,v) == (1,   -1): options["label_style"] = "latex"
            ....:     if (u,v) == (1,  1/2): options["dir"]         = "back"
            ....:     return options
            sage: print(G.graphviz_string(edge_options=edge_options))  # random             # optional - sage.symbolic
            digraph {

              node_4  [label="1/4"];
              node_5  [label="-4"];
              node_6  [label="1/3"];
              node_7  [label="2/3"];
              node_8  [label="4/5"];
              node_9  [label="1"];
              node_10  [label="2"];
            <BLANKLINE>
              node_2 -> node_3 [label="coucou", color = "red"];
              node_2 -> node_7 [x=1,y=2, color = "blue"];
              node_4 -> node_5 [color = "red"];
              node_4 -> node_8 [color = "blue"];
              node_9 -> node_0 [label=" ", texlbl="$x \ {\mapsto}\ -\frac{1}{x}$", color = "red"];
              node_9 -> node_2 [color = "blue", dir=back];
              node_10 -> node_1 [color = "red"];
              node_10 -> node_6 [color = "blue"];
            }

        We test the possible values of the ``'dir'`` edge option::

            sage: edges = [(0,1,'a'), (1,2,'b'), (2,3,'c'), (3,4,'d')]
            sage: G = DiGraph(edges)
            sage: def edge_options(data):
            ....:     u,v,label = data
            ....:     if label == 'a': return {'dir':'forward'}
            ....:     if label == 'b': return {'dir':'back'}
            ....:     if label == 'c': return {'dir':'none'}
            ....:     if label == 'd': return {'dir':'both'}
            sage: print(G.graphviz_string(edge_options=edge_options))
            digraph {
              node_0  [label="0"];
              node_1  [label="1"];
              node_2  [label="2"];
              node_3  [label="3"];
              node_4  [label="4"];
            <BLANKLINE>
              node_0 -> node_1;
              node_1 -> node_2 [dir=back];

              node_3 -> node_4 [dir=both];
            }

        We test the same graph and ``'dir'`` edge options but with
        ``backward=True``, which reverses the natural direction
        each edge wants to be pointing for the layout::

            sage: def edge_options(data):
            ....:     u,v,label = data
            ....:     if label == 'a': return {'dir':'forward', 'backward':True}
            ....:     if label == 'b': return {'dir':'back', 'backward':True}
            ....:     if label == 'c': return {'dir':'none', 'backward':True}
            ....:     if label == 'd': return {'dir':'both', 'backward':True}
            sage: print(G.graphviz_string(edge_options=edge_options))
            digraph {
              node_0  [label="0"];
              node_1  [label="1"];
              node_2  [label="2"];
              node_3  [label="3"];
              node_4  [label="4"];
            <BLANKLINE>
              node_1 -> node_0 [dir=back];
              node_2 -> node_1;
              node_3 -> node_2 [dir=none];
              node_4 -> node_3 [dir=both];
            }

        TESTS:

        The following digraph has tuples as vertices::

        The following digraph has vertices with newlines in their string

        A digraph may have complex eigenvalues. Previously, the complex parts of

        The Laplacian matrix of a graph is the negative of the adjacency matrix
        with the degree of each vertex on the diagonal.  So for a regular graph,
        if `\delta` is an eigenvalue of a regular graph of degree `r`, then
        `r-\delta` will be an eigenvalue of the Laplacian.  The
        Hoffman-Singleton graph is regular of degree 7, so the following will
        test both the Laplacian construction and the computation of
        eigenvalues. ::

    def relabel(self, perm=None, inplace=True, return_map=False, check_input=True, complete_partial_function=True, immutable=None):
        r"""
        Relabels the vertices of ``self``

        INPUT:

         - ``perm`` -- a function, dictionary, iterable, permutation, or
           ``None`` (default: ``None``)

         - ``inplace`` -- a boolean (default: ``True``)

         - ``return_map`` -- a boolean (default: ``False``)

         - ``check_input`` (boolean) -- whether to test input for
           correctness. *This can potentially be very time-consuming !*.

         - ``complete_partial_function`` (boolean) -- whether to automatically
           complete the permutation if some elements of the graph are not
           associated with any new name. In this case, those elements are not
           relabeled *This can potentially be very time-consuming !*.

         - ``immutable`` (boolean) -- with ``inplace=False``, whether to create
           a mutable/immutable relabelled copy. ``immutable=None`` (default)
           means that the graph and its copy will behave the same way.

        If ``perm`` is a function ``f``, then each vertex ``v`` is
        relabeled to ``f(v)``.

        If ``perm`` is a dictionary ``d``, then each vertex ``v`` (which should
        be a key of ``d``) is relabeled to ``d[v]``.

        If ``perm`` is a list (or more generally, any iterable) of
        length ``n``, then the first vertex returned by ``G.vertices()``
        is relabeled to ``l[0]``, the second to ``l[1]``, ...

        If ``perm`` is a permutation, then each vertex ``v`` is
        relabeled to ``perm(v)``. Caveat: this assumes that the
        vertices are labelled `\{0,1,...,n-1\}`; since permutations
        act by default on the set `\{1,2,...,n\}`, this is achieved by
        identifying `n` and `0`.

        If ``perm`` is ``None``, the graph is relabeled to be on the
        vertices `\{0,1,...,n-1\}`. This is *not* any kind of canonical
        labeling, but it is consistent (relabeling twice will give the
        same result).

        If ``inplace`` is ``True``, the graph is modified in place and
        ``None`` is returned. Otherwise a relabeled copy of the graph
        is returned.

        If ``return_map`` is ``True`` a dictionary representing the
        relabelling map is returned (incompatible with ``inplace==False``).

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(3)
            sage: G.am()
            [0 1 0]
            [1 0 1]
            [0 1 0]

        Relabeling using a dictionary. Note that the dictionary does not define
        the new label of vertex `0`::

            sage: G.relabel({1:2,2:1}, inplace=False).am()
            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 1]
            [1 1 0]

        This is because the method automatically "extends" the relabeling to the
        missing vertices (whose label will not change). Checking that all
        vertices have an image can require some time, and this feature can be
        disabled (at your own risk)::

            sage: G.relabel({1:2,2:1}, inplace=False, complete_partial_function = False).am()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            KeyError: 0

        Relabeling using a list::

            sage: G.relabel([0,2,1], inplace=False).am()
            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 1]
            [1 1 0]

        Relabeling using an iterable::

            sage: G.relabel(iter((0,2,1)), inplace=False).am()
            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 1]
            [1 1 0]

        Relabeling using a Sage permutation::

            sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(3)
            sage: from sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_named import SymmetricGroup
            sage: S = SymmetricGroup(3)
            sage: gamma = S('(1,2)')
            sage: G.relabel(gamma, inplace=False).am()
            [0 0 1]
            [0 0 1]
            [1 1 0]

        A way to get a random relabeling::

            sage: set_random_seed(0)  # Results are reproducible
            sage: D = DiGraph({1: [2], 3: [4]})
            sage: D.relabel(Permutations(D.vertices()).random_element())
            sage: D.sources()
            [1, 4]

        Relabeling using an injective function::

            sage: G.edges()
            [(0, 1, None), (1, 2, None)]
            sage: H = G.relabel(lambda i: i+10, inplace=False)
            sage: H.vertices()
            [10, 11, 12]
            sage: H.edges()
            [(10, 11, None), (11, 12, None)]

        Relabeling using a non injective function has no meaning::

            sage: G.edges()
            [(0, 1, None), (1, 2, None)]
            sage: G.relabel(lambda i: 0, inplace=False)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            NotImplementedError: Non injective relabeling

        But this test can be disabled, which can lead to ... problems::

            sage: G.edges()
            [(0, 1, None), (1, 2, None)]
            sage: G.relabel(lambda i: 0, check_input = False)
            sage: G.edges()
            []

        Recovering the relabeling with ``return_map``::

            sage: G = graphs.CubeGraph(3)
            sage: G.relabel(range(8), return_map=True)
            {'000': 0,
             '001': 1,
             '010': 2,
             '011': 3,
             '100': 4,
             '101': 5,
             '110': 6,
             '111': 7}

        When no permutation is given, the relabeling is done to integers
        from 0 to N-1 but in an arbitrary order::

            sage: G = graphs.CubeGraph(3)
            sage: G.vertices()
            ['000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111']
            sage: G.relabel()
            sage: G.vertices()
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

        In the above case, the mapping is arbitrary but consistent::

            sage: map1 = G.relabel(inplace=False, return_map=True)
            sage: map2 = G.relabel(inplace=False, return_map=True)
            sage: map1 == map2
            True

        ::

            sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(3)
            sage: G.relabel(lambda i: i+10, return_map=True)
            {0: 10, 1: 11, 2: 12}

        TESTS::

            sage: P = Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph())
            sage: P.delete_edge([0,1])
            sage: P.add_edge((4,5))
            sage: P.add_edge((2,6))
            sage: P.delete_vertices([0,1])
            sage: P.relabel()

        The attributes are properly updated too::

            sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(5)
            sage: G.set_vertices({0: 'before', 1: 'delete', 2: 'after'})
            sage: G.delete_vertex(1)
            sage: G.relabel()
            sage: G.get_vertices()
            {0: 'before', 1: 'after', 2: None, 3: None}
            sage: G.get_pos()
            {0: (0, 0), 1: (2, 0), 2: (3, 0), 3: (4, 0)}

        Check that :trac:`12477` is fixed::

            sage: g = Graph({1:[2,3]})
            sage: rel = {1:'a', 2:'b'}
            sage: g.relabel(rel)
            sage: set(g) == {3, 'a', 'b'}

        r"""
        Return the coarsest partition which is finer than the input
        partition, and equitable with respect to self.

        A partition is equitable with respect to a graph if for every pair of
        cells `C_1`, `C_2` of the partition, the number of edges from a vertex
        of `C_1` to `C_2` is the same, over all vertices in `C_1`.

        A partition `P_1` is finer than `P_2` (`P_2` is coarser than `P_1`) if
        every cell of `P_1` is a subset of a cell of `P_2`.

        INPUT:

        -  ``partition`` -- a list of lists

        - ``sparse`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to use sparse or
           dense representation - for small graphs, use dense for speed

        Return the automorphism group of the graph.

        With ``partition`` this can also return the largest subgroup

        partition is finer than the partition given.

        INPUT:

        -  ``partition`` - default is the unit partition,
           otherwise computes the subgroup of the full automorphism group
           respecting the partition.

        -  ``edge_labels`` - default False, otherwise allows
           only permutations respecting edge labels.

           order of the automorphism group

        -  ``return_group`` - default True

        -  ``orbits`` - returns the orbits of the group acting
           on the vertices of the graph

        - ``algorithm`` - If ``algorithm = "bliss"`` the automorphism group is
          computed using the optional package bliss
          (http://www.tcs.tkk.fi/Software/bliss/index.html).  Setting it to

          is used when available.

        OUTPUT: The order of the output is group, order, orbits. However, there
        are options to turn each of these on or off.

            sage: G.automorphism_group(return_group=False, order=True)
            120

        Or, just the orbits (note that each graph here is vertex transitive)

            ....:                            return_group=False, orbits=True,algorithm='sage')

            [['000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111']]

        One can also use the faster algorithm for computing the automorphism
        group of the graph - bliss::

            sage: A1.is_isomorphic(A2)                          # optional - bliss
            True

        TESTS:

            sage: A.is_isomorphic(A_target)
            True

        The labeling is correct::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: ag = g.automorphism_group()
            sage: all(len(ag.orbit(e, action="OnPairs")) == 30
            ....:       for e in g.edge_iterator(labels=False))
            True

        Empty group, correct domain::

            sage: ag = Graph({'a':['a'], 'b':[]}).automorphism_group()
            sage: ag
            Permutation Group with generators [()]
            sage: sorted(ag.domain())

        We can check that the subgroups are labelled correctly

        Test whether the current graph is Hamiltonian.

        A graph (resp. digraph) is said to be Hamiltonian if it contains as a
        subgraph a cycle (resp. a circuit) going through all the vertices.

        Testing for Hamiltonicity being NP-Complete, this algorithm could run
        for some time depending on the instance.

        ALGORITHM:

        See :meth:`~GenericGraph.traveling_salesman_problem`.

        INPUT:

        - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
          Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
          default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
          default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
          <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``constraint_generation`` (boolean) -- whether to use constraint
          generation when solving the Mixed Integer Linear Program.  When
          ``constraint_generation = None``, constraint generation is used
          whenever the graph has a density larger than 70%.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        - ``verbose_constraints`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
          display which constraints are being generated

        - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
          solvers over an inexact base ring; see
          :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

        OUTPUT:

        Returns ``True`` if a Hamiltonian cycle/circuit exists, and ``False``
        otherwise.

        NOTE:

        This function, as ``hamiltonian_cycle`` and
        ``traveling_salesman_problem``, computes a Hamiltonian cycle if it
        exists: the user should *NOT* test for Hamiltonicity using
        ``is_hamiltonian`` before calling ``hamiltonian_cycle`` or
        ``traveling_salesman_problem`` as it would result in computing it twice.

        Return the canonical graph.

        A canonical graph is the representative graph of an isomorphism
        class by some canonization function `c`. If `G` and `H` are graphs,
        then `G \cong c(G)`, and `c(G) == c(H)` if and only if `G \cong H`.

        See the :wikipedia:`Graph_canonization` for more information.

        INPUT:

        - ``partition`` -- if given, the canonical label with respect
          to this set partition will be computed. The default is the unit
          set partition.

        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to
          ``True``, a dictionary mapping from the vertices of the (di)graph
          to its canonical label will also be returned.

        - ``edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``). When set to
          ``True``, allows only permutations respecting edge labels.

        - ``algorithm`` -- a string (default: ``None``). The algorithm to use;
          currently available:

          * ``'bliss'``: use the optional package bliss
            (http://www.tcs.tkk.fi/Software/bliss/index.html);
          * ``'sage'``: always use Sage's implementation.
          * ``None`` (default): use bliss when available and possible

            .. NOTE::

                Make sure you always compare canonical forms obtained by the
                same algorithm.

        - ``return_graph`` -- boolean (default: ``True``). When set to
          ``False``, returns the list of edges of the canonical graph
          instead of the canonical graph; only available when ``'bliss'``
          is explicitly set as algorithm.

        EXAMPLES:

        Canonization changes isomorphism to equality::

            sage: g1 = graphs.GridGraph([2,3])
            sage: g2 = Graph({1: [2, 4], 3: [2, 6], 5: [4, 2, 6]})
            sage: g1 == g2
            False
            sage: g1.is_isomorphic(g2)
            True
            sage: g1.canonical_label() == g2.canonical_label()
            True

        We can get the relabeling used for canonization::

            sage: g, c = g1.canonical_label(algorithm='sage', certificate=True)
            sage: g
            Grid Graph for [2, 3]: Graph on 6 vertices
            sage: c
            {(0, 0): 3, (0, 1): 4, (0, 2): 2, (1, 0): 0, (1, 1): 5, (1, 2): 1}

        Multigraphs and directed graphs work too::

            sage: G = Graph(multiedges=True,sparse=True)
            sage: G.add_edge((0,1))
            sage: G.add_edge((0,1))
            sage: G.add_edge((0,1))
            sage: G.canonical_label()
            Multi-graph on 2 vertices
            sage: Graph('A?').canonical_label()
            Graph on 2 vertices

            sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: DP = P.to_directed()
            sage: DP.canonical_label(algorithm='sage').adjacency_matrix()
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1]
            [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1]
            [0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0]
            [0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
            [0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0]
            [0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0]
            [0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
            [1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0]
            [1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
            [1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]

        Edge labeled graphs::

            sage: G = Graph(sparse=True)
            sage: G.add_edges( [(0,1,'a'),(1,2,'b'),(2,3,'c'),(3,4,'b'),(4,0,'a')] )
            sage: G.canonical_label(edge_labels=True)
            Graph on 5 vertices
            sage: G.canonical_label(edge_labels=True, algorithm="bliss", certificate=True) # optional - bliss
            (Graph on 5 vertices, {0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 2})

            sage: G.canonical_label(edge_labels=True, algorithm="sage", certificate=True)
            (Graph on 5 vertices, {0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 2})

        Another example where different canonization algorithms give
        different graphs::

            sage: g = Graph({'a': ['b'], 'c': ['d']})
            sage: g_sage = g.canonical_label(algorithm='sage')
            sage: g_bliss = g.canonical_label(algorithm='bliss')  # optional - bliss
            sage: g_sage.edges(labels=False)
            [(0, 3), (1, 2)]
            sage: g_bliss.edges(labels=False)  # optional - bliss
            [(0, 1), (2, 3)]

        TESTS::

            sage: G = Graph([['a', 'b'], [('a', 'b')]])
            sage: G.canonical_label(algorithm='sage', certificate=True)
            (Graph on 2 vertices, {'a': 0, 'b': 1})

        Check whether the graph is a Cayley graph.

        If none of the parameters are ``True``, return a boolean indicating
        whether the graph is a Cayley graph. Otherwise, return a tuple
        containing said boolean and the requested data. If the graph is not
        a Cayley graph, each of the data will be ``None``.

        The empty graph is defined to be not a Cayley graph.

        .. NOTE::

            For this routine to work on all graphs, the optional package
            ``gap_packages`` needs to be installed: to do
            so, it is enough to run ``sage -i gap_packages``.

        INPUT:

        - ``return_group`` (boolean; ``False``) -- If True, return a group for
          which the graph is a Cayley graph.

        - ``mapping`` (boolean; ``False``) -- If True, return a mapping from
          vertices to group elements.

        - ``generators`` (boolean; ``False``) -- If True, return the generating
          set of the Cayley graph.

        - ``allow_disconnected`` (boolean; ``False``) -- If True, disconnected
          graphs are considered Cayley if they can be obtained from the Cayley
          construction with a generating set that does not generate the group.

        ALGORITHM:

        For connected graphs, find a regular subgroup of the automorphism
        group. For disconnected graphs, check that the graph is
        vertex-transitive and perform the check on one of its connected
        components. If a simple graph has density over 1/2, perform the check
        on its complement as its disconnectedness may increase performance.

        EXAMPLES:

        A Petersen Graph is not a Cayley graph::

            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.is_cayley()
            False

        A Cayley digraph is a Cayley graph::

            sage: C7 = groups.permutation.Cyclic(7)
            sage: S = [(1,2,3,4,5,6,7), (1,3,5,7,2,4,6), (1,5,2,6,3,7,4)]
            sage: d = C7.cayley_graph(generators=S)
            sage: d.is_cayley()
            True

        Graphs with loops and multiedges will have identity and repeated
        elements, respectively, among the generators::

            sage: g = Graph(graphs.PaleyGraph(9), loops=True, multiedges=True)
            sage: g.add_edges([(u, u) for u in g])
            sage: g.add_edges([(u, u+1) for u in g])
            sage: _, S = g.is_cayley(generators=True)
            sage: S # random
            [(),
             (0,2,1)(a,a + 2,a + 1)(2*a,2*a + 2,2*a + 1),
             (0,2,1)(a,a + 2,a + 1)(2*a,2*a + 2,2*a + 1),
             (0,1,2)(a,a + 1,a + 2)(2*a,2*a + 1,2*a + 2),
             (0,1,2)(a,a + 1,a + 2)(2*a,2*a + 1,2*a + 2),
             (0,2*a + 2,a + 1)(1,2*a,a + 2)(2,2*a + 1,a),
             (0,a + 1,2*a + 2)(1,a + 2,2*a)(2,a,2*a + 1)]

        TESTS:

        Cayley graphs can be reconstructed from the group and generating set::

            sage: g = graphs.PaleyGraph(9)
            sage: _, G, S = g.is_cayley(return_group=True, generators=True)
            sage: Graph(G.cayley_graph(generators=S)).is_isomorphic(g)
            True

        A disconnected graphs may also be a Cayley graph::

            sage: g = graphs.PaleyGraph(9)
            sage: h = g.disjoint_union(g)
            sage: h = h.disjoint_union(h)
            sage: h = h.disjoint_union(g)
            sage: _, G, d, S = h.is_cayley(return_group=True, mapping=True, generators=True, allow_disconnected=True)
            sage: all(set(d[u] for u in h.neighbors(v)) == set(d[v]*x for x in S) for v in h)
            True

        The method also works efficiently with dense simple graphs::

            sage: graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(50, 50).is_cayley()
            True

        Check whether the graph is self-complementary.

        A (di)graph is self-complementary if it is isomorphic to its (di)graph

        are self-complementary.

        Return the Katz matrix of the graph.

        Katz centrality of a node is a measure of centrality in a graph
        network. Katz centrality computes the relative influence of a node
        within a network. Connections made with distant neighbors are, however
        penalized by an attenuation factor `\alpha`.

        Adding the values in the Katz matrix of all columns in a particular row
        gives the Katz centrality measure of the vertex represented by that
        particular row.  Katz centrality measures influence by taking into
        account the total number of walks between a pair of nodes.

        See the :wikipedia:`Katz_centrality` for more information.

        INPUT:

        - ``alpha`` -- a nonnegative real number, must be less than the
          reciprocal of the spectral radius of the graph (the maximum
          absolute eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix)

        - ``nonedgesonly`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, value
          for each edge present in the graph is set to zero.

        - ``vertices`` -- list (default: ``None``); the ordering of the
          vertices defining how they should appear in the matrix. By default,
          the ordering given by :meth:`GenericGraph.vertices` is used.

        OUTPUT: the Katz matrix of the graph with parameter alpha

        EXAMPLES:

        The SEP of a graph with edges on `n` vertices has dimension `n`
        minus the number of connected components::

            sage: n = randint(5, 12)
            sage: G = Graph()
            sage: while not G.num_edges():
            ....:     G = graphs.RandomGNP(n, 0.2)
            sage: P = G.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: P.ambient_dim() == n
            True
            sage: P.dim() == n - G.connected_components_number()
            True

        The SEP of a graph is isomorphic to the subdirect sum of
        its connected components SEP's::

            sage: n = randint(3, 6)
            sage: G1 = graphs.RandomGNP(n, 0.2)
            sage: n = randint(3, 6)
            sage: G2 = graphs.RandomGNP(n, 0.2)
            sage: G = G1.disjoint_union(G2)
            sage: P = G.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: P1 = G1.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: P2 = G2.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: P.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(P1.subdirect_sum(P2))
            True

        All trees on `n` vertices have isomorphic SEPs::

            sage: n = randint(4, 10)
            sage: G1 = graphs.RandomTree(n)
            sage: G2 = graphs.RandomTree(n)
            sage: P1 = G1.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: P2 = G2.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: P1.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(P2)
            True

        However, there are still many different SEPs::

            sage: len(list(graphs(5)))
            34
            sage: polys = []
            sage: for G in graphs(5):
            ....:     P = G.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            ....:     for P1 in polys:
            ....:         if P.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(P1):
            ....:             break
            ....:     else:
            ....:         polys.append(P)
            ....:
            sage: len(polys)
            25

        A non-trivial example of two graphs with isomorphic SEPs::

            sage: G1 = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
            sage: G1.add_edges([[0, 5], [5, 2], [1, 6], [6, 2]])
            sage: G2 = copy(G1)
            sage: G1.add_edges([[2, 7], [7, 3]])
            sage: G2.add_edges([[0, 7], [7, 3]])
            sage: G1.is_isomorphic(G2)
            False
            sage: P1 = G1.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: P2 = G2.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: P1.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(P2)
            True

        Apparently, glueing two graphs together on a vertex
        gives isomorphic SEPs::

            sage: n = randint(3, 7)
            sage: g1 = graphs.RandomGNP(n, 0.2)
            sage: g2 = graphs.RandomGNP(n, 0.2)
            sage: G = g1.disjoint_union(g2)
            sage: H = copy(G)
            sage: G.merge_vertices(((0, randrange(n)), (1, randrange(n))))
            sage: H.merge_vertices(((0, randrange(n)), (1, randrange(n))))
            sage: PG = G.symmetric_edge_polytope()
            sage: PH = H.symmetric_edge_polytope()

    r"""
    Helper function for canonical labeling of edge labeled (di)graphs.

    Translates to a bipartite incidence-structure type graph appropriate for
    computing canonical labels of edge labeled and/or multi-edge graphs.
    Note that this is actually computationally equivalent to implementing a
    change on an inner loop of the main algorithm -- namely making the
    refinement procedure sort for each label.

    If the graph is a multigraph, it is translated to a non-multigraph,
    where each instance of multiple edges is converted to a single
    edge labeled with a list ``[[label1, multiplicity], [label2,
    multiplicity], ...]`` describing how many edges of each label were
    originally there. Then in either case we are working on a graph
    without multiple edges. At this point, we create another
    (partially bipartite) graph, whose left vertices are the original
    vertices of the graph, and whose right vertices represent the
    labeled edges. Any unlabeled edges in the original graph are also
    present in the new graph, and -- this is the bipartite aspect --
    for every labeled edge `e` from `v` to `w` in the original graph,
    there is an edge between the right vertex corresponding to `e` and
    each of the left vertices corresponding to `v` and `w`. We
    partition the left vertices as they were originally, and the right
    vertices by common labels: only automorphisms taking edges to
    like-labeled edges are allowed, and this additional partition
    information enforces this on the new graph.

    INPUT:

    - ``g`` -- Graph or DiGraph

    - ``partition`` -- list (default: ``None``); a partition of the
      vertices as a list of lists of vertices. If given, the partition
      of the vertices is as well relabeled

    - ``standard_label`` -- (default: ``None``); edges in ``g`` with
      this label are preserved in the new graph

    - ``return_relabeling`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether
      to return a dictionary containing the relabeling

    - ``return_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether
      the different ``edge_labels`` are returned (useful if inplace is
      ``True``)

    - ``inplace`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether the input
      (di)graph ``g`` is modified or the return a new (di)graph. Note
      that attributes of ``g`` are *not* copied for speed issues, only
      edges and vertices.

    - ``ignore_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``): if
      ``True``, ignore edge labels, so when constructing the new
      graph, only multiple edges are replaced with vertices. Labels on
      multiple edges are ignored -- only the multiplicity is relevant,
      so multiple edges with the same multiplicity in the original
      graph correspond to right vertices in the same partition in the
      new graph.

    OUTPUT:

    - if ``inplace`` is ``False``: the unlabeled graph without
      multiple edges
    - the partition of the vertices
    - if ``return_relabeling`` is ``True``: a dictionary containing
      the relabeling
    - if ``return_edge_labels`` is ``True``: the list of (former) edge
      labels is returned
