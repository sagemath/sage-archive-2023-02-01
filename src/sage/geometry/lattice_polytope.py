Lattice and reflexive polytopes

This module provides tools for work with lattice and reflexive
polytopes. A *convex polytope* is the convex hull of finitely many
points in `\RR^n`. The dimension `n` of a
polytope is the smallest `n` such that the polytope can be
embedded in `\RR^n`.

A *lattice polytope* is a polytope whose vertices all have integer
coordinates.

If `L` is a lattice polytope, the dual polytope of
`L` is

.. math::

       \{y \in \ZZ^n :   x\cdot y \geq -1 \text{ all } x \in L\}


A *reflexive polytope* is a lattice polytope, such that its polar
is also a lattice polytope, i.e. it is bounded and has vertices with
integer coordinates.

This Sage module uses Package for Analyzing Lattice Polytopes
(PALP), which is a program written in C by Maximilian Kreuzer and
Harald Skarke, which is freely available under the GNU license
terms at http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~kreuzer/CY/. Moreover, PALP is
included standard with Sage.

PALP is described in the paper :arxiv:`math.SC/0204356`. Its distribution
also contains the application nef.x, which was created by Erwin
Riegler and computes nef-partitions and Hodge data for toric
complete intersections.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT: polytope.py module written by William Stein was
used as an example of organizing an interface between an external
program and Sage. William Stein also helped Andrey Novoseltsev with
debugging and tuning of this module.

Robert Bradshaw helped Andrey Novoseltsev to realize plot3d
function.

.. note::

   IMPORTANT: PALP requires some parameters to be determined during
   compilation time, i.e., the maximum dimension of polytopes, the
   maximum number of points, etc. These limitations may lead to errors
   during calls to different functions of these module.  Currently, a
   ValueError exception will be raised if the output of poly.x or
   nef.x is empty or contains the exclamation mark. The error message
   will contain the exact command that caused an error, the
   description and vertices of the polytope, and the obtained output.

Data obtained from PALP and some other data is cached and most
returned values are immutable. In particular, you cannot change the
vertices of the polytope or their order after creation of the
polytope.

If you are going to work with large sets of data, take a look at
``all_*`` functions in this module. They precompute different data
for sequences of polynomials with a few runs of external programs.
This can significantly affect the time of future computations. You
can also use dump/load, but not all data will be stored (currently
only faces and the number of their internal and boundary points are
stored, in addition to polytope vertices and its polar).

def LatticePolytope(data, compute_vertices=True, n=0, lattice=None):
    r"""
    Construct a lattice polytope.

    INPUT:

    - ``data`` -- points spanning the lattice polytope, specified as one of:

        * a :class:`point collection
          <sage.geometry.point_collection.PointCollection>` (this is the
          preferred input and it is the quickest and the most memory efficient
          one);

        * an iterable of iterables (for example, a list of vectors)
          defining the point coordinates;

        * a file with matrix data, opened for reading, or

        * a filename of such a file, see :func:`read_palp_matrix` for the
          file format;

    - ``compute_vertices`` -- boolean (default: ``True``). If ``True``, the
       convex hull of the given points will be computed for
       determining vertices. Otherwise, the given points must be
       vertices;

    - ``n`` -- an integer (default: 0) if ``data`` is a name of a file,
       that contains data blocks for several polytopes, the ``n``-th block
       will be used;

    - ``lattice`` -- the ambient lattice of the polytope. If not given, a
      suitable lattice will be determined automatically, most likely the
      :class:`toric lattice <sage.geometry.toric_lattice.ToricLatticeFactory>`
      `M` of the appropriate dimension.

    OUTPUT:

    - a :class:`lattice polytope <LatticePolytopeClass>`.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: points = [(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (-1,0,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,-1)]
        sage: p = LatticePolytope(points)
        sage: p
        3-d reflexive polytope in 3-d lattice M
        sage: p.vertices()
        M( 1,  0,  0),
        M( 0,  1,  0),
        M( 0,  0,  1),
        M(-1,  0,  0),
        M( 0, -1,  0),
        M( 0,  0, -1)
        in 3-d lattice M

    We draw a pretty picture of the polytope in 3-dimensional space::

        sage: p.plot3d().show()

    Now we add an extra point, which is in the interior of the
    polytope...

    ::

        sage: points.append((0,0,0))
        sage: p = LatticePolytope(points)
        sage: p.nvertices()
        6

    You can suppress vertex computation for speed but this can lead to
    mistakes::

        sage: p = LatticePolytope(points, compute_vertices=False)
        ...
        sage: p.nvertices()
        7

    Given points must be in the lattice::

        sage: LatticePolytope([[1/2], [3/2]])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: points
        [[1/2], [3/2]]
        are not in 1-d lattice M!

    But it is OK to create polytopes of non-maximal dimension::


        sage: p = LatticePolytope([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,0),
        ...         (-1,0,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,0), (0,0,0)])
        sage: p
        2-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
        sage: p.vertices()
        M( 1,  0, 0),
        M( 0,  1, 0),
        M(-1,  0, 0),
        M( 0, -1, 0)
        in 3-d lattice M

    An empty lattice polytope can be considered as well::

        sage: p = LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3).dual()); p
        -1-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
        sage: p.lattice_dim()
        3
        sage: p.npoints()
        0
        sage: p.nfacets()
        0
        sage: p.points()
        Empty collection

        Return the matrix of distances for this polytope or distances for
        the given point.

        The matrix of distances m gives distances m[i,j] between the i-th
        facet (which is also the i-th vertex of the polar polytope in the
        reflexive case) and j-th point of this polytope.

        If point is specified, integral distances from the point to all
        facets of this polytope will be computed.

        This function CAN be used for polytopes whose dimension is smaller
        than the dimension of the ambient space. In this case distances are
        computed in the affine subspace spanned by the polytope and if the
        point is given, it must be in this subspace.

        EXAMPLES:

        Let's take a look at the face lattice of a square::

            sage: square = LatticePolytope([(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)])
            sage: L = square.face_lattice()
            sage: L
            Finite poset containing 10 elements with distinguished linear extension

        To see all faces arranged by dimension, you can do this::

            sage: for level in L.level_sets(): print level
            [-1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M]
            [0-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             0-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             0-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             0-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M]
            [1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M]
            [2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M]

        For a particular face you can look at its actual vertices... ::

            sage: face = L.level_sets()[1][0]
            sage: face.vertices()
            M(0, 0)
            in 2-d lattice M

        ... or you can see the index of the vertex of the original polytope that
        corresponds to the above one::

            sage: face.ambient_vertex_indices()
            (0,)
            sage: square.vertex(0)
            M(0, 0)

        An alternative to extracting faces from the face lattice is to use
        :meth:`faces` method::

            sage: face is square.faces_lp(dim=0)[0]
            True

        The advantage of working with the face lattice directly is that you
        can (relatively easily) get faces that are related to the given one::

            sage: face = L.level_sets()[1][0]
            sage: D = L.hasse_diagram()
            sage: D.neighbors(face)
            [1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             -1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M]

        However, you can achieve some of this functionality using
        :meth:`facets`, :meth:`facet_of`, and :meth:`adjacent` methods::

            sage: face = square.faces_lp(0)[0]
            sage: face
            0-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M
            sage: face.vertices()
            M(0, 0)
            in 2-d lattice M
            sage: face.facets_lp()
            (-1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,)
            sage: face.facet_of()
            (1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             1-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M)
            sage: face.adjacent()
            (0-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M,
             0-d face of 2-d lattice polytope in 2-d lattice M)
            sage: face.adjacent()[0].vertices()
            M(1, 0)
            in 2-d lattice M
    
        Note that if ``p`` is a face of ``superp``, then the face
        lattice of ``p`` consists of (appropriate) faces of ``superp``::

            sage: superp = LatticePolytope([(1,2,3,4), (5,6,7,8),

        Now we omit projections::

            [
            Nef-partition {0, 1, 4, 5} U {2, 3, 6, 7} (direct product),

            Nef-partition {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} U {6, 7}
            ]

        Currently Hodge numbers cannot be computed for a given nef-partition::

            sage: p.nef_partitions()[1].hodge_numbers()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            NotImplementedError: use nef_partitions(hodge_numbers=True)!

        But they can be obtained from ``nef.x`` for all nef-partitions at once.
        Partitions will be exactly the same::

            sage: p.nef_partitions(hodge_numbers=True)  # long time (2s on sage.math, 2011)
            [
            Nef-partition {0, 1, 4, 5} U {2, 3, 6, 7} (direct product),

            Nef-partition {0, 1, 2, 4, 5} U {3, 6, 7},

            Nef-partition {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} U {7} (projection)
            ]

        Now it is possible to get Hodge numbers::

            sage: p.nef_partitions(hodge_numbers=True)[1].hodge_numbers()
            (20,)

        Since nef-partitions are cached, their Hodge numbers are accessible
        after the first request, even if you do not specify
        ``hodge_numbers=True`` anymore::

            sage: p.nef_partitions()[1].hodge_numbers()
            (20,)

        We illustrate removal of symmetric partitions on a diamond::

            sage: p = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(2)
            sage: p.nef_partitions()
            [
            Nef-partition {0, 2} U {1, 3} (direct product),

            Nef-partition {0, 1, 2} U {3} (projection)
            ]
            sage: p.nef_partitions(keep_symmetric=True)
            [
            Nef-partition {0, 1, 3} U {2} (projection),
            Nef-partition {0, 2, 3} U {1} (projection),
            Nef-partition {0, 3} U {1, 2},
            Nef-partition {1, 2, 3} U {0} (projection),
            Nef-partition {1, 3} U {0, 2} (direct product),
            Nef-partition {2, 3} U {0, 1},
            Nef-partition {0, 1, 2} U {3} (projection)

        Two full-dimensional lattice polytopes are in the same
        ``GL(\mathbb{Z})``-orbit if and only if their normal forms are the
        same. Normal form is not defined and thus cannot be used for polytopes
        whose dimension is smaller than the dimension of the ambient space.

        The original algorithm was presented in [KS98]_ and implemented
        in PALP. A modified version of the PALP algorithm is discussed in
        [GK13]_ and available here as "palp_modified".

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- (default: "palp") The algorithm which is used
          to compute the normal form. Options are:

          * "palp" -- Run external PALP code, usually the fastest option.

          * "palp_native" -- The original PALP algorithm implemented
            in sage. Currently considerably slower than PALP.

          * "palp_modified" -- A modified version of the PALP
            algorithm which determines the maximal vertex-facet
            pairing matrix first and then computes its
            automorphisms, while the PALP algorithm does both things
            concurrently.

        - ``permutation`` -- (default: ``False``) If ``True`` the permutation
          applied to vertices to obtain the normal form is returned as well.
          Note that the different algorithms may return different results
          that nevertheless lead to the same normal form.

        OUTPUT:

        - a :class:`point collection <PointCollection>` in the :meth:`lattice`
          of ``self`` or a tuple of it and a permutation.

        We compute the normal form of the "diamond"::

            M(-1,  0)

            2-d reflexive polytope #3 in 2-d lattice M
            
        You can get it in its normal form (in the default lattice) as ::
        
            sage: lattice_polytope.ReflexivePolytope(2, 3).vertices()

        It is not possible to compute normal forms for polytopes which do not
        span the space::

        By default, everything is shown with more or less pretty

        INPUT: Most of the parameters are self-explanatory:

        -  ``facet_color`` - (default:(0,1,0))

        -  ``facet_colors`` - (default:None) if specified, must be a list of
           colors for each facet separately, used instead of ``facet_color``

        -  ``show_edges`` - (default:True) whether to draw
           edges as lines

        -  ``edge_thickness`` - (default:3)

        -  ``edge_color`` - (default:(0.5,0.5,0.5))

        -  ``show_vertices`` - (default:True) whether to draw
           vertices as balls

        -  ``vertex_size`` - (default:10)

        -  ``vertex_color`` - (default:(1,0,0))

        -  ``vindex_color`` - (default:(0,0,0)) color for
           vertex labels

        -  ``vlabels`` - (default:None) if specified, must be a list of labels
           for each vertex, default labels are vertex indicies

        -  ``show_pindices`` - (default:same as show_points)
           whether to show indices of other points

        -  ``pindex_color`` - (default:(0,0,0)) color for
           point labels

        -  ``index_shift`` - (default:1.1)) if 1, labels are
           placed exactly at the corresponding points. Otherwise the label
           position is computed as a multiple of the point position vector.

    OUTPUT:

    - a nef-partition of ``Delta_polar``.

    Let $M$ and $N$ be dual lattices. Let $\Delta \subset M_\RR$ be a reflexive
    polytope with polar $\Delta^\circ \subset N_\RR$. Let $X_\Delta$ be the
    toric variety associated to the normal fan of $\Delta$. A **nef-partition**
    is a decomposition of the vertex set $V$ of $\Delta^\circ$ into a disjoint
    union $V = V_0 \sqcup V_1 \sqcup \dots \sqcup V_{k-1}$ such that divisors
    $E_i = \sum_{v\in V_i} D_v$ are Cartier (here $D_v$ are prime
    torus-invariant Weil divisors corresponding to vertices of $\Delta^\circ$).
    Equivalently, let $\nabla_i \subset N_\RR$ be the convex hull of vertices
    from $V_i$ and the origin. These polytopes form a nef-partition if their
    Minkowski sum $\nabla \subset N_\RR$ is a reflexive polytope.

    The **dual nef-partition** is formed by polytopes $\Delta_i \subset M_\RR$
    of $E_i$, which give a decomposition of the vertex set of $\nabla^\circ
    \subset M_\RR$ and their Minkowski sum is $\Delta$, i.e. the polar duality
    of reflexive polytopes switches convex hull and Minkowski sum for dual
    nef-partitions:

    .. MATH::

        \Delta^\circ
        &=
        \mathrm{Conv} \left(\nabla_0, \nabla_1, \dots, \nabla_{k-1}\right), \\
        \nabla^{\phantom{\circ}}
        &=
        \nabla_0 + \nabla_1 + \dots + \nabla_{k-1}, \\
        &
        \\
        \Delta^{\phantom{\circ}}
        &=
        \Delta_0 + \Delta_1 + \dots + \Delta_{k-1}, \\
        \nabla^\circ
        &=
        \mathrm{Conv} \left(\Delta_0, \Delta_1, \dots, \Delta_{k-1}\right).

    EXAMPLES:

    It is very easy to create a nef-partition for the octahedron, since for
    this polytope any decomposition of vertices is a nef-partition. We create a
    3-part nef-partition with the 0-th and 1-st vertices belonging to the 0-th
    part (recall that numeration in Sage starts with 0), the 2-nd and 5-th
    vertices belonging to the 1-st part, and 3-rd and 4-th vertices belonging
    to the 2-nd part::

        sage: o = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3)
        sage: np = NefPartition([0,0,1,2,2,1], o)
        sage: np
        Nef-partition {0, 1} U {2, 5} U {3, 4}

    The octahedron plays the role of `\Delta^\circ` in the above description::

        sage: np.Delta_polar() is o
        True

    The dual nef-partition (corresponding to the "mirror complete
    intersection") gives decomposition of the vertex set of `\nabla^\circ`::

        sage: np.dual()
        Nef-partition {4, 5, 6} U {1, 3} U {0, 2, 7}
        sage: np.nabla_polar().vertices()
        N( 1,  1,  0),
        N( 0,  0,  1),
        N( 0,  1,  0),
        N( 0,  0, -1),
        N(-1, -1,  0),
        N( 0, -1,  0),
        N(-1,  0,  0),
        N( 1,  0,  0)
        in 3-d lattice N

    Of course, `\nabla^\circ` is `\Delta^\circ` from the point of view of the
    dual nef-partition::

        sage: np.dual().Delta_polar() is np.nabla_polar()
        True
        sage: np.Delta(1).vertices()
        N(0, 0,  1),
        N(0, 0, -1)
        in 3-d lattice N
        sage: np.dual().nabla(1).vertices()
        N(0, 0,  1),
        N(0, 0, -1)
        in 3-d lattice N

    Instead of constructing nef-partitions directly, you can request all 2-part
    nef-partitions of a given reflexive polytope (they will be computed using
    ``nef.x`` program from PALP)::

        sage: o.nef_partitions()

    it only supports permutations of up to 62 objects and labels these by
    `0 \dots 9`, `a \dots z`, and `A \dots Z`.

    INPUT:

    - ``permutation`` -- A string specifying a PALP style permutation.

def read_palp_matrix(data, permutation=False):
    r"""
    Read and return an integer matrix from a string or an opened file.

    First input line must start with two integers m and n, the number
    of rows and columns of the matrix. The rest of the first line is
    ignored. The next m lines must contain n numbers each.

    If m>n, returns the transposed matrix. If the string is empty or EOF
    is reached, returns the empty matrix, constructed by
    ``matrix()``.

    INPUT:

    - ``data`` -- Either a string containing the filename or the file itself
                  containing the output by PALP.

    - ``permutation`` -- (default: ``False``) If ``True``, try to retrieve
      the permutation output by PALP. This parameter makes sense only
      when PALP computed the normal form of a lattice polytope.

    OUTPUT:

    A matrix or a tuple of a matrix and a permutation.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: lattice_polytope.read_palp_matrix("2 3 comment \n 1 2 3 \n 4 5 6")

def set_palp_dimension(d):
    r"""
    Set the dimension for PALP calls to ``d``.

    INPUT:

    - ``d`` -- an integer from the list [4,5,6,11] or ``None``.

    OUTPUT:

    - none.

    PALP has many hard-coded limits, which must be specified before
    compilation, one of them is dimension. Sage includes several versions with
    different dimension settings (which may also affect other limits and enable
    certain features of PALP). You can change the version which will be used by
    calling this function. Such a change is not done automatically for each
    polytope based on its dimension, since depending on what you are doing it
    may be necessary to use dimensions higher than that of the input polytope.

    EXAMPLES:

    By default, it is not possible to create the 7-dimensional simplex with
    vertices at the basis of the 8-dimensional space::

        sage: LatticePolytope(identity_matrix(8))
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Error executing 'poly.x -fv' for the given polytope!
        Output:
        Please increase POLY_Dmax to at least 7

    However, we can work with this polytope by changing PALP dimension to 11::

        sage: lattice_polytope.set_palp_dimension(11)
        sage: LatticePolytope(identity_matrix(8))
        7-d lattice polytope in 8-d lattice M

    Let's go back to default settings::

        sage: lattice_polytope.set_palp_dimension(None)
    """
    global _palp_dimension
    _palp_dimension = d


def skip_palp_matrix(data, n=1):
    r"""
    Skip matrix data in a file.

    INPUT:


    -  ``data`` - opened file with blocks of matrix data in
       the following format: A block consisting of m+1 lines has the
       number m as the first element of its first line.

    -  ``n`` - (default: 1) integer, specifies how many
       blocks should be skipped
