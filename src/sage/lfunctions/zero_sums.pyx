            optimized for elliptic curve `L`-functions, and tau must be 0. self
            must be attached to an elliptic curve over `\QQ` given by its global
            minimal model, otherwise the returned result will be incorrect.

          - ``sincquared_parallel`` -- Same as "sincsquared_fast", but optimized
            for parallel computation with large (>2.0) `\Delta` values. self must
            be attached to an elliptic curve over `\QQ` given by its global minimal
            model, otherwise the returned result will be incorrect.

          - ``cauchy`` -- `f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}`; this is only computable to
            low precision, and only when `\Delta < 2`.

        - ``ncpus`` - (default: None) If not None, a positive integer
          defining the number of CPUs to be used for the computation. If left as
          None, the maximum available number of CPUs will be used.
          Only implemented for algorithm="sincsquared_parallel"; ignored
          otherwise.

        .. WARNING::

            Computation time is exponential in `\Delta`, roughly doubling for
            every increase of 0.1 thereof. Using `\Delta=1` will yield a
            computation time of a few milliseconds; `\Delta=2` takes a few
            seconds, and `\Delta=3` takes upwards of an hour. Increase at your
            own risk beyond this!

        OUTPUT:

        A positive real number that bounds from above the number of zeros with
        imaginary part equal to `\tau`. When `\tau=0` this is an upper bound for
        the `L`-function's analytic rank.

        Return an upper bound for the analytic rank of the L-function
        `L_E(s)` attached to self, conditional on the Generalized Riemann
        Hypothesis, via computing the zero sum `\sum_{\gamma} f(\Delta\gamma)`,
        where `\gamma` ranges over the imaginary parts of the zeros of `L(E,s)`
        along the critical strip, `f(x) = \left(\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}\right)^2`,
        and `\Delta` is the tightness parameter whose maximum value is
        specified by max_Delta. This computation can be run on curves with
        very large conductor (so long as the conductor is known or quickly
        computable) when Delta is not too large (see below).

        Uses Bober's rank bounding method as described in [Bob-13]_.

        INPUT:

        - ``max_Delta`` -- (default: None) If not None, a positive real value
          specifying the maximum Delta value used in the zero sum; larger
          values of Delta yield better bounds - but runtime is exponential in
          Delta. If left as None, Delta is set
          to `\min\left\{\frac{1}{\pi}\left(\log(N+1000)/2-\log(2\pi)-\eta\right), 2.5\right\}`,
          where `N` is the conductor of the curve attached to self, and `\eta`
          is the Euler-Mascheroni constant `= 0.5772...`; the crossover
          point is at conductor ~8.3*10^8. For the former value, empirical
          results show that for about 99.7% of all curves the returned value
          is the actual analytic rank.

        - ``adaptive`` -- (default: True) Boolean

          - If True, the computation is first run with small and then
            successively larger Delta values up to max_Delta. If at any
            point the computed bound is 0 (or 1 when when root_number is -1
            or True), the computation halts and that value is returned;
            otherwise the minimum of the computed bounds is returned.
          - If False, the computation is run a single time with
            Delta=max_Delta, and the resulting bound returned.

        - ``root_number`` -- (default: "compute") String or integer

          - ``"compute"`` -- the root number of self is computed and used to
            (possibly) lower ther analytic rank estimate by 1.
          - ``"ignore"`` -- the above step is omitted
          - ``1`` -- this value is assumed to be the root number of
            self. This is passable so that rank estimation can be done for
            curves whose root number has been precomputed.
          - ``-1`` -- this value is assumed to be the root number of
            self. This is passable so that rank estimation can be done for
            curves whose root number has been precomputed.

        - ``bad_primes`` -- (default: None) If not None, a list of the primes
          of bad reduction for the curve attached to self. This is passable
          so that rank estimation can be done for curves of large conductor
          whose bad primes have been precomputed.

        - ``ncpus`` -- (default: None) If not None, a positive integer
          defining the maximum number of CPUs to be used for the computation.
          If left as None, the maximum available number of CPUs will be used.
          Note: Multiple processors will only be used for Delta values >= 1.75.

        .. NOTE::

            Output will be incorrect if the incorrect root number is specified.

        .. WARNING::

            Zero sum computation time is exponential in the tightness parameter
            `\Delta`, roughly doubling for every increase of 0.1 thereof.
            Using `\Delta=1` (and adaptive=False) will yield a runtime of a few
            milliseconds; `\Delta=2` takes a few seconds, and `\Delta=3` may
            take upwards of an hour. Increase beyond this at your own risk!

        OUTPUT:

        A non-negative integer greater than or equal to the analytic rank of
        self. If the returned value is 0 or 1 (the latter if parity is not
        False), then this is the true analytic rank of self.

        .. NOTE::

            If you use set_verbose(1), extra information about the computation
            will be printed.

        EXAMPLES:

        For most elliptic curves with small conductor the central zero(s)
        of `L_E(s)` are fairly isolated, so small values of `\Delta`
        will yield tight rank estimates.

        However, some curves have `L`-functions with low-lying zeroes, and for these
        larger values of `\Delta` must be used to get tight estimates.

        to get tight bounds, thus speeding up runtime considerably.

        The are a small number of curves which have pathologically low-lying
        zeroes. For these curves, this method will produce a bound that is
        strictly larger than the analytic rank, unless very large values of
        Delta are used. The following curve ("256944c1" in the Cremona tables)
        is a rank 0 curve with a zero at 0.0256...; the smallest Delta value
        for which the zero sum is strictly less than 2 is ~2.815.

            sage: E.analytic_rank_upper_bound(max_Delta=2,adaptive=False)

        And it can bound rank on curves with *very* large conductor, so long as
        you know beforehand/can easily compute the conductor and primes of bad
        reduction less than `e^{2\pi\Delta}`. The example below is of the rank
