== Description ==

GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular
emphasis on Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming
language, a library of thousands of functions implementing algebraic
algorithms written in the GAP language as well as large data libraries
of algebraic objects. See also the overview and the description of the
mathematical capabilities. GAP is used in research and teaching for
studying groups and their representations, rings, vector spaces,
algebras, combinatorial structures, and more. The system, including
source, is distributed freely. You can study and easily modify or
extend it for your special use.

This is a stripped-down version of GAP.  The databases, which are
architecture-independent, are in a separate package.

 * William Stein
 * Robert Miller
 * David Joyner
 * Dmitrii Pasechnik
 * Martin Albrecht
 * Volker Braun

== Upstream Contact ==

David Joyner, wdjoyner@gmail.com (on the GAP team, but
Steve Linton, sal@dcs.st-and.ac.uk, is basically the lead developer)

== Dependencies ==

 * Readline
 * MPIR

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

This is a stripped-down version of GAP. The downloading of the sources
and removal of unneeded parts is done by the script spkg-src. When you
update GAP, please also update and use the spkg-src script.

 * Do we really want to copy everything from the build directory???
   You need the full GAP tree to compile/install many GAP packages.

 * There's apparently a command missing (in `spkg-install`) building the
   (HTML?) documentation.  Earlier changelog entries as well as the description
   above state the documentation was removed from the upstream sources...
   Since the (pre-)built HTML documentation is currently included, I've
   commented out some lines in that part of `spkg-install`. -leif

=== gap-4.6.3.p0 (Jeroen Demeyer, Volker Braun, 25 April 2013) ===
 * #14039: Upgrade to version 4.6.3.
 * Use standard spkg-install boilerplate.
 * Remove all unneeded "cd" statements from spkg-install.

 * Cleanup old Cygwin fixes now unnecessary.

=== gap-4.5.7.p2 (Jeroen Demeyer, 17 January 2013) ===
 * #13963: do not touch gap_stamp (which isn't used anyway).
 * Use -O2 -g as default CFLAGS and never override user-set flags.
 * Remove unsetting of CC and CXX which doesn't seem to be needed
   anymore.
 * Use autoconf tracing to determine the GAP version number.

=== gap-4.5.7.p1 (Volker Braun, 20 December 2012) ===
 * #13211: Fix gap/latest symlink creation.

=== gap-4.5.7.p0 (Jeroen Demeyer, 20 December 2012) ===
 * #13211: update to version 4.5.7.
 * Add spkg-src script to download and clean up the src files.
 * writeandcheck.patch: fix infinite loop in writeandcheck() when
   writing an error message fails.
 * cflags.patch: allow user-supplied CFLAGS to override
   configure-guessed flags.
 * siginterrupt.patch: make interrupt behaviour portable: an interrupt
   while reading stdin shouldn't cause GAP to exit (it does cause an
   error in the next command, which is a different bug).

=== gap-4.5.6 (Volker Braun, 22 September 2012) ===
 * #13211: Update to latest upstream version

=== gap-4.5.5 (Volker Braun, 26 August 2012) ===
 * Update to latest upstream version
 * New (saner) filesystem layout, everything goes to
   "$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/gap-x.y.z" with a "latest" symlink.
 * Added spkg-check

=== gap-4.4.12.p8 (Jean-Pierre Flori, Leif Leonhardy, 5 August 2012) ===
 * #13341: Only create symbolic link to gap.exe on Cygwin if needed.

=== gap-4.4.12.p7 (Leif Leonhardy, March 22nd 2012) ===
 * #7041: Only unset `CC` and `CXX` if really necessary (i.e., if they
   contain spaces, which is what currently would break the build).
 * Clean up `spkg-install`.  Some things seem still weird, see comments.
 * Added "Special Update/Build Instructions" section above.

=== gap-4.4.12.p6 (Jeroen Demeyer, 8 August 2011) ===
 * Trac #11661: Make all files world-readable
 * Remove obsolete dist directory and spkg-debian script

=== gap-4.4.12.p5 (Jason Grout, 22 Feb 2011) ===
 * #10825: Add SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS support to build and install docs in
   $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/

=== gap-4.4.12.p4 (David Kirkby, 14th June 2010) ===
 * #9098 "gap buillds 32-bit on OpenSolaris when SAGE64=yes"
   Change spkg-install to allow gap to build 64-bit on Solaris.
   The changes are only for Solaris, since there are numerous
   warnings that setting CC causes problems. Note, this will not
   built 64-bit on OS X by setting the SAGE64 variable to "yes".

=== gap-4.4.12.p3 (Willem Jan Palenstijn, 2010-4-28) ===

 * Remove some files in src/tst which seemed to have been copied from src/

=== gap-4.4.12.p2 (Dima Pasechnik, 2010-4-27) ===
 * removed everything in src/bin/ (Windows/Cygwin-less related stuff,
   i.e. not needed if full-blown Cygwin is used),
   and GAP 4 PPC (a MacOS 9 executable) in src/

=== gap-4.4.12.p1 (Dima Pasechnik, 2010-1-25) ===
 * See ticket #8076 for full details.
 * Added .hgignore.
 * Applied Steve Linton's Itanium patch to GAP_ROOT/src/saveload.c
   (not using the usual patches/* procedure, as this is
   an upstream patch.)
 *  Removed a stray binary file "patch" at the top level.
 *  Replaced $LN, $MKDIR, etc as done in gap-4.4.10.p13 (see below)

=== gap-4.4.12.p0 (David Joyner, 2009-6-17) ===
 * Upgraded to gap-4.4.12. Removed guava compilation. From the source
   GAP tarball, removed tomlib, small, prim, trans.

=== gap-4.4.10.p13 (David Kirkby, January 8th, 2010) ===
 * #7873 Remove references to $LN, $MKIDR and $RM and replace
   with ln, mkdir and rm, as agreed at
   http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/bd7ae07a1157be
ad/970aa0dc8fa56ab7?lnk=raot

=== gap-4.4.10.p12 (William Stein, June 2, 2009) ===
 * Turn optimization back off for itanium, using exactly the same code as from
   before to do this.

=== gap-4.4.10.p11 (Michael Abshoff, September 20th, 2008) ===
 * Delete all old GAP installs due to a downgrade from GAP 4.4.12 (#5697)

=== gap-4.4.10.p10 (Michael Abshoff, September 20th, 2008) ===

=== gap-4.4.10.p9 (William Stein, August 27th, 2008) ===
 * Apply all the itanium patches to the src/ directory.
   These are from http://www.gap-system.org/Faq/Hardware-OS/hardware-os8.html
   and will be in *all* future versions of Gap (i.e., they come
   from upstream).  They change about 10 files, so I didn't not
   use our usual patches/* and copy protocol.

=== gap-4.4.10.p8 (Michael Abshoff, June 16th, 2008) ===
 * unset CC in spkg-install (work around for #2575)

=== gap-4.4.10.p6 (David Joyner, April 11th, 2008) ===

 * Leon's code is now fully compiled and copied over to $SAGE_LOCAL

=== gap-4.4.10.p3 (David Joyner, March 30th, 2008) ===

 * remove 1500 crap files from the spkg (part of #1883)

=== gap-4.4.10.p0 ===

Upgraded to gap-4.4.10.  Had to change files in the patches directory that
hard code gap-4.4.9.
