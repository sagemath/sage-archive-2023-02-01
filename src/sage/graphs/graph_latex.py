LaTeX options for graphs

This module provides a class to hold, manipulate and employ various
options for rendering a graph in LaTeX, in addition to providing
the code that actually generates a LaTeX representation
of a (combinatorial) graph.

LaTeX Versions of Graphs
-------------------------------------

Many mathematical objects in Sage have LaTeX representations, and graphs are no exception.  For a graph ``g``, the command ``view(g)``, issued at the Sage command line or in the notebook, will create a graphic version of ``g``.  Similarly, ``latex(g)`` will return a (long) string that is a representation of the graph in LaTeX.  Other ways of employing LaTeX in Sage, such as ``%latex`` in a notebook cell, or the Typeset checkbox in the notebook, will handle ``g`` appropriately.

Support through the ``tkz-graph`` package is by Alain Matthes, the author of ``tkz-graph``, whose work can be found at his `Altermundus.com <http://altermundus.com/>`_ site.

The range of possible options for customizing the appearance of a graph are carefully documented at :meth:`sage.graphs.graph_latex.GraphLatex.set_option`.  As a broad overview, the following options are supported:

    - Pre-built Styles:  the pre-built styles of the tkz-graph package provide nice drawings quickly
    - Dimensions: can be specified in natural units, then uniformly scaled after design work
    - Vertex Colors: the perimeter and fill color for vertices can be specified, including on a per-vertex basis
    - Vertex Shapes: may be circles, shaded spheres, rectangles or diamonds, including on a per-vertex basis
    - Vertex Sizes: may be specified as minimums, and will automatically sized to contain vertex labels, including on a per-vertex basis
    - Vertex Labels: can use latex formatting, and may have their colors specified, including on a per-vertex basis
    - Vertex Label Placement: can be interior to the vertex, or external at a configurable location
    - Edge Colors: a solid color with or without a second color down the middle, on a per-edge basis
    - Edge Thickness: can be set, including on a per-edge basis
    - Edge Labels: can use latex formatting, and may have their colors specified, including on a per-edge basis
    - Edge Label Placement: can be to the left, right, above, below, inline, and then sloped or horizontal
    - Digraph Edges: are slightly curved, with arrowheads
    - Loops: may be specified by their size, and with a direction equaling one of the four compass points

To use LaTeX in Sage you of course need a working TeX installation and it will work best if you have the ``dvipng`` and ``convert`` utilities.  For graphs you need the ``tkz-graph.sty`` and ``tkz-berge.sty`` style files of the  tkz-graph package.  TeX, dvipng, and convert should be widely available through package managers or installers.  You may need to install the tkz-graph style files in the appropriate locations, a task beyond the scope of this introduction.  Primary locations for these programs are:

- TeX: http://ctan.org/
- dvipng: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/
- convert: http://www.imagemagick.org (the ImageMagick suite)
- tkz-graph: http://altermundus.com/pages/tkz/

Customizing the output is accomplished in several ways.  Suppose ``g`` is a graph, then ``g.set_latex_options()`` can be used to efficiently set or modify various options.  Setting individual options, or querying options, can be accomplished by first using a command like ``opts = g.latex_options()`` to obtain a :class:`sage.graphs.graph_latex.GraphLatex` object which has several methods to set and retrieve options.

Here is a minimal session demonstrating how to use these features. The following setup should work in the notebook or at the command-line. ::

    sage: H = graphs.HeawoodGraph()
    sage: H.set_latex_options(
    ...   graphic_size=(5,5),
    ...   vertex_size=0.2,
    ...   edge_thickness=0.04,
    ...   edge_color='green',
    ...   vertex_color='green',
    ...   vertex_label_color='red'
    ...   )

At this point, ``view(H)`` should call ``pdflatex`` to process the string created by ``latex(H)`` and then display the resulting graphic.

To use this image in a LaTeX document, you could of course just copy and save the resulting graphic.  However, the ``latex()`` command will produce the underlying LaTeX code, which can be incorporated into a standalone LaTeX document.  ::

EXAMPLES:

This example illustrates switching between the built-in styles when using the tkz_graph format.  ::

    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: g.set_latex_options(tkz_style = 'Classic')
    sage: from sage.graphs.graph_latex import check_tkz_graph
    sage: check_tkz_graph()  # random - depends on TeX installation
    sage: latex(g)
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    ...
    \GraphInit[vstyle=Classic]
    ...
    \end{tikzpicture}
    sage: opts = g.latex_options()
    sage: opts
    LaTeX options for Petersen graph: {'tkz_style': 'Classic'}
    sage: g.set_latex_options(tkz_style = 'Art')
    sage: opts.get_option('tkz_style')
    'Art'
    sage: opts
    LaTeX options for Petersen graph: {'tkz_style': 'Art'}
    sage: latex(g)
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    ...
    \GraphInit[vstyle=Art]
    ...
    \end{tikzpicture}

This example illustrates using the optional dot2tex module::

    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: g.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex',prog='neato') # optional - dot2tex
    sage: from sage.graphs.graph_latex import check_tkz_graph
    sage: check_tkz_graph()  # random - depends on TeX installation
    sage: latex(g)  # optional - dot2tex graphviz
    \begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,line join=bevel,]
    ...
    \end{tikzpicture}

Among other things, this supports the flexible ``edge_options`` option
(see :meth:`sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.graphviz_string`);
here we color in red all edges touching the vertex ``0``::

    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: g.set_latex_options(format="dot2tex", edge_options = lambda (u,v,label): {"color": "red"} if u==0 else {})
    sage: latex(g)  # optional - dot2tex graphviz
    \begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,line join=bevel,]
    ...
    \end{tikzpicture}


TEST:

This graph will look horrible, but it illustrates (and tests) a
great variety of the possible options available through Sage's
interface to the ``tkz-graph`` package.  So it is worth viewing
this in the notebook to see the effects of various defaults and
choices. ::

    def set_option(self, option_name, option_value = None):
        r"""
        Sets, modifies, clears a LaTeX
        option for controlling the rendering of a graph.

        The possible options are documented here, because ultimately it is this
        routine that sets the values.  However, the
        :meth:`sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.set_latex_options` method
        is the easiest way to set options, and allows several to be set at once.

        INPUT:

        - ``option_name`` - a string for a latex option contained in the list
          ``sage.graphs.graph_latex.GraphLatex.__graphlatex_options``. A
          ``ValueError`` is raised if the option is not allowed.

        - ``option_value`` - a value for the option.  If omitted, or
          set to ``None``, the option will use the default value.

        The output can be either handled internally by ``Sage``, or
        delegated to the external software ``dot2tex`` and
        ``graphviz``. This is controlled by the option 'format':

        - ``format`` -- default: 'tkz_graph' -- either 'dot2tex'
          or 'tkz_graph'.

        If format is 'dot2tex', then all the LaTeX generation
        will be delegated to ``dot2tex`` (which must be installed).

        For ``tkz_graph``, the possible option names, and associated
        values are given below.  This first group allows you to set a
        style for a graph and specify some sizes related to the eventual
        image. (For more information consult the
        documentation for the ``tkz-graph`` package.)

        - ``tkz_style`` -- default: 'Custom' -- the name of a pre-defined
          ``tkz-graph`` style such as 'Shade', 'Art', 'Normal', 'Dijkstra',
          'Welsh', 'Classic', and 'Simple', or the string 'Custom'.  Using
          one of these styles alone will often give a reasonably good
          drawing with minimal effort. For a custom appearance set this
          to 'Custom' and use the options described below to override
          the default values.

        - ``units`` -- default: 'cm' -- a natural unit of measurement
          used for all dimensions.  Possible values are:
          'in','mm','cm','pt', 'em', 'ex'

        - ``scale`` -- default: '1.0' -- a dimensionless number that
          multiplies every linear dimension.  So you can design at sizes
          you are accustomed to, then shrink or expand to meet other needs.
          Though fonts do not scale.

        - ``graphic_size`` -- default: (5,5) -- overall dimensions
          (width, length) of the bounding box around the entire graphic image

        - ``margins`` -- default: (0,0,0,0) -- portion of graphic given
          over to a plain border as a tuple of four numbers:
          (left, right, top, bottom).  These are subtracted from the
          ``graphic_size`` to create the area left for the vertices
          of the graph itself.  Note that the processing done by
          Sage will trim the graphic down to the minimum
          possible size, removing any border.  So this is only useful
          if you use the latex string in a latex document.


        If not using a pre-built style the following options are used, so
        the following defaults will apply.  It is not possible to begin with
        a pre-built style and modify it (other than editing the latex
        string by hand after the fact).

        - ``vertex_color`` -- default: 'black' -- a single color
          to use as the default for outline of vertices. For the
          ``sphere`` shape this color is used for the entire vertex,
          which is drawn with a 3D shading.  Colors must be specified
          as a string recognized by the matplotlib library:
          a standard color name like 'red', or a hex string like
          '#2D87A7', or a single character from the choices
          'rgbcmykw'. Additionally, a number between 0 and 1
          will create a grayscale value.  These color specifications
          are consistent throughout the options for a ``tkzpicture``.

        - ``vertex_colors`` -- a dictionary whose keys are vertices
          of the graph and whose values are colors.  These will be used
          to color the outline of vertices.  See the explanation
          above for the ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.
          These values need only be specified for a proper subset of the
          vertices.  Specified values will supersede a default value.

        - ``vertex_fill_color`` -- default: 'white' -- a single color
          to use as the default for the fill color of vertices.  See
          the explanation above for the ``vertex_color`` option
          to see possible values.  This color is ignored for the
          ``sphere`` vertex shape.

        - ``vertex__fill_colors`` -- a dictionary whose keys are vertices
          of the graph and whose values are colors.  These will be used
          to fill the interior of vertices.  See the explanation
          above for the ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.
          These values need only be specified for a proper subset of the
          vertices.  Specified values will supersede a default value.

        - ``vertex_shape`` -- default: 'circle' -- a string for
          the shape of the vertices. Allowable values are 'circle',
          'sphere', 'rectangle', 'diamond'. The sphere shape has
          a 3D look to its coloring and is uses only one color,
          that specified by ``vertex_color`` and ``vertex_colors``,
          which are normally used for the outline of the vertex.

        - ``vertex_shapes`` -- a dictionary whose keys are vertices
          of the graph and whose values are shapes.  See ``vertex_shape``
          for the allowable possibilities.

        - ``vertex_size``-- default: 1.0 -- the minimum size of a vertex
          as a number.  Vertices will expand to contain their labels if
          the labels are placed inside the vertices.  If you set this
          value to zero the vertex will be as small as possible
          (up to tkz-graph's "inner sep" parameter), while still
          containing labels.  However, if labels are not of a uniform
          size, then the verrices will not be either.

        - ``vertex_sizes`` -- a dictionary of sizes for some of the vertices.

        - ``vertex_labels`` -- default: ``True`` -- a boolean to
          determine whether or not to display the vertex labels.
          If ``False`` subsequent options about vertex labels are ignored.

        - ``vertex_labels_math`` -- default: ``True`` -- when true, if a label
          is a string that begins and ends with dollar signs, then the string
          will be rendered as a latex string.  Otherwise, the label will be
          automatically subjected to the ``latex()`` method and rendered
          accordingly.  If ``False`` the label is rendered as its textual
          representation according to the ``_repr`` method.  Support for
          arbitrarily-complicated mathematics is not especially robust.

        - ``vertex_label_color`` -- default: 'black' -- a single color to use
          as the default for labels of vertices. See the explanation above
          for the ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.

        - ``vertex_label_colors`` --  a dictionary whose keys are vertices
          of the graph and whose values are colors.  These will be used
          for the text of the labels of vertices.  See the explanation
          above for the ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.
          These values need only be specified for a proper subset of the
          vertices.  Specified values will supersede a default value.

        - ``vertex_label_placement`` -- default: 'center' --  if 'center'
          the label is centered in the interior of the vertex and the vertex
          will expand to contain the label.  Giving instead a pair of numbers
          will place the label exterior to the vertex at a certain distance
          from the edge, and at an angle to the positive x-axis, similar
          in spirt to polar coordinates.

        - ``vertex_label_placements`` -- a dictionary of placements
          indexed by the vertices.  See the explanation for
          ``vertex_label_placement`` for the possible values.

        - ``edge_color`` -- default: 'black' -- a single color to use as
          the default for an edge. See the explanation above for the
          ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.

        - ``edge_colors`` -- a dictionary whose keys are edges of the
          graph and whose values are colors.  These will be used to
          color the edges.See the explanation above for the
          ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.  These
          values need only be specified for a proper subset of the
          vertices.  Specified values will supersede a default value.

        - ``edge_fills`` -- default: ``False`` -- a boolean that
          determines if an edge has a second color running down
          the middle.  This can be a useful effect for highlighting
          edge crossings.

        - ``edge_fill_color`` -- default: 'black' -- a single color
          to use as the default for the fill color of an edge.
          The boolean switch ``edge_fills`` must be set to True
          for theis to have an effect.  See the explanation above
          for the ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.

        - ``edge__fill_colors`` -- a dictionary whose keys are edges
          of the graph and whose values are colors. See the explanation
          above for the ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.
          These values need only be specified for a proper subset of the
          vertices.  Specified values will supersede a default value.

        - ``edge_thickness`` -- default: 0.1 - a number specifying the
          width of the edges.  Note that tkz-graph does not interpret
          this number for loops.

        - ``edge_thicknesses`` -- a dictionary of thicknesses for
          some of the edges of a graph.  These values need only
          be specified for a proper subset of the vertices.  Specified
          values will supersede a default value.

        - ``edge_labels`` -- default: ``False`` -- a boolean that
          determines if edge labels are shown.  If ``False`` subsequent
          options about edge labels are ignored.

        - ``edge_labels_math`` -- default:  ``True`` -- a boolean that
          controls how edge labels are rendered.  Read the explanation
          for the ``vertex_labels_math`` option, which behaves identically.
          Support for arbitrarily-complicated mathematics is not
          especially robust.

        - ``edge_label_color`` -- default: 'black' -- a single color
          to use as the default for labels of edges.  See the explanation
          above for the ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.

        - ``edge_label_colors`` --  a dictionary whose keys are edges
          of the graph and whose values are colors.  These will be used
          for the text of the labels of edges.  See the explanation
          above for the ``vertex_color`` option to see possible values.
          These values need only be specified for a proper subset of
          the vertices.  Specified values will supersede a default
          value. Note that labels must be used for this to have any
          effect, and no care is taken to ensure that label and
          fill colors work well together.

        - ``edge_label_sloped`` -- default: ``True`` a boolean that
          specifies how edge labels are place.  ``False`` results
          in a horizontal label, while ``True`` means the label
          is rotated to follow the direction of the edge it labels.

        - ``edge_label_slopes`` -- a dictionary of booleans, indexed
          by some subset of the edges.  See the ``edge_label_sloped``
          option for a description of sloped edge labels.

        - ``edge_label_placement`` -- default: 0.50 -- a number between
          0.0 and 1.0, or one of: 'above', 'below', 'left', 'right'.  These
          adjust the location of an edge label along an edge.  A
          number specifies how far along the edge the label is
          located.  ``left`` and ``right`` are conveniences.
          ``above`` and ``below`` move the label off the edge
          itself while leaving it near the midpoint of the edge.
          The default value of ``0.50`` places the label on the
          midpoint of the edge.

        - ``edge_label_placements`` -- a dictionary of edge placements,
          indexed by the edges.  See the ``edge_label_placement`` option
          for a description of the allowable values.

        - ``loop_placement`` -- default: (3.0, 'NO') -- a pair,
          that determines how loops are rendered.  the first
          element of the pair is a distance, which determines
          how big the loop is and the second element is a string
          specifying a compass point (North, South, East, West)
          as one of 'NO','SO','EA','WE'.

        - ``loop_placements`` -- a dictionary of loop placements.
          See the ``loop_placements`` option for the allowable values.
          While loops are technically edges, this dictionary is
          indexed by vertices.

        For the 'dot2tex' format, the possible option names and
        associated values are given below:

        - ``prog`` -- the program used for the layout. It must be a
          string corresponding to one of the software of the graphviz
          suite: 'dot', 'neato', 'twopi', 'circo' or 'fdp'.

        - ``edge_labels`` -- a boolean (default: False). Whether to
          display the labels on edges.

        - ``edge_colors`` -- a color. Can be used to set a global
          color to the edge of the graph.

        - ``color_by_label`` - a boolean (default: False). Colors the
          edges according to their labels

        OUTPUTS:

        There are none.  Success happens silently.

        EXAMPLES:

        Set, then modify, then clear the ``tkz_style`` option, and
        finally show an error for an unrecognized option name::

        See :meth:`sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.layout_graphviz` for
        installation instructions for ``graphviz`` and ``dot2tex``. Further
        more, pgf >= 2.00 should be available inside LaTeX's tree for LaTeX
        compilation (e.g. when using ``view``). In case your LaTeX distribution
        does not provide it, here are short instructions:

           - download pgf from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/
           - unpack it in ``/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic`` (depends on your system)
           - clean out remaining pgf files from older version
           - run texhash

        Return a string of LaTeX commands representing a graph as a ``tikzpicture``.

        This routine interprets the graph's properties and the options in
        ``_options`` to render the graph with commands from the ``tkz-graph``
        LaTeX package.

        This requires that the LaTeX optional packages
        tkz-graph and tkz-berge be installed.  You may also need a
        current version of the pgf package.  If the tkz-graph and
        tkz-berge packages are present in the system's TeX
        installation, the appropriate ``\\usepackage{}`` commands
        will be added to the LaTeX preamble as part of
        the initialization of the graph. If these two packages
        are not present, then this command will return a warning
        on its first use, but will return a string that could be
        used elsewhere, such as a LaTeX document.

        For more information about tkz-graph you can visit
        `Altermundus.com <http://altermundus.com/>`_
