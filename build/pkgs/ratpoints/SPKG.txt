=== Note on SSE2 instructions ===

 * On several architectures, the SSE2 instructions used by ratpoints cause compiler errors. In the case that ratpoints fails to build with SSE2 instructions enabled, the build is repeated with SSE2 disabled.

== Changelog ==

=== ratpoints-2.1.3.p2 (Jeroen Demeyer, 13 February 2012) ===
 * #12368: Add compiler flag -fnested-functions if and only if it is
   supported by the C compiler.
 * Copy $CFLAGS (which is the standard variable for this) to $CCFLAGS
   (which is what ratpoints uses).

=== ratpoints-2.1.3.p1 (Jaap Spies, 24 Feb 2010) ===
 * #8351 make ratpoints build 64 bit for Open Solaris x64 with SAGE64=yes

=== ratpoints-2.1.3.p0 (William Stein, 14 Feb 2010) ===
 * Include change to spkg-install so that build works on Cygwin,
   a fix that was in (trac #7015), and somehow got lost.  See
   trac #8267.

=== ratpoints-2.1.3 (William Stein, 14 Feb 2010) ===
 * Evidently somebody updated ratpoints to 2.1.3 and didn't
   update the SPKG.txt.  Oops.  See below! jsp

=== ratpoints-2.1.2.p1 (William Stein, 8 July 2009) ===
 * add hgignore
 * fix mistake in spkg-install (!= versus -ne)
 * make work on 64-bit OS X

=== ratpoints-2.1.2 (Robert Miller, 22 April 2009) ===
 * Initial spkg
 * Work around SSE2 build issues by disabling on fail
 * Helped Michael Stoll fix several memory leaks.

=== ratpoints-2.1.3 (Robert Miller, 30 September 2009) ===
 * Updated to 2.1.3
