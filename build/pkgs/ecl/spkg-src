# Script to prepare a ECL tarball for Sage.  This script is only for the
# package maintainer, not for building ECL during a Sage install.
# WARNING: This script will delete/overwrite files in this directory
# and its subdirectories!
#
# HOW TO MAKE THE TARBALL:
# 1) sage --sh build/pkgs/ecl/spkg-src
#
# needs autotools and sage in your PATH.
