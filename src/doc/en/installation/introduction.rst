Introduction
============

You can install Sage either from a pre-built binary tarball or from
source. The binary method is fastest, and has the least
prerequisites. The source method gives you access to possibly a
slightly more up-to-date version of Sage, and ensures that you can
modify any of the Sage source code and recompile. Also, installing
from source should be simpler than you're used to with most
software, since much testing is done to make sure Sage and all its
components can be successfully compiled with no user interaction on
a range of computers. Thus it's probably easier for you to build
all of Sage from source than it would be for you to build some of
the packages that come with Sage (e.g., Singular).

The Sage distribution includes most programs on which Sage depends,
as listed in Table included. These programs are all released under
a GPL-compatible license (see the COPYING.txt file in the Sage home
directory for more details).
