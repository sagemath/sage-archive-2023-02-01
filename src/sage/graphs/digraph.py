    """Directed graph.

    A digraph or directed graph is a set of vertices connected by oriented
    edges. For more information, see the
    `Wikipedia article on digraphs
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_%28mathematics%29>`_.

    One can very easily create a directed graph in Sage by typing::

        sage: g = DiGraph()

    By typing the name of the digraph, one can get some basic information
    about it::

        sage: g
        Digraph on 0 vertices

    This digraph is not very interesting as it is by default the empty
    graph. But Sage contains several pre-defined digraph classes that can
    be listed this way:

    * Within a Sage sessions, type ``digraphs.``
      (Do not press "Enter", and do not forget the final period "." )
    * Hit "tab".

    You will see a list of methods which will construct named digraphs. For
    example::

        sage: g = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(3)
        sage: g.plot()
        Graphics object consisting of 81 graphics primitives

    You can also use the collection of pre-defined graphs, then create a
    digraph from them. ::

        sage: g = DiGraph(graphs.PetersenGraph())
        sage: g.plot()
        Graphics object consisting of 50 graphics primitives

    Calling ``Digraph`` on a graph returns the original graph in which every
    edge is replaced by two different edges going toward opposite directions.

    In order to obtain more information about these digraph constructors,
    access the documentation by typing ``digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP?``.

    Once you have defined the digraph you want, you can begin to work on it
    by using the almost 200 functions on graphs and digraphs in the Sage
    library! If your digraph is named ``g``, you can list these functions as
    previously this way

    * Within a Sage session, type ``g.``
      (Do not press "Enter", and do not forget the final period "." )
    * Hit "tab".

    As usual, you can get some information about what these functions do by
    typing (e.g. if you want to know about the ``diameter()`` method)
    ``g.diameter?``.

    If you have defined a digraph ``g`` having several connected components
    ( i.e. ``g.is_connected()`` returns False ), you can print each one of its
    connected components with only two lines::

        sage: for component in g.connected_components():
        ....:      g.subgraph(component).plot()
        Graphics object consisting of 50 graphics primitives

    The same methods works for strongly connected components ::

        sage: for component in g.strongly_connected_components():
        ....:      g.subgraph(component).plot()
        Graphics object consisting of 50 graphics primitives


    INPUT:

    -  ``data`` -  can be any of the following (see the ``format`` keyword):

       #.  A dictionary of dictionaries

       #.  A dictionary of lists

       #.  A Sage adjacency matrix or incidence matrix

       #.  A pygraphviz graph

       #.  A NetworkX digraph

       #.  An igraph Graph (see http://igraph.org/python/)

    -  ``pos`` - a positioning dictionary: for example, the
       spring layout from NetworkX for the 5-cycle is::

         {0: [-0.91679746, 0.88169588],
          1: [ 0.47294849, 1.125     ],
          2: [ 1.125     ,-0.12867615],
          3: [ 0.12743933,-1.125     ],
          4: [-1.125     ,-0.50118505]}

    -  ``name`` - (must be an explicitly named parameter,
       i.e., name="complete") gives the graph a name

    -  ``loops`` - boolean, whether to allow loops (ignored
       if data is an instance of the DiGraph class)

    -  ``multiedges`` - boolean, whether to allow multiple
       edges (ignored if data is an instance of the DiGraph class)

    -  ``weighted`` - whether digraph thinks of itself as
       weighted or not. See self.weighted()

    -  ``format`` - if None, DiGraph tries to guess- can be
       several values, including:

       -  ``'adjacency_matrix'`` - a square Sage matrix M,
          with M[i,j] equal to the number of edges {i,j}

       -  ``'incidence_matrix'`` - a Sage matrix, with one
          column C for each edge, where if C represents {i, j}, C[i] is -1
          and C[j] is 1

       -  ``'weighted_adjacency_matrix'`` - a square Sage
          matrix M, with M[i,j] equal to the weight of the single edge {i,j}.
          Given this format, weighted is ignored (assumed True).

       -  ``NX`` - data must be a NetworkX DiGraph.

           .. NOTE::

               As Sage's default edge labels is ``None`` while NetworkX uses
               ``{}``, the ``{}`` labels of a NetworkX digraph are automatically
               set to ``None`` when it is converted to a Sage graph. This
               behaviour can be overruled by setting the keyword
               ``convert_empty_dict_labels_to_None`` to ``False`` (it is
               ``True`` by default).

       -  ``igraph`` - data must be an igraph directed Graph.

    - ``sparse`` (boolean) -- ``sparse=True`` is an alias for
      ``data_structure="sparse"``, and ``sparse=False`` is an alias for
      ``data_structure="dense"``.

    - ``data_structure`` -- one of the following (for more information, see
      :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.overview`):

       * ``"dense"`` -- selects the :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.dense_graph`
         backend.

       * ``"sparse"`` -- selects the :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph`
         backend.

       * ``"static_sparse"`` -- selects the
         :mod:`~sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend` (this backend is faster
         than the sparse backend and smaller in memory, and it is immutable, so
         that the resulting graphs can be used as dictionary keys).

    - ``immutable`` (boolean) -- whether to create a immutable digraph. Note
      that ``immutable=True`` is actually a shortcut for
      ``data_structure='static_sparse'``.

    - ``vertex_labels`` - Whether to allow any object as a vertex (slower), or
      only the integers 0, ..., n-1, where n is the number of vertices.

    -  ``convert_empty_dict_labels_to_None`` - this arguments sets
       the default edge labels used by NetworkX (empty dictionaries)
       to be replaced by None, the default Sage edge label. It is
       set to ``True`` iff a NetworkX graph is on the input.

    EXAMPLES:

    #. A dictionary of dictionaries::

            sage: g = DiGraph({0:{1:'x',2:'z',3:'a'}, 2:{5:'out'}}); g
            Digraph on 5 vertices

       The labels ('x', 'z', 'a', 'out') are labels for edges. For
       example, 'out' is the label for the edge from 2 to 5. Labels can be
       used as weights, if all the labels share some common parent.

    #. A dictionary of lists (or iterables)::

            sage: g = DiGraph({0:[1,2,3], 2:[4]}); g
            Digraph on 5 vertices
            sage: g = DiGraph({0:(1,2,3), 2:(4,)}); g
            Digraph on 5 vertices

    #. A list of vertices and a function describing adjacencies. Note
       that the list of vertices and the function must be enclosed in a
       list (i.e., [list of vertices, function]).

       We construct a graph on the integers 1 through 12 such that there
       is a directed edge from i to j if and only if i divides j.

       ::

            sage: g=DiGraph([[1..12],lambda i,j: i!=j and i.divides(j)])
            sage: g.vertices()
            [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
            sage: g.adjacency_matrix()
            [0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
            [0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]
            [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

    #. A Sage matrix: Note: If format is not specified, then Sage
       assumes a square matrix is an adjacency matrix, and a nonsquare
       matrix is an incidence matrix.

       - an adjacency matrix::

            sage: M = Matrix([[0, 1, 1, 1, 0],[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],[0, 0, 0, 0, 1],[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]); M
            [0 1 1 1 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 1]
            [0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0]
            sage: DiGraph(M)
            Digraph on 5 vertices

            sage: M = Matrix([[0,1,-1],[-1,0,-1/2],[1,1/2,0]]); M
            [   0    1   -1]
            [  -1    0 -1/2]
            [   1  1/2    0]
            sage: G = DiGraph(M,sparse=True); G
            Digraph on 3 vertices
            sage: G.weighted()
            True

       - an incidence matrix::

            sage: M = Matrix(6, [-1,0,0,0,1, 1,-1,0,0,0, 0,1,-1,0,0, 0,0,1,-1,0, 0,0,0,1,-1, 0,0,0,0,0]); M
            [-1  0  0  0  1]
            [ 1 -1  0  0  0]
            [ 0  1 -1  0  0]
            [ 0  0  1 -1  0]
            [ 0  0  0  1 -1]
            [ 0  0  0  0  0]
            sage: DiGraph(M)
            Digraph on 6 vertices

    #. A dig6 string: Sage automatically recognizes whether a string is
       in dig6 format, which is a directed version of graph6::

            sage: D = DiGraph('IRAaDCIIOWEOKcPWAo')
            sage: D
            Digraph on 10 vertices

            sage: D = DiGraph('IRAaDCIIOEOKcPWAo')
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: The string (IRAaDCIIOEOKcPWAo) seems corrupt: for n = 10, the string is too short.

            sage: D = DiGraph("IRAaDCI'OWEOKcPWAo")
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: The string seems corrupt: valid characters are
            ?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~

    #. A NetworkX XDiGraph::

            sage: import networkx
            sage: g = networkx.MultiDiGraph({0:[1,2,3], 2:[4]})
            sage: DiGraph(g)
            Digraph on 5 vertices


    #. A NetworkX digraph::

            sage: import networkx
            sage: g = networkx.DiGraph({0:[1,2,3], 2:[4]})
            sage: DiGraph(g)
            Digraph on 5 vertices

    #. An igraph directed Graph (see also
       :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.igraph_graph`)::

           sage: import igraph                                  # optional - python_igraph
           sage: g = igraph.Graph([(0,1),(0,2)], directed=True) # optional - python_igraph
           sage: DiGraph(g)                                     # optional - python_igraph
           Digraph on 3 vertices

       If ``vertex_labels`` is ``True``, the names of the vertices are given by
       the vertex attribute ``'name'``, if available::

           sage: g = igraph.Graph([(0,1),(0,2)], directed=True, vertex_attrs={'name':['a','b','c']})  # optional - python_igraph
           sage: DiGraph(g).vertices()                                                                # optional - python_igraph
           ['a', 'b', 'c']
           sage: g = igraph.Graph([(0,1),(0,2)], directed=True, vertex_attrs={'label':['a','b','c']}) # optional - python_igraph
           sage: DiGraph(g).vertices()                                                                # optional - python_igraph
           [0, 1, 2]

       If the igraph Graph has edge attributes, they are used as edge labels::

           sage: g = igraph.Graph([(0,1),(0,2)], directed=True, edge_attrs={'name':['a','b'], 'weight':[1,3]}) # optional - python_igraph
           sage: DiGraph(g).edges()                                                                            # optional - python_igraph
           [(0, 1, {'name': 'a', 'weight': 1}), (0, 2, {'name': 'b', 'weight': 3})]


    TESTS::

        sage: DiGraph({0:[1,2,3], 2:[4]}).edges()
        [(0, 1, None), (0, 2, None), (0, 3, None), (2, 4, None)]
        sage: DiGraph({0:(1,2,3), 2:(4,)}).edges()
        [(0, 1, None), (0, 2, None), (0, 3, None), (2, 4, None)]
        sage: DiGraph({0:Set([1,2,3]), 2:Set([4])}).edges()
        [(0, 1, None), (0, 2, None), (0, 3, None), (2, 4, None)]

    Demonstrate that digraphs using the static backend are equal to mutable
    graphs but can be used as dictionary keys::

        sage: import networkx
        sage: g = networkx.DiGraph({0:[1,2,3], 2:[4]})
        sage: G = DiGraph(g)
        sage: G_imm = DiGraph(G, data_structure="static_sparse")
        sage: H_imm = DiGraph(G, data_structure="static_sparse")
        sage: H_imm is G_imm
        False
        sage: H_imm == G_imm == G
        True
        sage: {G_imm:1}[H_imm]
        1
        sage: {G_imm:1}[G]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. Create an
        immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`

    The error message states that one can also create immutable graphs by
    specifying the ``immutable`` optional argument (not only by
    ``data_structure='static_sparse'`` as above)::

        sage: J_imm = DiGraph(G, immutable=True)
        sage: J_imm == G_imm
        True
        sage: type(J_imm._backend) == type(G_imm._backend)

    ### Properties

    def is_directed_acyclic(self, certificate = False):
        """
        Returns whether the digraph is acyclic or not.

        A directed graph is acyclic if for any vertex `v`, there is no directed
        path that starts and ends at `v`. Every directed acyclic graph (DAG)
        corresponds to a partial ordering of its vertices, however multiple dags
        may lead to the same partial ordering.

        INPUT:

        - ``certificate`` -- whether to return a certificate (``False`` by
          default).

        OUTPUT:

            * When ``certificate=False``, returns a boolean value.

            * When ``certificate=True`` :

                * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
                  where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
                  appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.

                * Else, returns a pair ``(False, cycle)`` where ``cycle`` is a
                  list of vertices representing a circuit in the graph.

        EXAMPLES:

        At first, the following graph is acyclic::

            sage: D = DiGraph({ 0:[1,2,3], 4:[2,5], 1:[8], 2:[7], 3:[7], 5:[6,7], 7:[8], 6:[9], 8:[10], 9:[10] })
            sage: D.plot(layout='circular').show()
            sage: D.is_directed_acyclic()
            True

        Adding an edge from `9` to `7` does not change it::

            sage: D.add_edge(9,7)
            sage: D.is_directed_acyclic()
            True

        We can obtain as a proof an ordering of the vertices such that `u`
        appears before `v` if `uv` is an edge of the graph::

            sage: D.is_directed_acyclic(certificate = True)
            (True, [4, 5, 6, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10])

        Adding an edge from 7 to 4, though, makes a difference::

            sage: D.add_edge(7,4)
            sage: D.is_directed_acyclic()
            False

        Indeed, it creates a circuit `7, 4, 5`::

            sage: D.is_directed_acyclic(certificate = True)
            (False, [7, 4, 5])

        Checking acyclic graphs are indeed acyclic ::

            sage: def random_acyclic(n, p):
            ...    g = graphs.RandomGNP(n, p)
            ...    h = DiGraph()
            ...    h.add_edges([ ((u,v) if u<v else (v,u)) for u,v,_ in g.edges() ])
            ...    return h
            ...
            sage: all( random_acyclic(100, .2).is_directed_acyclic()    # long time
            ...        for i in range(50))                              # long time
            True

        r"""
        Computes the minimum feedback edge set of a digraph (also called
        feedback arc set).

        The minimum feedback edge set of a digraph is a set of edges that
        intersect all the circuits of the digraph.  Equivalently, a minimum
        feedback arc set of a DiGraph is a set `S` of arcs such that the digraph
        `G-S` is acyclic. For more information, see the `Wikipedia article on
        feedback arc sets <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set>`_.

        INPUT:

        - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)

          - When set to ``True``, only the minimum cardinal of a minimum edge
            set is returned.

          - When set to ``False``, the ``Set`` of edges of a minimal edge set is
            returned.

        - ``constraint_generation`` (boolean) -- whether to use constraint
          generation when solving the Mixed Integer Linear Program (default:
          ``True``).

        - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
          solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
          more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see
          the method
          :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
          of the class
          :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

        - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
          verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

        ALGORITHM:

        This problem is solved using Linear Programming, in two different
        ways. The first one is to solve the following formulation:

        .. MATH::

            \mbox{Minimize : }&\sum_{(u,v)\in G} b_{(u,v)}\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\\
            &\forall (u,v)\in G, d_u-d_v+ n \cdot b_{(u,v)}\geq 0\\
            &\forall u\in G, 0\leq d_u\leq |G|\\

        An explanation:

        An acyclic digraph can be seen as a poset, and every poset has a linear
        extension. This means that in any acyclic digraph the vertices can be
        ordered with a total order `<` in such a way that if `(u,v)\in G`, then
        `u<v`.

        Thus, this linear program is built in order to assign to each vertex `v`
        a number `d_v\in [0,\dots,n-1]` such that if there exists an edge
        `(u,v)\in G` such that `d_v<d_u`, then the edge `(u,v)` is removed.

        The number of edges removed is then minimized, which is the objective.

        (Constraint Generation)

        If the parameter ``constraint_generation`` is enabled, a more efficient
        formulation is used :

        .. MATH::

            \mbox{Minimize : }&\sum_{(u,v)\in G} b_{(u,v)}\\
            \mbox{Such that : }&\\
            &\forall C\text{ circuits }\subseteq G, \sum_{uv\in C}b_{(u,v)}\geq 1\\

        As the number of circuits contained in a graph is exponential, this LP
        is solved through constraint generation. This means that the solver is
        sequentially asked to solved the problem, knowing only a portion of the
        circuits contained in `G`, each time adding to the list of its
        constraints the circuit which its last answer had left intact.

        EXAMPLES:

        If the digraph is created from a graph, and hence is symmetric (if `uv`
        is an edge, then `vu` is an edge too), then obviously the cardinality of
        its feedback arc set is the number of edges in the first graph::

            sage: cycle=graphs.CycleGraph(5)
            sage: dcycle=DiGraph(cycle)
            sage: cycle.size()
            5
            sage: dcycle.feedback_edge_set(value_only=True)
            5

        And in this situation, for any edge `uv` of the first graph, `uv` of
        `vu` is in the returned feedback arc set::

           sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(5,.3)
           sage: dg = DiGraph(g)
           sage: feedback = dg.feedback_edge_set()
           sage: (u,v,l) = next(g.edge_iterator())
           sage: (u,v) in feedback or (v,u) in feedback
           True

           - If set to ``True``, input graph will be forced to allow parallel
             edges if necessary and edge `(1,2)` will appear twice in the graph.

           - If set to ``False``, only one edge `(1,2)` will remain in the graph
             after `(2,1)` is reversed. Besides, the label of edge `(1,2)` will
             be overwritten with the label of edge `(2,1)`.

           The default behaviour (``multiedges = None``) will raise an exception
           each time a subjective decision (setting ``multiedges`` to ``True``
           or ``False``) is necessary to perform the operation.

        The following forms are all accepted:

        - D.reverse_edge( 1, 2 )
        - D.reverse_edge( (1, 2) )
        - D.reverse_edge( [1, 2] )
        - D.reverse_edge( 1, 2, 'label' )
        - D.reverse_edge( ( 1, 2, 'label') )
        - D.reverse_edge( [1, 2, 'label'] )
        - D.reverse_edge( ( 1, 2), label='label') )

        EXAMPLES:

        If ``inplace`` is ``True`` (default value), ``self`` is modified::

            sage: D = DiGraph([(0,1,2)])
            sage: D.reverse_edge(0,1)
            sage: D.edges()
            [(1, 0, 2)]

        If ``inplace`` is ``False``, ``self`` is not modified
        and a new digraph is returned::

            sage: D = DiGraph([(0,1,2)])
            sage: re = D.reverse_edge(0,1, inplace=False)
            sage: re.edges()
            [(1, 0, 2)]
            sage: D.edges()
            [(0, 1, 2)]

        If ``multiedges`` is ``True``, ``self`` will be forced to allow parallel
        edges when and only when it is necessary::

            sage: D = DiGraph( [(1, 2, 'A'), (2, 1, 'A'), (2, 3, None)] )
            sage: D.reverse_edge(1,2, multiedges=True)
            sage: D.edges()
            [(2, 1, 'A'), (2, 1, 'A'), (2, 3, None)]
            sage: D.allows_multiple_edges()
            True

        Even if ``multiedges`` is ``True``, ``self`` will not be forced to allow
        parallel edges when it is not necessary::

            sage: D = DiGraph( [(1,2,'A'), (2,1,'A'), (2, 3, None)] )
            sage: D.reverse_edge(2,3, multiedges=True)
            sage: D.edges()
            [(1, 2, 'A'), (2, 1, 'A'), (3, 2, None)]
            sage: D.allows_multiple_edges()
            False

        If user specifies ``multiedges = False``, ``self`` will not be forced to
        allow parallel edges and a parallel edge will get deleted::

            sage: D = DiGraph( [(1, 2, 'A'), (2, 1,'A'), (2, 3, None)] )
            sage: D.edges()
            [(1, 2, 'A'), (2, 1, 'A'), (2, 3, None)]
            sage: D.reverse_edge(1,2, multiedges=False)
            sage: D.edges()
            [(2, 1, 'A'), (2, 3, None)]

        Note that in the following graph, specifying ``multiedges = False`` will
        result in overwriting the label of `(1,2)` with the label of `(2,1)`::

            sage: D = DiGraph( [(1, 2, 'B'), (2, 1,'A'), (2, 3, None)] )
            sage: D.edges()
            [(1, 2, 'B'), (2, 1, 'A'), (2, 3, None)]
            sage: D.reverse_edge(2,1, multiedges=False)
            sage: D.edges()
            [(1, 2, 'A'), (2, 3, None)]

        If input edge in digraph has weight/label, then the weight/label should
        be preserved in the output digraph.  User does not need to specify the
        weight/label when calling function::

            sage: D = DiGraph([[0,1,2],[1,2,1]], weighted=True)
            sage: D.reverse_edge(0,1)
            sage: D.edges()
            [(1, 0, 2), (1, 2, 1)]
            sage: re = D.reverse_edge([1,2],inplace=False)
            sage: re.edges()
            [(1, 0, 2), (2, 1, 1)]

        If ``self`` has multiple copies (parallel edges) of the input edge, only
        1 of the parallel edges is reversed::

            sage: D = DiGraph([(0,1,'01'),(0,1,'01'),(0,1,'cat'),(1,2,'12')], weighted = True, multiedges = true)
            sage: re = D.reverse_edge([0,1,'01'],inplace=False)
            sage: re.edges()
            [(0, 1, '01'), (0, 1, 'cat'), (1, 0, '01'), (1, 2, '12')]

        If ``self`` has multiple copies (parallel edges) of the input edge but
        with distinct labels and no input label is specified, only 1 of the
        parallel edges is reversed (the edge that is labeled by the first label
        on the list returned by :meth:`.edge_label`)::

            sage: D = DiGraph([(0,1,'A'),(0,1,'B'),(0,1,'mouse'),(0,1,'cat')], multiedges = true)
            sage: D.edge_label(0,1)
            ['cat', 'mouse', 'B', 'A']
            sage: D.reverse_edge(0,1)
            sage: D.edges()
            [(0, 1, 'A'), (0, 1, 'B'), (0, 1, 'mouse'), (1, 0, 'cat')]

        Finally, an exception is raised when Sage does not know how to chose
        between allowing multiple edges and losing some data::

            sage: D = DiGraph([(0,1,'A'),(1,0,'B')])
            sage: D.reverse_edge(0,1)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...

            edges but input digraph doesn't allow them - User needs to specify

        The following syntax is supported, but note that you must use
        the ``label`` keyword::

            sage: D = DiGraph()
            sage: D.add_edge((1,2), label='label')
            sage: D.edges()

            sage: D.edges()

        One may wish to enumerate simple paths, which are paths in which
        no two arcs share a head or share a tail, i.e. every vertex in
        the path is entered at most once and exited at most once. The
        result is always finite but may take a long time to compute::

            sage: list(pi)
            [['d', 'c'], ['d', 'c', 'd']]

        It is possible to specify the allowed ending vertices::

            sage: pi = g._all_paths_iterator('a', ending_vertices=['c'])
            sage: for _ in range(5): print next(pi)
            ['a', 'b', 'c']
            ['a', 'a', 'b', 'c']
            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c']
            ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'c']
            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c']
            sage: pi = g._all_paths_iterator('a', ending_vertices=['a', 'b'])

            ['a', 'a', 'b']
            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

        One can bound the length of the paths::

            sage: pi = g._all_paths_iterator('d', max_length=3)
            sage: list(pi)
            [['d', 'c'], ['d', 'c', 'd'], ['d', 'c', 'd', 'c']]

        Or include the trivial empty path::

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: g = DiGraph({'a' : ['a', 'b'], 'b' : ['c'], 'c' : ['d'], 'd' : ['c']}, loops=True)
            sage: pi = g.all_paths_iterator()

            ['d', 'c']
            ['a', 'a', 'a']
            ['a', 'a', 'b']

        It is possible to precise the allowed starting and/or ending vertices::

            sage: pi = g.all_paths_iterator(starting_vertices=['a'])
            sage: for _ in range(5): print next(pi)
            ['a', 'a']

            sage: pi = g.all_paths_iterator(starting_vertices=['a'], ending_vertices=['b'])

            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b']
            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b']

        One may prefer to enumerate only simple paths (see
        :meth:`all_simple_paths`)::

            sage: pi = g.all_paths_iterator(simple=True)
            sage: list(pi)
            [['a', 'a'], ['a', 'b'], ['b', 'c'], ['c', 'd'], ['d', 'c'],

             ['d', 'c', 'd'], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]

        Or simply bound the length of the enumerated paths::

            sage: pi = g.all_paths_iterator(starting_vertices=['a'], ending_vertices=['b', 'c'], max_length=6)

           vertices of the graph can be starting points.
        -  ``simple`` - boolean (default: False). If set to True,
           then only simple cycles are considered. A cycle is simple
           if the only vertex occuring twice in it is the starting
           and ending one.
        -  ``rooted`` - boolean (default: False). If set to False,
           then cycles differing only by their starting vertex are
           considered the same  (e.g. ``['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']`` and
           ``['b', 'c', 'a', 'b']``). Otherwise, all cycles are enumerated.
        -  ``max_length`` - non negative integer (default: None).
           The maximum length of the enumerated cycles. If set to None,
           then all lengths are allowed.
        -  ``trivial`` - boolean (default: False). If set to True,
           then the empty cycles are also enumerated.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: g = DiGraph({'a' : ['a', 'b'], 'b' : ['c'], 'c' : ['d'], 'd' : ['c']}, loops=True)
            sage: it = g.all_cycles_iterator()
            sage: for _ in range(7): print next(it)
            ['a', 'a']
            ['a', 'a', 'a']
            ['c', 'd', 'c']
            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
            ['c', 'd', 'c', 'd', 'c']
            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

        There are no cycles in the empty graph and in acyclic graphs::

            sage: g = DiGraph()
            sage: it = g.all_cycles_iterator()
            sage: list(it)
            []
            sage: g = DiGraph({0:[1]})
            sage: it = g.all_cycles_iterator()
            sage: list(it)
            []

        It is possible to restrict the starting vertices of the cycles::

            sage: g = DiGraph({'a' : ['a', 'b'], 'b' : ['c'], 'c' : ['d'], 'd' : ['c']}, loops=True)
            sage: it = g.all_cycles_iterator(starting_vertices=['b', 'c'])
            sage: for _ in range(3): print next(it)
            ['c', 'd', 'c']
            ['c', 'd', 'c', 'd', 'c']
            ['c', 'd', 'c', 'd', 'c', 'd', 'c']

        Also, one can bound the length of the cycles::

            sage: it = g.all_cycles_iterator(max_length=3)
            sage: list(it)
            [['a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['c', 'd', 'c'],
             ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

        By default, cycles differing only by their starting point are not all
        enumerated, but this may be parametrized::

            sage: it = g.all_cycles_iterator(max_length=3, rooted=False)
            sage: list(it)
            [['a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['c', 'd', 'c'],
             ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]
            sage: it = g.all_cycles_iterator(max_length=3, rooted=True)
            sage: list(it)
            [['a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['c', 'd', 'c'], ['d', 'c', 'd'],
             ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

        One may prefer to enumerate simple cycles, i.e. cycles such that the only
        vertex occuring twice in it is the starting and ending one (see also
        :meth:`all_simple_cycles`)::

            sage: it = g.all_cycles_iterator(simple=True)
            sage: list(it)
            [['a', 'a'], ['c', 'd', 'c']]
            sage: g = digraphs.Circuit(4)
            sage: list(g.all_cycles_iterator(simple=True))

        By default, the labels are discarded, and the result has no
        loops nor multiple edges. If ``keep_labels`` is ``True``, then
        the labels are kept, and the result is a multi digraph,
        possibly with multiple edges and loops. However, edges in the
        result with same source, target, and label are not duplicated
        (see the edges from 0 to the strongly connected component
        `\{1,2\}` below)::

    def flow_polytope(self, edges=None, ends=None):
        r"""
        Return the flow polytope of a digraph.

        The flow polytope of a directed graph is the polytope
        consisting of all nonnegative flows on the graph with
        a given set `S` of sources and a given set `T` of sinks.

        A *flow* on a directed graph `G` with a given set `S` of
        sources and a given set `T` of sinks means an assignment
        of a nonnegative real to each edge of `G` such that the
        flow is conserved in each vertex outside of `S` and `T`,
        and there is a unit of flow entering each vertex in `S`
        and a unit of flow leaving each vertex in `T`. These
        flows clearly form a polytope in the space of all
        assignments of reals to the edges of `G`.

        The polytope is empty unless the sets `S` and `T` are
        equinumerous.

        By default, `S` is taken to be the set of all sources
        (i.e., vertices of indegree `0`) of `G`, and `T` is taken
        to be the set of all sinks (i.e., vertices of outdegree
        `0`) of `G`. If a different choice of `S` and `T` is
        desired, it can be specified using the optional ``ends`` parameter.

        The polytope is returned as a polytope in `\RR^m`, where
        `m` is the number of edges of the digraph ``self``. The
        `k`-th coordinate of a point in the polytope is the real
        assigned to the `k`-th edge of ``self``. The order of the
        edges is the one returned by ``self.edges()``. If a
        different order is desired, it can be specified using the
        optional ``edges`` parameter.

        The faces and volume of these polytopes are of interest. Examples of
        these polytopes are the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope and the
        Pitman-Stanley polytope [PitSta]_.

        INPUT:

        - ``edges`` -- (optional, default: ``self.edges()``) a list or tuple
          of all edges of ``self`` (each only once). This
          determines which coordinate of a point in the polytope will
          correspond to which edge of ``self``. It is also possible
          to specify a list which contains not all edges of ``self``;
          this results in a polytope corresponding to the flows which
          are `0` on all remaining edges. Notice that the edges
          entered here must be in the precisely same format as
          outputted by ``self.edges()``; so, if ``self.edges()``
          outputs an edge in the form ``(1, 3, None)``, then
          ``(1, 3)`` will not do!

        - ``ends`` -- (optional, default: ``(self.sources(), self.sinks())``)
          a pair `(S, T)` of an iterable `S` and an iterable `T`.

        .. NOTE::

            Flow polytopes can also be built through the ``polytopes.<tab>``
