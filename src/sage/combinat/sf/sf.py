    The abstract algebra of commutative symmetric functions

    .. rubric:: Symmetric Functions in Sage

    .. MODULEAUTHOR:: Jason Bandlow, Anne Schilling, Nicolas M. Thiery, Mike Zabrocki

    This document is an introduction to working with symmetric function
    theory in Sage.
    It is not intended to be an introduction to the theory
    of symmetric functions ([MAC]_ and [STA]_, Chapter 7, are two excellent
    references.)  The reader is also expected to be familiar with Sage.

    .. rubric:: The algebra of symmetric functions

    The algebra of symmetric functions is the unique free commutative graded
    connected algebra over the given ring, with one generator in each degree.  It
    can also be thought of as the inverse limit (in the category of graded
    algebras) of the algebra of symmetric polynomials in `n` variables as `n \rightarrow \infty`.
    Sage allows us to construct the algebra of symmetric functions over
    any ring.  We will use a base ring of rational numbers in these first
    examples::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
        sage: Sym
        Symmetric Functions over Rational Field

    Sage knows certain categorical information about this algebra::

        sage: Sym.category()
        Join of Category of hopf algebras over Rational Field
            and Category of graded algebras over Rational Field
            and Category of commutative algebras over Rational Field
            and Category of monoids with realizations
            and Category of graded coalgebras over Rational Field
            and Category of coalgebras over Rational Field with realizations
            and Category of cocommutative coalgebras over Rational Field

    Notice that ``Sym`` is an *abstract* algebra.  This reflects the fact that
    there are multiple natural bases.  To work with specific
    elements, we need a *realization* of this algebra.  In practice, this
    means we need to specify a basis.

    .. rubric:: An example basis - power sums

    Here is an example of how one might use the power sum realization::

        sage: p = Sym.powersum()
        sage: p
        Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis

    ``p`` now represents the realization of the symmetric function algebra on
    the power sum basis.  The basis itself is accessible through::

        sage: p.basis()
        Lazy family (Term map from Partitions to Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis(i))_{i in Partitions}
        sage: p.basis().keys()
        Partitions

    This last line means that ``p.basis()`` is an association between the set
    of Partitions and the basis elements of the algebra ``p``. To construct a
    specific element one can therefore do::

        sage: p.basis()[Partition([2,1,1])]
        p[2, 1, 1]

    As this is rather cumbersome, realizations of the symmetric function
    algebra allow for the following abuses of notation::

        sage: p[Partition([2, 1, 1])]
        p[2, 1, 1]
        sage: p[[2, 1, 1]]
        p[2, 1, 1]
        sage: p[2, 1, 1]
        p[2, 1, 1]

    or even::

        sage: p[(i for i in [2, 1, 1])]
        p[2, 1, 1]

    In the special case of the empty partition, due to a limitation in
    Python syntax, one cannot use::

        sage: p[]       # todo: not implemented

    Please use instead::

        sage: p[[]]
        p[]

    .. note:: When elements are constructed using the ``p[something ]`` syntax ,
       an error will be raised if the input cannot be interpreted as a partition.
       This is *not* the case when ``p.basis()`` is used::

        sage: p['something']
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: all parts of 'something' should be nonnegative integers
        sage: p.basis()['something']
        p'something'

    Elements of ``p`` are linear combinations of such compositions::

      sage: p.an_element()
      2*p[] + 2*p[1] + 3*p[2]

    .. rubric:: Algebra structure

    Algebraic combinations of basis elements can be entered in a natural way::

        sage: p[2,1,1] + 2 * p[1] * (p[4] + p[2,1])
        3*p[2, 1, 1] + 2*p[4, 1]

    Let us explore the other operations of ``p``. We can ask for
    the mathematical properties of ``p``::

        sage: p.categories()
        [Category of graded bases of Symmetric Functions over Rational Field,
         Category of filtered bases of Symmetric Functions over Rational Field,
         Category of bases of Symmetric Functions over Rational Field,
         Category of graded hopf algebras with basis over Rational Field,
         ...]

    To start with, ``p`` is a graded algebra, the grading being induced
    by the size of the partitions. Due to this, the one is the basis
    element indexed by the empty partition::

        sage: p.one()
        p[]

    The ``p`` basis is multiplicative; that is, multiplication is induced by
    linearity from the (nonincreasingly sorted) concatenation of partitions::

        sage: p[3,1] * p[2,1]
        p[3, 2, 1, 1]

        sage: (p.one() + 2 * p[3,1]) * p[4, 2]
        p[4, 2] + 2*p[4, 3, 2, 1]

    .. rubric:: The classical bases

    In addition to the power sum basis, other classical bases of the
    symmetric function algebra include the elementary, complete
    homogeneous, monomial, and Schur bases::

        sage: e = Sym.elementary()
        sage: h = Sym.homogeneous()
        sage: m = Sym.monomial()
        sage: s = Sym.schur()

    These and others can be defined all at once with the single command::

        sage: Sym.inject_shorthands()
        Defining e as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the elementary basis
        Defining f as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the forgotten basis
        Defining h as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis
        Defining m as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis
        Defining p as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis
        Defining s as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the Schur basis

    We can then do conversions from one basis to another::

        sage: s(p[2,1])
        -s[1, 1, 1] + s[3]

        sage: m(p[3])
        m[3]
        sage: m(p[3,2])
        m[3, 2] + m[5]

    For computations which mix bases, Sage will return a result with respect
    to a single (not necessarily predictable) basis::

        sage: p[2] * s[2] - m[4]
        1/2*p[2, 1, 1] + 1/2*p[2, 2] - p[4]

        sage: p( m[1] * ( e[3]*s[2] + 1 ))
        p[1] + 1/12*p[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - 1/6*p[2, 1, 1, 1, 1] - 1/4*p[2, 2, 1, 1] + 1/6*p[3, 1, 1, 1] + 1/6*p[3, 2, 1]


    The one for different bases such as the power sum and Schur function is the same::

        sage: s.one() == p.one()
        True

    .. rubric:: Basic computations

    In this section, we explore some of the many methods that can be applied
    to an arbitrary symmetric function::

        sage: f = s[2]^2; f
        s[2, 2] + s[3, 1] + s[4]

    For more methods than discussed here, create a symmetric function as
    above, and use ``f.<tab>``.

    .. _`Representation theory of the symmetric group`:

    .. rubric:: Representation theory of the symmetric group

    The Schur functions `s_\lambda` can also be interpreted as irreducible characters of the symmetric
    group `S_n`, where `n` is the size of the partition `\lambda`. Since the Schur functions of
    degree `n` form a basis of the symmetric functions of degree `n`, it
    follows that an arbitrary symmetric function (homogeneous of degree
    `n`) may be interpreted as a function on the symmetric group. In this
    interpretation the power sum symmetric function `p_\lambda` is the characteristic
    function of the conjugacy class with shape `\lambda`, multiplied by the order of
    the centralizer of an element. Hence the irreducible characters can be computed
    as follows::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
        sage: s = Sym.schur()
        sage: p = Sym.power()
        sage: P = Partitions(5).list()
        sage: P = [P[i] for i in range(len(P)-1,-1,-1)]
        sage: M = matrix([[s[P[i]].scalar(p[P[j]]) for j in range(len(P))] for i in range(len(P))])
        sage: M
        [ 1 -1  1  1 -1 -1  1]
        [ 4 -2  0  1  1  0 -1]
        [ 5 -1  1 -1 -1  1  0]
        [ 6  0 -2  0  0  0  1]
        [ 5  1  1 -1  1 -1  0]
        [ 4  2  0  1 -1  0 -1]
        [ 1  1  1  1  1  1  1]

    We can indeed check that this agrees with the character table of `S_5`::

        sage: SymmetricGroup(5).character_table() == M
        True

    In this interpretation of symmetric functions as characters on the
    symmetric group, the multiplication and comultiplication are
    interpreted as induction (from `S_n\times S_m` to `S_{n+m}`)
    and restriction, respectively. The Schur functions can also be interpreted
    as characters of `GL_n`, see `Partitions and Schur functions`__.

    .. rubric:: The omega involution

    The `\omega` involution is the linear extension of the map which sends
    `e_\lambda` to `h_{\lambda}`::

        sage: h(f)
        h[2, 2]
        sage: e(f.omega())
        e[2, 2]

    .. rubric:: The Hall scalar product

    The Hall scalar product on the algebra of symmetric functions makes the
    Schur functions into an orthonormal basis::

        sage: f.scalar(f)
        3

    .. rubric:: Skewing

    *Skewing* is the adjoint operation to multiplication with respect to
    this scalar product::

        sage: f.skew_by(s[1])
        2*s[2, 1] + 2*s[3]

    In general, ``s[la].skew_by(s[mu])`` is the symmetric function typically
    denoted `s_{\lambda \setminus \mu}` or `s_{\lambda / \mu}`.

    .. rubric:: Expanding into variables

    We can expand a symmetric function into a symmetric polynomial in a
    specified number of variables::

        sage: f.expand(2)
        x0^4 + 2*x0^3*x1 + 3*x0^2*x1^2 + 2*x0*x1^3 + x1^4

    See the documentation for ``expand`` for more examples.

    .. rubric:: The Kronecker product

    As in the section on the `Representation theory of
    the symmetric group`_, a symmetric function may be considered as a
    class function on the symmetric group where the elements
    `p_\mu/z_\mu` are the indicators of a permutation having
    cycle structure `\mu`.  The Kronecker product of two
    symmetric functions corresponds to the pointwise product
    of these class functions.

    Since the Schur functions are the irreducible characters
    of the symmetric group under this identification, the Kronecker
    product of two Schur functions corresponds to the internal
    tensor product of two irreducible symmetric group representations.

    Under this identification, the Kronecker
    product of `p_\mu/z_\mu` and `p_\nu/z_\nu` is `p_\mu/z_\mu`
    if `\mu=\nu`, and the result is equal to `0` otherwise.

    ``internal_product``, ``kronecker_product``, ``inner_tensor`` and
    ``itensor`` are different names for the same function.

    ::

        sage: f.kronecker_product(f)
        s[1, 1, 1, 1] + 3*s[2, 1, 1] + 4*s[2, 2] + 5*s[3, 1] + 3*s[4]

    .. rubric:: Plethysm

    The *plethysm* of symmetric functions is the operation corresponding to
    composition of representations of the general linear group.  See [STA]_
    Chapter 7, Appendix 2 for details.
    ::

        sage: s[2].plethysm(s[2])
        s[2, 2] + s[4]

    Plethysm can also be written as a composition of functions::

        sage: s[2]( s[2] )
        s[2, 2] + s[4]

    If the coefficient ring contains degree 1 elements, these are handled
    properly by plethysm::

        sage: R.<t> = QQ[]; s = SymmetricFunctions(R).schur()
        sage: s[2]( (1-t)*s[1] )
        (t^2-t)*s[1, 1] + (-t+1)*s[2]

    See the documentation for ``plethysm`` for more information.

    .. rubric:: Inner plethysm

    The operation of inner plethysm ``f.inner_plethysm(g)`` models the
    composition of the `S_n` representation represented by `g` with the
    `GL_m` representation whose character is `f`.  See the documentation of
    ``inner_plethysm``, [ST94]_ or [STA]_, exercise 7.74 solutions for more
    information::

        sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
        sage: f = s[2]^2
        sage: f.inner_plethysm(s[2])
        s[2]

    .. rubric:: Hopf algebra structure

    The ring of symmetric functions is further endowed with a coalgebra
    structure. The coproduct is an algebra morphism, and therefore
    determined by its values on the generators; the power sum generators
    are primitive::

        sage: p[1].coproduct()
        p[] # p[1] + p[1] # p[]
        sage: p[2].coproduct()
        p[] # p[2] + p[2] # p[]

    The coproduct, being cocommutative on the generators, is cocommutative everywhere::

        sage: p[2, 1].coproduct()
        p[] # p[2, 1] + p[1] # p[2] + p[2] # p[1] + p[2, 1] # p[]

    This coproduct, along with the counit which sends every symmetric function
    to its `0`-th homogeneous component, makes the ring of symmetric functions
    into a graded connected bialgebra. It is known that every graded connected
    bialgebra has an antipode. For the ring of symmetric functions, the antipode
    can be characterized explicitly: The antipode is an anti-algebra morphism
    (thus an algebra morphism, since our algebra is commutative) which sends
    `p_{\lambda}` to `(-1)^{\mathrm{length}(\lambda)} p_{\lambda}` for every
    partition `\lambda`. Thus, in particular, it sends the generators on the
    ``p`` basis to their opposites::

        sage: p[3].antipode()
        -p[3]
        sage: p[3,2,1].antipode()
        -p[3, 2, 1]

    The graded connected bialgebra of symmetric functions over a `\QQ`-algebra
    has a rather simply-understood structure: It is (isomorphic to) the
    symmetric algebra of its space of primitives (which is spanned by the
    power-sum symmetric functions).

    Here are further examples::

        sage: f = s[2]^2
        sage: f.antipode()
        s[1, 1, 1, 1] + s[2, 1, 1] + s[2, 2]
        sage: f.coproduct()
        s[] # s[2, 2] + s[] # s[3, 1] + s[] # s[4] + 2*s[1] # s[2, 1] + 2*s[1] # s[3] + s[1, 1] # s[1, 1]
        + s[1, 1] # s[2] + s[2] # s[1, 1] + 3*s[2] # s[2] + 2*s[2, 1] # s[1] + s[2, 2] # s[] + 2*s[3] # s[1]
        + s[3, 1] # s[] + s[4] # s[]
        sage: f.coproduct().apply_multilinear_morphism( lambda x,y: x*y.antipode() )
        0

    .. rubric:: Transformations of symmetric functions

    There are many methods in Sage which make it easy to manipulate symmetric
    functions.  For example, if we have some function which acts on partitions
    (say, conjugation), it is a simple matter to apply it to the support of a
    symmetric function.  Here is an example::

        sage: conj = lambda mu: mu.conjugate()
        sage: f = h[4] + 2*h[3,1]
        sage: f.map_support(conj)
        h[1, 1, 1, 1] + 2*h[2, 1, 1]

    We can also easily modify the coefficients::

        sage: def foo(mu, coeff): return mu.conjugate(), -coeff
        sage: f.map_item(foo)
        -h[1, 1, 1, 1] - 2*h[2, 1, 1]

    See also ``map_coefficients``.

    There are also methods for building functions directly::

        sage: s.sum_of_monomials(mu for mu in Partitions(3))
        s[1, 1, 1] + s[2, 1] + s[3]
        sage: s.sum_of_monomials(Partitions(3))
        s[1, 1, 1] + s[2, 1] + s[3]
        sage: s.sum_of_terms( (mu, mu[0]) for mu in Partitions(3))
        s[1, 1, 1] + 2*s[2, 1] + 3*s[3]

    These are the preferred way to build elements within a program;
    the result will usually be faster than using :func:`sum`. It also
    guarantees that empty sums yields the zero of ``s`` (see also
    ``s.sum``).

    Note also that it is a good idea to use::

        sage: s.one()
        s[]
        sage: s.zero()
        0

    instead of ``s(1)`` and ``s(0)`` within programs where speed is important,
    in order to prevent unnecessary coercions.

    .. rubric:: Different base rings

    Depending on the base ring, the different realizations of the symmetric
    function algebra may not span the same space::

        sage: SZ = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ)
        sage: p = SZ.power(); s = SZ.schur()
        sage: p(s[1,1,1])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer

    Because of this, some functions may not behave as expected when working over
    the integers, even though they make mathematical sense::

        sage: s[1,1,1].plethysm(s[1,1,1])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer

    It is possible to work over different base rings simultaneously::

        sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
        sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).power()
        sage: sz = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).schur(); sz._prefix = 'sz'
        sage: pz = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).power(); pz._prefix = 'pz'
        sage: p(sz[1,1,1])
        1/6*p[1, 1, 1] - 1/2*p[2, 1] + 1/3*p[3]
        sage: sz( 1/6*p[1, 1, 1] - 1/2*p[2, 1] + 1/3*p[3] )
        sz[1, 1, 1]

    As shown in this example, if you are working over multiple base rings
    simultaneously, it is a good idea to change the prefix in some cases, so that
    you can tell from the output which realization your result is in.

    Let us change the notation back for the remainder of this tutorial::

        sage: sz._prefix = 's'
        sage: pz._prefix = 'p'

    One can also use the Sage standard renaming idiom to get shorter outputs::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
        sage: Sym.rename("Sym")
        sage: Sym
        Sym
        sage: Sym.rename()

    And we name it back::

        sage: Sym.rename("Symmetric Functions over Rational Field"); Sym
        Symmetric Functions over Rational Field

    .. rubric:: Other bases

    There are two additional basis of the symmetric functions which are not
    considered as classical bases:

    * forgotten basis
    * Witt basis

    The forgotten basis is the dual basis of the elementary symmetric
    functions basis with respect to the Hall scalar product. The Witt basis
    can be constructed by

    .. MATH::

        \prod_{d=1}^{\infty} (1 - w_d t^d)^{-1} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} h_n t^n

    where `t` is a formal variable.

    There are further bases of the ring of symmetric functions, in general over
    fields with parameters such as `q` and `t`:

    * Hall-Littlewood bases
    * Jack bases
    * Macdonald bases
    * `k`-Schur functions
    * Hecke character basis

    We briefly demonstrate how to access these bases. For more information, see
    the documentation of the individual bases.

    The *Jack polynomials* can be obtained as::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t']))
        sage: Jack = Sym.jack()
        sage: P = Jack.P(); J = Jack.J(); Q = Jack.Q()
        sage: J(P[2,1])
        (1/(t+2))*JackJ[2, 1]

    The parameter `t` can be specialized as follows::

        sage: Jack = Sym.jack(t = 1)
        sage: P = Jack.P(); J = Jack.J(); Q = Jack.Q()
        sage: J(P[2,1])
        1/3*JackJ[2, 1]

    Similarly one can access the Hall-Littlewood and Macdonald polynomials, etc::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q','t']))
        sage: Mcd = Sym.macdonald()
        sage: P = Mcd.P(); J = Mcd.J(); Q = Mcd.Q()
        sage: J(P[2,1])
        (1/(-q*t^4+2*q*t^3-q*t^2+t^2-2*t+1))*McdJ[2, 1]

    We can also construct the `\bar{q}` basis that can be used
    to determine character tables for Hecke algebras (with quadratic
    relation `T_i^2 = (1-q) T_i + q`)::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ['q'].fraction_field())
        sage: qbar = Sym.hecke_character()
        sage: s = Sym.s()
        sage: s(qbar[2,1])
        -s[1, 1, 1] + (q-1)*s[2, 1] + q*s[3]

    .. rubric:: `k`-Schur functions

    The `k`-Schur functions live in the `k`-bounded subspace of the ring of
    symmetric functions. It is possible to compute in the `k`-bounded subspace
    directly::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
        sage: ks = Sym.kschur(3,1)
        sage: f = ks[2,1]*ks[2,1]; f
        ks3[2, 2, 1, 1] + ks3[2, 2, 2] + ks3[3, 1, 1, 1]

    or to lift to the ring of symmetric functions::

        sage: f.lift()
        s[2, 2, 1, 1] + s[2, 2, 2] + s[3, 1, 1, 1] + 2*s[3, 2, 1] + s[3, 3] + s[4, 1, 1] + s[4, 2]

    However, it is not always possible to convert a symmetric function to the `k`-bounded subspace::

        sage: s = Sym.schur()
        sage: ks(s[2,1,1])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: s[2, 1, 1] is not in the image

    The `k`-Schur functions are more generally defined with a parameter `t` and they are
    a basis of the subspace spanned by the Hall-Littlewood ``Qp`` symmetric functions
    indexed by partitions whose first part is less than or equal to `k`::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t'].fraction_field())
        sage: SymS3 = Sym.kBoundedSubspace(3) # default t='t'
        sage: ks = SymS3.kschur()
        sage: Qp = Sym.hall_littlewood().Qp()
        sage: ks(Qp[2,1,1,1])
        ks3[2, 1, 1, 1] + (t^2+t)*ks3[2, 2, 1] + (t^3+t^2)*ks3[3, 1, 1] + t^4*ks3[3, 2]

    The subspace spanned by the `k`-Schur functions with a parameter `t` are not known
    to form a natural algebra.  However it is known that the product of a `k`-Schur
    function and an `\ell`-Schur function is in the linear span of the `k+\ell`-Schur
    functions::

        sage: ks(ks[2,1]*ks[1,1])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: s[2, 1, 1, 1] + s[2, 2, 1] + s[3, 1, 1] + s[3, 2] is not in the image
        sage: ks[2,1]*ks[1,1]
        s[2, 1, 1, 1] + s[2, 2, 1] + s[3, 1, 1] + s[3, 2]
        sage: ks6 = Sym.kBoundedSubspace(6).kschur()
        sage: ks6(ks[3,1,1]*ks[3])
        ks6[3, 3, 1, 1] + ks6[4, 2, 1, 1] + (t+1)*ks6[4, 3, 1] + t*ks6[4, 4]
        + ks6[5, 1, 1, 1] + ks6[5, 2, 1] + t*ks6[5, 3] + ks6[6, 1, 1]

    The `k`-split basis is a second basis of the ring spanned by the `k`-Schur
    functions with a parameter `t`.  The `k`-split basis has the property that
    `Q'_\lambda[X;t]` expands positively in the `k`-split basis and the
    `k`-split basis conjecturally expands positively in the `k`-Schur functions.
    The definition can be found in [LLMSSZ]_ p. 81.::

        sage: ksp3 = SymS3.ksplit()
        sage: ksp3(Qp[2,1,1,1])
        ksp3[2, 1, 1, 1] + t^2*ksp3[2, 2, 1] + (t^3+t^2)*ksp3[3, 1, 1] + t^4*ksp3[3, 2]
        sage: [ks(ksp3(la)) for la in sorted(ksp3(Qp[2,1,1,1]).support())]
        [ks3[2, 1, 1, 1] + t*ks3[2, 2, 1], ks3[2, 2, 1], ks3[3, 1, 1], ks3[3, 2]]

    .. rubric:: dual `k`-Schur functions

    The dual space to the subspace spanned by the `k`-Schur functions is most naturally
    realized as a quotient of the ring of symmetric functions by an ideal.  When `t=1`
    the ideal is generated by the monomial symmetric functions indexed by partitions
    whose first part is greater than `k`.::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
        sage: SymQ3 = Sym.kBoundedQuotient(3,t=1)
        sage: km = SymQ3.kmonomial()
        sage: km[2,1]*km[2,1]
        4*m3[2, 2, 1, 1] + 6*m3[2, 2, 2] + 2*m3[3, 2, 1] + 2*m3[3, 3]
        sage: F = SymQ3.affineSchur()
        sage: F[2,1]*F[2,1]
        2*F3[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + 4*F3[2, 1, 1, 1, 1] + 4*F3[2, 2, 1, 1] + 4*F3[2, 2, 2]
        + 2*F3[3, 1, 1, 1] + 4*F3[3, 2, 1] + 2*F3[3, 3]

    When `t` is not equal to `1`, the subspace spanned by the `k`-Schur functions is
    realized as a quotient of the ring of symmetric functions by the ideal generated by
    the Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions in the P basis indexed by partitions with
    first part greater than `k`.::

        sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t']))
        sage: SymQ3 = Sym.kBoundedQuotient(3)
        sage: kHLP = SymQ3.kHallLittlewoodP()
        sage: kHLP[2,1]*kHLP[2,1]
        (t^2+2*t+1)*HLP3[2, 2, 1, 1] + (t^3+2*t^2+2*t+1)*HLP3[2, 2, 2]
        + (-t^4-t^3+t+1)*HLP3[3, 1, 1, 1] + (-t^2+t+2)*HLP3[3, 2, 1] + (t+1)*HLP3[3, 3]
        sage: HLP = Sym.hall_littlewood().P()
        sage: kHLP(HLP[3,1])
        HLP3[3, 1]
        sage: kHLP(HLP[4])
        0

    In this space, the basis which is dual to the `k`-Schur functions conjecturally
    expands positively in the `k`-bounded Hall-Littlewood functions and has positive
    structure coefficients.::

        sage: dks = SymQ3.dual_k_Schur()
        sage: kHLP(dks[2,2])
        (t^4+t^2)*HLP3[1, 1, 1, 1] + t*HLP3[2, 1, 1] + HLP3[2, 2]
        sage: dks[2,1]*dks[1,1]
        (t^2+t)*dks3[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + (t+1)*dks3[2, 1, 1, 1] + (t+1)*dks3[2, 2, 1]
        + dks3[3, 1, 1] + dks3[3, 2]

    At `t=1` the `k`-bounded Hall-Littlewood basis is equal to the `k`-bounded monomial
    basis and the dual `k`-Schur elements are equal to the affine Schur basis.  The
    `k`-bounded monomial basis and affine Schur functions are faster and should be used
    instead of the `k`-bounded Hall-Littlewood P basis and dual `k`-Schur functions when
    `t=1`.::

        sage: SymQ3 = Sym.kBoundedQuotient(3,t=1)
        sage: dks = SymQ3.dual_k_Schur()
        sage: F = SymQ3.affineSchur()
        sage: F[3,1]==dks[3,1]
        True

    .. rubric:: Implementing new bases

    In order to implement a new symmetric function basis, Sage will need
    to know at a minimum how to change back and forth between at least one
    other basis (although they do not necessarily have to be the same basis).
    All of the standard functions associated with the basis will have a
    default implementation (although a more specific implementation may
    be more efficient).

    To present an idea of how this is done, we will create
    here the example of how to implement the basis `s_\mu[X(1-t)]`.

    To begin, we import the class
    :class:`sage.combinat.sf.sfa.SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic()`.  Our
    new basis will inherit all of the default methods from this class::

        sage: from sage.combinat.sf.sfa import SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic as SFA_generic

    Now the basis we are creating has a parameter `t` which is possible
    to specialize. In this example we will convert to and from the Schur
    basis.  For this we implement methods ``_self_to_s`` and ``_s_to_self``.
    By registering these two functions as coercions, Sage then knows
    automatically how it possible to change between any two bases for
    which there is a path of changes of bases. ::

        sage: from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
        sage: class SFA_st(SFA_generic):
        ....:     def __init__(self, Sym, t):
        ....:         SFA_generic.__init__(self, Sym, basis_name=
        ....:           "Schur functions with a plethystic substitution of X -> X(1-t)",
        ....:           prefix='st')
        ....:         self._s = Sym.s()
        ....:         self.t = Sym.base_ring()(t)
        ....:         cat = HopfAlgebras(Sym.base_ring()).WithBasis()
        ....:         self.register_coercion(
        ....:           SetMorphism(Hom(self._s, self, cat), self._s_to_self))
        ....:         self._s.register_coercion(
        ....:           SetMorphism(Hom(self, self._s, cat), self._self_to_s))
        ....:     def _s_to_self(self, f):
        ....:         # f is a Schur function and the output is in the st basis
        ....:         return self._from_dict(f.theta_qt(0,self.t)._monomial_coefficients)
        ....:     def _self_to_s(self, f):
        ....:         # f is in the st basis and the output is in the Schur basis
        ....:         return self._s.sum(cmu*self._s(mu).theta_qt(self.t,0) for mu,cmu in f)
        ....:     class Element(SFA_generic.Element):
        ....:         pass

    An instance of this basis is created by calling it with a symmetric
    function ring ``Sym`` and a parameter ``t`` which is in the base ring
    of ``Sym``.  The ``Element`` class inherits all of the methods from
    :class:`sage.combinat.sf.sfa.SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_generic_Element`.

    In the reference [MAC]_ on page 354, this basis is denoted
    `S_\lambda(x;t)` and the change of basis coefficients of the
    Macdonald ``J`` basis are the coefficients `K_{\lambda\mu}(q,t)`.
    Here is an example of its use::

        sage: QQqt = QQ['q','t'].fraction_field()
        sage: (q,t) = QQqt.gens()
        sage: st = SFA_st(SymmetricFunctions(QQqt),t)
        sage: st
        Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial
         Ring in q, t over Rational Field in the Schur functions with a
         plethystic substitution of X -> X(1-t) basis
        sage: st[2,1] * st[1]
        st[2, 1, 1] + st[2, 2] + st[3, 1]
        sage: st([2]).coproduct()
        st[] # st[2] + st[1] # st[1] + st[2] # st[]
        sage: J = st.symmetric_function_ring().macdonald().J()
        sage: st(J[2,1])
        q*st[1, 1, 1] + (q*t+1)*st[2, 1] + t*st[3]
