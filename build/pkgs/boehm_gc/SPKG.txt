=== boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p1 (John Palmieri, Dec 2 2011) ===
 * #11883: fix upgrading from old versions of Sage.  This requires
   unsetting RM if it's set to 'rm'.

=== boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0 (John Palmieri, Sept 30 2011) ===
 * #11883: upgrade to version 7.2.alpha6: according to the web site, the
   previous version "is old enough that you are almost certainly better
   off going with the much more recent and only somewhat experimental
   version", namely 7.2.alpha6.

 * Apply a fix so it builds on OS X 10.7 Lion.  Fix taken from the
   repository
   https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/tree/master/src/atomic_ops/sysdeps/gcc,
   and is mentioned at
   http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.programming.garbage-collection.boehmgc/4675.
   (There must be a better description of these patches, but I haven't
   found it.)
