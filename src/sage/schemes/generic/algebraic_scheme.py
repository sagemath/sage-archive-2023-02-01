Algebraic schemes

An algebraic scheme is defined by a set of polynomials in some
suitable affine or projective coordinates. Possible ambient spaces are

  * Affine spaces (:class:`AffineSpace
    <sage.schemes.affine.affine_space.AffineSpace_generic>`),

  * Projective spaces (:class:`ProjectiveSpace
    <sage.schemes.projective.projective_space.ProjectiveSpace_ring>`), or

  * Toric varieties (:class:`ToricVariety
    <sage.schemes.toric.variety.ToricVariety_field>`).

Note that while projective spaces are of course toric varieties themselves,
they are implemented differently in Sage due to efficiency considerations.
You still can create a projective space as a toric variety if you wish.

In the following, we call the corresponding subschemes affine
algebraic schemes, projective algebraic schemes, or toric algebraic
schemes. In the future other ambient spaces, perhaps by means of
gluing relations, may be introduced.

Generally, polynomials `p_0, p_1, \dots, p_n` define an ideal
`I=\left<p_0, p_1, \dots, p_n\right>`. In the projective and toric case, the
polynomials (and, therefore, the ideal) must be homogeneous. The
associated subscheme `V(I)` of the ambient space is, roughly speaking,
the subset of the ambient space on which all polynomials vanish simultaneously.

.. WARNING::

    You should not construct algebraic scheme objects directly. Instead, use
    ``.subscheme()`` methods of ambient spaces. See below for examples.

EXAMPLES:

We first construct the ambient space, here the affine space `\QQ^2`::

    sage: A2 = AffineSpace(2, QQ, 'x, y')
    sage: A2.coordinate_ring().inject_variables()
    Defining x, y

Now we can write polynomial equations in the variables `x` and `y`. For
example, one equation cuts out a curve (a one-dimensional subscheme)::

    sage: V = A2.subscheme([x^2+y^2-1]); V
    Closed subscheme of Affine Space of dimension 2
    over Rational Field defined by:
      x^2 + y^2 - 1
    sage: V.dimension()
    1

Here is a more complicated example in a projective space::

    sage: P3 = ProjectiveSpace(3, QQ, 'x')
    sage: P3.inject_variables()
    Defining x0, x1, x2, x3
    sage: Q = matrix([[x0, x1, x2], [x1, x2, x3]]).minors(2); Q
    [-x1^2 + x0*x2, -x1*x2 + x0*x3, -x2^2 + x1*x3]
    sage: twisted_cubic = P3.subscheme(Q)
    sage: twisted_cubic
    Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 3
    over Rational Field defined by:
      -x1^2 + x0*x2,
      -x1*x2 + x0*x3,
      -x2^2 + x1*x3
    sage: twisted_cubic.dimension()
    1

Note that there are 3 equations in the 3-dimensional ambient space,
yet the subscheme is 1-dimensional. One can show that it is not
possible to eliminate any of the equations, that is, the twisted cubic
is **not** a complete intersection of two polynomial equations.

Let us look at one affine patch, for example the one where `x_0=1` ::

    sage: patch = twisted_cubic.affine_patch(0)
    sage: patch
    Closed subscheme of Affine Space of dimension 3
    over Rational Field defined by:
      -x1^2 + x2,
      -x1*x2 + x3,
      -x2^2 + x1*x3
    sage: patch.embedding_morphism()
    Scheme morphism:
      From: Closed subscheme of Affine Space of dimension 3
      over Rational Field defined by:
      -x1^2 + x2,
      -x1*x2 + x3,
      -x2^2 + x1*x3
      To:   Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 3
      over Rational Field defined by:
      x1^2 - x0*x2,
      x1*x2 - x0*x3,
      x2^2 - x1*x3
      Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x1, x2, x3) to
            (1 : x1 : x2 : x3)

            sage: X = P2.subscheme((x^2-y^2)*z)

        Note that `p=(1,1,0)` is a singular point of `X`. So the
        neighborhood of `p` is not just affine space. The
        :meth:`neighborhood` method returns a presentation of
        the neighborhood as a subscheme of an auxiliary 2-dimensional
        affine space::

            sage: nbhd.ambient_space()
            Affine Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field

        But its :meth:`embedding_morphism` is not into this auxiliary
        affine space, but the original subscheme `X`::

            sage: nbhd.embedding_morphism()
            Scheme morphism:

        Compute the Weil restriction of this variety over some extension
        field. If the field is a finite field, then this computes
        the Weil restriction to the prime subfield.

        A Weil restriction of scalars - denoted `Res_{L/k}` - is a
        functor which, for any finite extension of fields `L/k` and
        any algebraic variety `X` over `L`, produces another
        corresponding variety `Res_{L/k}(X)`, defined over `k`. It is
        useful for reducing questions about varieties over large
        fields to questions about more complicated varieties over
        smaller fields.

        This function does not compute this Weil restriction directly
        but computes on generating sets of polynomial ideals:

        Let `d` be the degree of the field extension `L/k`, let `a` a
        generator of `L/k` and `p` the minimal polynomial of
        `L/k`. Denote this ideal by `I`.

        Specifically, this function first maps each variable `x` to
        its representation over `k`: `\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a^i x_i`. Then
        each generator of `I` is evaluated over these representations
        and reduced modulo the minimal polynomial `p`. The result is
        interpreted as a univariate polynomial in `a` and its
        coefficients are the new generators of the returned ideal.

        If the input and the output ideals are radical, this is
        equivalent to the statement about algebraic varieties above.

        OUTPUT: Affine subscheme - the Weil restriction of ``self``.
