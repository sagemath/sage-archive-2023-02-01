== iconv ==

== Description ==
GNU libiconv is a library that is used to enable different
languages, with different characters to be handled properly.

For more details see http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

== License ==
GPL 3 and LGPL 3. So we can link against the library ok.

== SPKG Maintainers ==
 * David Kirkby

== Dependencies ==

 * None for the purposes of Sage, but in general gettext.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

  * spkg-install removes ALL files installed by iconv - man pages,
    docs, etc etc. If iconv gets updated, check these still
    remove all traces of iconv.

    The sizes of the docs and man pages is small, so they are not
    work removing from the package, as they potentially risk
    breaking the install.

== Changelog ==

=== iconv-1.13.1.p3 (David Kirkby, July 26th 2010) ===
 * Do not assume bash is in /bin, as it is not on HP-UX
   Instead use #!/usr/bin/env bash as suggested in the
   Sage deveopers guide.
 * Force install of iconv on HP-UX in addition to the
   two previous platforms this was installed on
   (Solaris and Cygwin)
 * Additionally force make-check to run on HP-UX
 * Change the format of the tests in spkg-install and
   spkg-check to be a little clearer.
 * Add a few extra comments.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p2 (John Palmieri, March 31st 2010) ===
 * spkg-check: only run 'make check' on Solaris and Cygwin.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p1 (William Stein, March 31st 2010) ===
 * Really ensure iconv spkg only does something on Solaris and Cygwin.
   In particular, don't delete old versions thus breaking everybody's
   upgrades.

=== iconv-1.13.1.p0 (David Kirkby, March 21st 2010) ===
 * #8567 Ensure iconv only builds on Solaris and Cygwin as
   having two copies of iconv causes problems on some Linux systems.


=== iconv-1.13.1 (David Kirkby, February 13th 2010) ===
 * #8191 First release of libiconv, needed for R on Solaris
   and probably for Cygwin too (see #7319)
