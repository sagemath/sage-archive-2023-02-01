   WizardAux and the shell script TestScript.

== Changelog ==

=== ntl-5.5.2.p3 (Volker Braun, July 10 2013) ===
 * #14692: Add spkg-src and track all files.

=== ntl-5.5.2.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, Jean-Pierre Flori, 6 June 2013) ===
 * #14692: Patch upstream to use `$(MAKE)` (instead of `make`) in the generated
   Makefile (and in two scripts called from the Makefile which in turn invoke
   `make`).  As a consequence, also some parts are now properly built in
   parallel if `make` was told to use multiple jobs.
 * Minor clean-up of `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`.
 * Refactor and rename patches.

=== ntl-5.5.2.p1 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 4 June 2013) ===
 * #2114: build NTL with gf2x support.

=== ntl-5.5.2.p0 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 7 August 2012) ===
 * #11635: use NTL libtool system for building and installing.

=== ntl-5.5.2 (Martin Raum, March 22nd 2011) ===
 * Update to ntl-5.5.2, update the patches for the new version.

=== ntl-5.4.2.p12 (Mike Hansen, May 25th 2010) ===
 * Rename libntl.dll to libntl.dll.a on Cygwin.  This is #9050.

=== ntl-5.4.2.p11 (Jaap Spies, January 28th 2010) ===
 * Added 64 bit support for Open Solaris x64
 * This is trac http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/8101
 * Removed Michael as maintainer

=== ntl-5.4.2.p10 (David Kirkby, January 12th 2010) ===
 * Change variables of comman commands like 'ln' from
   '$LN' to 'ln'. There is no point having these as variables

=== ntl-5.4.2.p9 (David Kirkby, July 9 2009) ===
 * Removed  "-Wl,-soname,lib`cat DIRNAME`.so" from a
   makefile when a shared library is made. The code is
   surprerous and causes problems if gcc 4.4.0 is used
   on Solaris 10 with the Sun linker.

   I've not made this patch Solaris-specific, as I do not believe
   the code should be there on any platform. Hence it needs testing
   on more than just Solaris.

=== ntl-5.4.2.p8 (Mike Hansen, June 20th, 2009) ===
 * Applied Peter Jeremy's FreeBSD fix at #5872.

=== ntl-5.4.2.p7 (Michael Abshoff, May 6th, 2009) ===

 * Disable the help switch in DoConfig (#5040)
 * reenable tuning on 64 bit PPC Linux since it works on the PS3 (#4978)

=== ntl-5.4.2.p4 (Michael Abshoff, July 21st, 2008) ===
