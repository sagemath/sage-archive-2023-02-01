== Description ==

PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast
computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number
theory, elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other
useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as
matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot
of transcendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to
allow for faster computations.

Originally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Université
Bordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim
Belabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.

== Build Notes ==

Here is how to build a new version of the PARI SAGE spkg:

  1) Get the latest stable source code from
           http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/download.html
     (NOTE -- just like last time, at some point the devel version will be
              the way to go, since that's where all the bug fixes are.
        The PARI stable/devel model is complicated.)

  2) Extract the above code and make it the directory src in the
     current directory.

  3) Type ./spkg-dist in the above directory.

  4) Extract the file galdata.tgz from
     http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/download.html
     in the directory pari-*/src/

Note from David Kirkby that could be relevant to building on Solaris:

Since pari is using -xarch=native, which implies -xarch=v8plusa on my
box, but I set -xarch=v8plus (without the last a), this probably means
there will be different types of object files and so they may not link
together.  Ick.  Feel free to tell me how to modify the configure
script.

I got around it by setting CFLAGS -xarch=v8plus myself, so they were
all the same. But it is not right. I have not looked at pari to see
exactly where it says native, but I would expect a grep to find it.

== Changelog ==

=== pari-2.3.3.p2 (Minh Van Nguyen, October 02nd, 2009) ===
 * Change optimization flag of src/config/get_cc from "-O3" to
   "-O1". This fixes a build issue on 32-bit Fedora 11. See ticket #7092.

=== pari-2.3.3.p1 (David Kirkby, June 30th, 2009)    ===
 * Change code in spkg-install which was supposed to add -fPIC on
   Solaris, to code that actually does add -fPIC on Solaris.
   Prior to this, PARI built fine on a Sun Blade 2000 without
   -fPIC, but failed on a Sun T5240 (hostname t2). I'm not
   entirely sure whether this is actually need on Solaris x86
   or not - GCC manual says SPARC (no mention of Solaris x86)
   but someone on comp.unxi.solaris reckons it should be on
   Solaris x86 too.

   Hopefully this issue can be resolved by the PAPI developers and
   so the hack removed later. I'll report it to the PAPI developers.

   Thanks are due to Marc Glisse marc.glisse@gmail.com
   whose reply to my query on comp.unix.solaris solved this.

 * Corrected a mis-spelling on my name written by someone else.

=== pari-2.3.3.p0 (Michael Abshoff, Feb. 18th, 2008) ===
 * apply Karim's hnf patch
 * add OSX 10.5 64 bit build support

=== pari-2.3.3 (William Stein) ===
 * upgrade to the 2.3.3 release

=== pari-2.3.2 ===

* 2007-10-31: (Carl Witty)
   disable runpath altogether; we want Sage to be relocatable.
   install gphelp, and required documentation source files.

* 2007-09-09: (Michael Abshoff)
   add -fPIC to DCLFLAGS on Linux PPC in src/config/get_dlcflags

* 2007-03-04: included Pablo De Napoli (denapo@gmail.com)'s
   improvement so PARI will build on systems with runpath support.
   See sage/runpath.txt for details.

* 2006-09-28: (William Stein and Justin Walker)
  Modified PARI build scripts so that they build the
  PARI *shared* library even under OS X, and on OS X intel
  they build the x86/gmp kernel.


* I took the standard PARI tarball, but ran the script spkg-dist on it
  to create this directory.  This script does various things to some
  of the PARI files to make them work better with SAGE, the most
  important being to replace calls to exit() with calls to abort().

* Also, I placed a directory "sage" in this directory with some files
  needed by spkg-install.

* This changed removed -- 09/28/2006
#* I changed a line of config/Makefile.SH to
#      DLLDFLAGS  = $DLLDFLAGS -mimpure-text


* Put the extra galois groups data files in the data/galdata subdirectory,
