Hyperbolicity

**Definition** :

    The hyperbolicity `\delta` of a graph `G` has been defined by Gromov
    [Gromov87]_ as follows (we give here the so-called 4-points condition):

      Let `a, b, c, d` be vertices of the graph, let `S_1`, `S_2` and `S_3` be
      defined by

      .. MATH::

          S_1 = dist(a, b) + dist(b, c)\\
          S_2 = dist(a, c) + dist(b, d)\\
          S_3 = dist(a, d) + dist(b, c)\\

      and let `M_1` and `M_2` be the two largest values among `S_1`, `S_2`, and
      `S_3`. We define `hyp(a, b, c, d) = M_1 - M_2`, and the hyperbolicity
      `\delta(G)` of the graph is the maximum of `hyp` over all possible
      4-tuples `(a, b, c, d)` divided by 2. That is, the graph is said
      `\delta`-hyperbolic when

      .. MATH::

          \delta(G) = \frac{1}{2}\max_{a,b,c,d\in V(G)}hyp(a, b, c, d)

      (note that `hyp(a, b, c, d)=0` whenever two elements among `a,b,c,d` are
      equal)

**Some known results** :

    - Trees and cliques are `0`-hyperbolic

    - `n\times n` grids are `n-1`-hyperbolic

    - Cycles are approximately `n/4`-hyperbolic

    - Chordal graphs are `\leq 1`-hyperbolic

    Besides, the hyperbolicity of a graph is the maximum over all its
    biconnected components.

**Algorithms and complexity** :

    The time complexity of the naive implementation (i.e. testing all 4-tuples)
    is `O( n^4 )`, and an algorithm with time complexity `O(n^{3.69})` has been
    proposed in [FIV12]_.  This remains very long for large-scale graphs, and
    much harder to implement.

    Several improvements over the naive algorithm have been proposed and are
    implemented in the current module.

    - Another upper bound on `hyp(a, b, c, d)` has been proved in [CCL15]_. It
      is used to design an algorithm with worse case time complexity in
      `O(n^4)` but that behaves much better in practice.

      Assume that `S_1 = dist(a, b) + dist(c, d)` is the largest sum among
      `S_1,S_2,S_3`. We have

      .. MATH::

          S_2 + S_3 =& dist(a, c) + dist(b, d) + dist(a, d) + dist(b, c)\\
          =& [ dist(a, c) + dist(b, c) ] + [ dist(a, d) + dist(b, d)]\\
          \geq &dist(a,b) + dist(a,b)\\
          \geq &2dist(a,b)\\

      Now, since `S_1` is the largest sum, we have

      .. MATH::

          hyp(a, b, c, d) =& S_1 - \max\{S_2, S_3\}\\
          \leq& S_1 - \frac{S_2+ S_3}{2}\\
          \leq& S_1 - dist(a, b)\\
          =& dist(c, d)\\

      We obtain similarly that `hyp(a, b, c, d) \leq dist(a, b)`. Consequently,
      in the implementation of the 'CCL' algorithm, we ensure that `S_1` is
      larger than `S_2` and `S_3` using an ordering of the pairs by decreasing
      lengths. Then, we use the best value `h` found so far to stop exploration
      as soon as `dist(a, b) \leq h`.

      The worst case time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n^4)`, but it
      performs very well in practice since it cuts the search space. This
      algorithm can be turned into an approximation algorithm since at any step
      of its execution we maintain an upper and a lower bound. We can thus stop
      execution as soon as a multiplicative approximation factor or an additive
      one is proven.

    - The notion of ''far-apart pairs'' has been introduced in [Soto11]_ to
      further reduce the number of 4-tuples to consider. We say that the pair
      `(a,b)` is far-apart if for every `w` in `V\setminus\{a,b\}` we have

      .. MATH::

          dist(w,a)+dist(a,b) > dist(w,b) \text{ and }dist(w,b)+dist(a,b) > dist(w,a)

      Determining the set of far-apart pairs can be done in time `O(nm)` using
      BFS. Now, it is proved in [Soto11]_ that there exists two far-apart pairs
      `(a,b)` and `(c,d)` satisfying `\delta(G) = hyp(a, b, c, d)/2`. For
      instance, the `n\times m`-grid has only two far-apart pairs, and so
      computing its hyperbolicity is immediate once the far-apart pairs are
      found. The 'CCL+FA' or 'CCL+' algorithm improves the 'CCL' algorithm
      since it uses far-apart pairs.

    - This algorithm was further improved in [BCCM15]_: instead of iterating
      twice over all pairs of vertices, in the "inner" loop, we cut several
      pairs by exploiting properties of the underlying graph.

TODO:

- Add exact methods for the hyperbolicity of chordal graphs

- Add method for partitioning the graph with clique separators

    Return the hyperbolicity of a graph.

    This method implements the exact and the approximate algorithms proposed in
    [BCCM15]_. See the module's documentation for more details.

    This method assumes that the graph under consideration is connected.

    INPUT:

    - ``N`` -- number of vertices of the graph

    - ``distances`` -- path distance matrix

    - ``far_apart_pairs`` -- 0/1 matrix of far-apart pairs. Pair ``(i,j)`` is
      far-apart if ``far_apart_pairs[i][j]\neq 0``.

    - ``D`` -- diameter of the graph

    - ``h_LB`` -- lower bound on the hyperbolicity

    - ``approximation_factor`` -- When the approximation factor is set to some
      value larger than 1.0, the function stop computations as soon as the
      ratio between the upper bound and the best found solution is less than
      the approximation factor. When the approximation factor is 1.0, the
      problem is solved optimaly.

     - ``additive_gap`` -- When sets to a positive number, the function stop
       computations as soon as the difference between the upper bound and the
       best found solution is less than additive gap. When the gap is 0.0, the
       problem is solved optimaly.

    - ``verbose`` -- (default: ``False``) is boolean set to ``True`` to display
      some information during execution

    OUTPUTS:

    This function returns a tuple ( h, certificate, h_UB ), where:

    - ``h`` -- is an integer. When 4-tuples with hyperbolicity larger or equal
     to `h_LB are found, h is the maximum computed value and so twice the
     hyperbolicity of the graph. If no such 4-tuple is found, it returns -1.

    - ``certificate`` -- is a list of vertices. When 4-tuples with
      hyperbolicity larger that h_LB are found, certificate is the list of the
      4 vertices for which the maximum value (and so the hyperbolicity of the
      graph) has been computed. If no such 4-tuple is found, it returns the
      empty list [].

    - ``h_UB`` -- is an integer equal to the proven upper bound for `h`. When
      ``h == h_UB``, the returned solution is optimal.

    Returns the hyperbolicity of the graph or an approximation of this value.

    The hyperbolicity of a graph has been defined by Gromov [Gromov87]_ as
    follows: Let `a, b, c, d` be vertices of the graph, let `S_1 = dist(a, b) +
    dist(b, c)`, `S_2 = dist(a, c) + dist(b, d)`, and `S_3 = dist(a, d) +
    dist(b, c)`, and let `M_1` and `M_2` be the two largest values among `S_1`,
    `S_2`, and `S_3`. We have `hyp(a, b, c, d) = |M_1 - M_2|`, and the
    hyperbolicity of the graph is the maximum over all possible 4-tuples `(a,b,
    c,d)` divided by 2. The worst case time complexity is in `O( n^4 )`.

    See the documentation of :mod:`sage.graphs.hyperbolicity` for more
    information.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a connected Graph

    - ``algorithm`` -- (default: ``'BCCM'``) specifies the algorithm to use
      among:

          - ``'basic'`` is an exhaustive algorithm considering all possible
            4-tuples and so have time complexity in `O(n^4)`.

          - ``'CCL'`` is an exact algorithm proposed in [CCL15_]. It considers
            the 4-tuples in an ordering allowing to cut the search space as soon
            as a new lower bound is found (see the module's documentation). This
            algorithm can be turned into a approximation algorithm.

          - ``'CCL+FA'`` or ``'CCL+'`` uses the notion of far-apart pairs as
            proposed in [Soto11]_ to significantly reduce the overall
            computation time of the ``'CCL'`` algorithm.

          - ``'BCCM'`` is an exact algorithm proposed in [BCCM15_]. It improves
            ``'CCL+FA'`` by cutting several 4-tuples (for more information,
            see the module's documentation).

          - ``'dom'`` is an approximation with additive constant four. It
            computes the hyperbolicity of the vertices of a dominating set of
            the graph. This is sometimes slower than ``'CCL'`` and sometimes
            faster. Try it to know if it is interesting for you.
            The ``additive_gap`` and ``approximation_factor`` parameters cannot
            be used in combination with this method and so are ignored.

    - ``approximation_factor`` -- (default: None) When the approximation factor
      is set to some value (larger than 1.0), the function stop computations as
      soon as the ratio between the upper bound and the best found solution is
      less than the approximation factor. When the approximation factor is 1.0,
      the problem is solved optimaly. This parameter is used only when the
      chosen algorithm is ``'CCL'``, ``'CCL+FA'``, or ``'BCCM'``.

    - ``additive_gap`` -- (default: None) When sets to a positive number, the
      function stop computations as soon as the difference between the upper
      bound and the best found solution is less than additive gap. When the gap
      is 0.0, the problem is solved optimaly. This parameter is used only when
      the chosen algorithm is ``'CCL'`` or ``'CCL+FA'``, or ``'BCCM'``.

    - ``verbose`` -- (default: ``False``) is a boolean set to True to display
      some information during execution: new upper and lower bounds, etc.

    OUTPUT:

    This function returns the tuple ( delta, certificate, delta_UB ), where:

    - ``delta`` -- the hyperbolicity of the graph (half-integer value).

    - ``certificate`` -- is the list of the 4 vertices for which the maximum
      value has been computed, and so the hyperbolicity of the graph.

    - ``delta_UB`` -- is an upper bound for ``delta``. When ``delta ==
      delta_UB``, the returned solution is optimal. Otherwise, the approximation
      factor if ``delta_UB/delta``.
