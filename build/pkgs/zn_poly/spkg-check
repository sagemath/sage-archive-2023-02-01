# The methods for testing zn_poly are more complex than most other packages.
# A 'make check' does some quick tests. These are run from spkg-install
# to check zn_poly is not obviously disfunctional

# However, a more comprehensive set of tests can be run
# by first building a test program, then running that test program.

# To quote from the file src/README
#
# make check
#    Runs some quick tests to make sure that everything appears to be working.

# make test
#    Builds a test program. Running "test/test all" runs the whole zn_poly test
#    suite, which tests zn_poly much more thoroughly than "make check".

make test  #  Make sure the test program is built
