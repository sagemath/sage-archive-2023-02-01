= Jean Michel's GAP 3 distribution =

== Description ==

This package installs Jean Michel's pre-packaged GAP3, which is a minimal GAP3
distribution containing packages that have no equivalent in GAP4.

Below is the full description from Jean Michel's webpage
(accessed 23 July 2015).

    A pre-packaged GAP3 with everything you need

    To help people who are just interested in GAP3 because they need a package
    which has not been ported to GAP4, I have prepared an easy-to install
    minimal GAP3 distribution containing an up-to-date versions of the
    packages:

        anusq, arep, autag, chevie, cryst, dce, grim, matrix, meataxe, monoid,
        nq, pcqa, sisyphos, specht, ve, vkcurve.

    These packages have been chosen since most have no equivalent in GAP4. They
    are autoloaded when starting gap.

    This distribution includes only partial lists of small groups, 2-groups,
    3-groups, character tables from the Atlas and tables of marks. It does not
    include either the packages:

        anupq, grape, kbmag, xgap, cohomolo, gliss, guava, xmod

    which have some equivalent in GAP4. You can get these extra features at

        http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/gap/GAP3

    In this distribution:

    - The on-line help includes the documentation of the included packages.
    - The html documentation (htm/index.html) also does.
    - The manual (manual.pdf) also does.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

The difference between the distributed tarball and Jean Michel's
original tarball is that all binary files have been deleted one by one
from the listing obtained by

    grep -r -m 1 "^"  . | grep "^Binary file"
