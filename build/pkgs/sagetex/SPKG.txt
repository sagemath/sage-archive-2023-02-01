== Dependencies ==

To install, nothing more than a standard Sage install. The
`spkg-check` script will exit without actually testing anything if
it cannot find "latex" in your path.

== Notes ==

To use SageTeX, both Sage and LaTeX need to know about it. SageTeX comes
standard with Sage, so you only need to make sure LaTeX can find what it
needs. Full details are in the Sage installation guide at
http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/ and
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html .

The directory `$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/sagetex` contains
documentation and an example file. See
`$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex` for the source code and
some possibly useful scripts. If you have problems or suggestions see
[[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|the sage-support group]].

If you want to help develop SageTeX, please clone the github
repository (see the "Upstream Contact" above) and send me
patches based on that.
