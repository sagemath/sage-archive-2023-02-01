  determinant is computed even for rings for which the ``is_field`` method is not
  implemented.

- Rob Beezer (2011-02-05): refactored all of the matrix kernel routines; added
  ``extended_echelon_form``, ``right_kernel_matrix``, ``QR``,
  ``_gram_schmidt_noscale``, ``is_similar`` methods

        will be returned in any case. Over exact rings, on the other
        hand, setting the ``check`` parameter results in an additional
        test to determine whether or not the answer actually solves the
        system exactly.

        If `B` is a vector, the result is returned as a vector, as well,

        If `A` is a non-square matrix, the result is a least-squares solution.
        For a tall matrix, this may give a solution with a least-squares error
        of almost zero::

        will be returned in any case. Over exact rings, on the other
        hand, setting the ``check`` parameter results in an additional
        test to determine whether or not the answer actually solves the
        system exactly.

        If `B` is a vector, the result is returned as a vector, as well,
        and as a matrix, otherwise.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ, 3, [1,2,3,-1,2,5,2,3,1])
            sage: b = vector(QQ,[1,2,3])
            sage: x = A \ b; x
            (-13/12, 23/12, -7/12)
            sage: A * x
            (1, 2, 3)

        We solve with A nonsquare::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ,2,4, [0, -1, 1, 0, -2, 2, 1, 0]); B = matrix(QQ,2,2, [1, 0, 1, -1])

            [   0    0]
            [   0    0]
            sage: A*X == B
            True

        Another nonsingular example::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ,2,3, [1,2,3,2,4,6]); v = vector([-1/2,-1])
            sage: x = A \ v; x
            (-1/2, 0, 0)
            sage: A*x == v
            True

        Same example but over `\ZZ`::

            sage: A \ v
            (-1, 0, 0)

        An example in which there is no solution::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ,2,3, [1,2,3,2,4,6]); v = vector([1,1])
            sage: A \ v
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: matrix equation has no solutions

        A ValueError is raised if the input is invalid::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ,4,2, [0, -1, 1, 0, -2, 2, 1, 0])
            sage: B = matrix(QQ,2,2, [1, 0, 1, -1])
            sage: X = A.solve_right(B)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: number of rows of self must equal number of rows of
            right-hand side

        We solve with A singular::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ,2,3, [1,2,3,2,4,6]); B = matrix(QQ,2,2, [6, -6, 12, -12])
            sage: X = A.solve_right(B); X
            [ 6 -6]
            [ 0  0]
            [ 0  0]
            sage: A*X == B
            True

        Over inexact rings, the output of this function may not be an exact

            sage: abs(A*x - b) < 1e-14
            True

        If ``b`` is given as a matrix, the result will be a matrix, as well::

            sage: A = matrix(RDF, 3, 3, [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 2])
            sage: b = matrix(RDF, 3, 2, [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2])

            [ 4.5  3.0]
            [-3.0 -2.0]

        If `A` is a non-square matrix, the result is a least-squares solution.
        For a wide matrix, this may give a solution with a least-squares error
        of almost zero::

            sage: A = matrix(RDF, 2, 3, [1, 3, 4, 2, 0, -3])
            sage: b = vector(RDF, [5, 6])

            sage: (A * x - b).norm() < 1e-14
            True

        For a tall matrix `A`, the error is usually not small::

            sage: A = matrix(RDF, 3, 2, [1, 3, 4, 2, 0, -3])
            sage: b = vector(RDF, [5, 6, 1])

        Implementation for dense and sparse matrices are

        they are working identically. ::

    def permanent(self, algorithm="Ryser"):
        r"""
        Return the permanent of this matrix.

        Let `A = (a_{i,j})` be an `m \times n` matrix over any
        commutative ring with `m \le n`. The permanent of `A` is

        .. MATH::

           \mathrm{per}(A)
           = \sum_\pi a_{1,\pi(1)} a_{2,\pi(2)} \cdots a_{m,\pi(m)}

        where the summation extends over all one-to-one functions
        `\pi` from `\{1, \ldots, m\}` to `\{1, \ldots, n\}`.

        The product
        `a_{1,\pi(1)} a_{2,\pi(2)} \cdots a_{m,\pi(m)}` is
        called *diagonal product*. So the permanent of an
        `m \times n` matrix `A` is the sum of all the
        diagonal products of `A`.

        By default, this method uses Ryser's algorithm, but setting
        ``algorithm`` to "ButeraPernici" you can use the algorithm of Butera and
        Pernici (which is well suited for band matrices, i.e. matrices whose
        entries are concentrated near the diagonal).

        INPUT:

        - ``A`` -- matrix of size `m \times n` with `m \leq n`

        - ``algorithm`` -- either "Ryser" (default) or "ButeraPernici". The
          Butera-Pernici algorithm takes advantage of presence of zeros and is
          very well suited for sparse matrices.

        ALGORITHM:

        The Ryser algorithm is implemented in the method
        :meth:`_permanent_ryser`. It is a modification of theorem 7.1.1. from
        Brualdi and Ryser: Combinatorial Matrix Theory. Instead of deleting
        columns from `A`, we choose columns from `A` and calculate the product
        of the row sums of the selected submatrix.

        The Butera-Pernici algorithm is implemented in the function
        :func:`~sage.matrix.matrix_misc.permanental_minor_polynomial`. It takes
        advantage of cancellations that may occur in the computations.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: A = ones_matrix(4,4)
            sage: A.permanent()
            24

            sage: B.permanent()
            36.0000000000000

        The permanent above is directed to the Sloane's sequence :oeis:`A079908`
        ("The Dancing School Problems") for which the third term is 36:

        r"""
        Return the permanental `k`-minor of this matrix.

        The *permanental* `k`-*minor* of a matrix `A` is the sum of the
        permanents of all possible `k` by `k` submatrices of `A`. Note that the
        maximal permanental minor is just the permanent.

        For a (0,1)-matrix `A` the permanental `k`-minor
        counts the number of different selections of `k` 1's of
        `A` with no two of the 1's on the same row and no two of the
        1's on the same column.

        See Brualdi and Ryser: Combinatorial Matrix Theory, p. 203. Note
        the typo `p_0(A) = 0` in that reference! For applications
        see Theorem 7.2.1 and Theorem 7.2.4.

        Return the rook vector of this matrix.

        Let `A` be an `m` by `n` (0,1)-matrix. We identify `A` with a chessboard
        where rooks can be placed on the fields `(i, j)` with `A_{i,j} = 1`. The
        number `r_k = p_k(A)` (the permanental `k`-minor) counts the number of
        ways to place `k` rooks on this board so that no rook can attack
        another.

        The *rook vector* of the matrix `A` is the list consisting of `r_0,
        r_1, \ldots, r_h`, where `h = min(m,n)`. The *rook polynomial* is defined by
        `r(x) = \sum_{k=0}^h r_k x^k`.

        The rook vector can be generalized to matrices defined over any rings
        using permanental minors. Among the available algorithms, only "Godsil"
        needs the condition on the entries to be either `0` or `1`.

        See :wikipedia:`Rook_polynomial` for more information and also the

          simple and small instances. Godsil only accepts input in 0,1.

        - ``complement`` -- boolean (default: ``False``) whether we consider the
          rook vector of the complement matrix. If set to ``True`` then the
          matrix must have entries in {0, 1} and the complement matrix is the

        An other example that we convert into a rook polynomial::

            sage: A

            [0 1 1 1 1 0]
            [0 0 1 1 1 1]
            sage: A.rook_vector()
            [1, 12, 40, 36]

            sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
            sage: R(A.rook_vector())
            36*x^3 + 40*x^2 + 12*x + 1

        Different algorithms are available::

            sage: A = matrix([[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1]])
            sage: A.rook_vector(algorithm="ButeraPernici")

            sage: A.rook_vector(algorithm="Ryser")

            sage: A.rook_vector(algorithm="Godsil")
            [1, 8, 20, 16, 4]

        When the matrix `A` has more ones then zeroes it is usually faster
        to compute the rook polynomial of the complementary matrix, with
        zeroes and ones interchanged, and use the inclusion-exclusion theorem,
        giving for a `m \times n` matrix `A` with complementary matrix `B`

        .. MATH::

            r_k(A) = \sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \binom{m-j}{k-j} \binom{n-j}{k-j} (k-j)! r_j(B)

        see [Rio1958]_ or the introductory text [AS2011]_. This can be done
        setting the argument ``use_complement`` to ``True``.

        ALGORITHM:

        If the base ring has a method :meth:`_matrix_determinant`, we call it.

        Otherwise, for small matrices (n less than 4), this is computed using the
        naive formula. In the specific case of matrices over the integers modulo a
        non-prime, the determinant of a lift is computed over the integers.
        In general, the characteristic polynomial is computed either using
        the Hessenberg form (specified by ``"hessenberg"``) or the generic
        division-free algorithm (specified by ``"df"``).  When the base ring
        is an exact field, the default choice is ``"hessenberg"``, otherwise
        it is ``"df"``.  Note that for matrices over most rings, more
        sophisticated algorithms can be used. (Type ``A.determinant?`` to
        see what is done for a specific matrix ``A``.)

    def pfaffian(self, algorithm=None, check=True):
        r"""
        Return the Pfaffian of ``self``, assuming that ``self`` is an
        alternating matrix.

        The result is cached.

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` (default: ``None``) -- string, the algorithm to use;
          currently the following algorithms have been implemented:

          * ``'bfl'`` - using the Bär-Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm
          * ``'definition'`` - using the definition given by perfect
            matchings

        - ``check`` (default: ``True``) -- boolean determining whether to
          check ``self`` for alternatingness and squareness. This has to
          be set to ``False`` if ``self`` is defined over a non-discrete
          ring.

        The Pfaffian of an alternating matrix is defined as follows:

        Let `A` be an alternating `k \times k` matrix over a commutative
        ring. (Here, "alternating" means that `A^T = -A` and that the
        diagonal entries of `A` are zero.)
        If `k` is odd, then the Pfaffian of the matrix `A` is
        defined to be `0`. Let us now define it when `k` is even. In this
        case, set `n = k/2` (this is an integer). For every `i` and `j`,
        we denote the `(i, j)`-th entry of `A` by `a_{i, j}`. Let `M`
        denote the set of all perfect matchings of the set
        `\{ 1, 2, \ldots, 2n \}` (see
        :class:`sage.combinat.perfect_matching.PerfectMatchings` ).
        For every matching `m \in M`, define the sign `\mathrm{sign}(m)`
        of `m` by writing `m` as `\{ \{ i_1, j_1 \}, \{ i_2, j_2 \},
        \ldots, \{ i_n, j_n \} \}` with `i_k < j_k` for all `k`, and
        setting `\mathrm{sign}(m)` to be the sign of the permutation
        `( i_1, j_1, i_2, j_2, \ldots, i_n, j_n )` (written here in
        one-line notation). For every matching `m \in M`, define the
        weight `w(m)` of `m` by writing `m` as
        `\{ \{ i_1, j_1 \}, \{ i_2, j_2 \}, \ldots, \{ i_n, j_n \} \}`
        with `i_k < j_k` for all `k`, and setting
        `w(m) = a_{i_1, j_1} a_{i_2, j_2} \cdots a_{i_n, j_n}`. Now, the
        Pfaffian of the matrix `A` is defined to be the sum

        .. MATH::

            \sum_{m \in M} \mathrm{sign}(m) w(m).

        The Pfaffian of `A` is commonly denoted by `\mathrm{Pf}(A)`. It
        is well-known that `(\mathrm{Pf}(A))^2 = \det A` for every
        alternating matrix `A`, and that
        `\mathrm{Pf} (U^T A U) = \det U \cdot \mathrm{Pf}(A)` for any
        `n \times n` matrix `U` and any alternating `n \times n`
        matrix `A`.

        See [Knu1995]_, [DW1995]_ and [Rot2001]_, [Baer2020]_, just to name a
        few sources, for further properties of Pfaffians.

        ALGORITHM:

        If the matrix is small, namely up to size `4 \times 4`, the naive
        formulas are always used.

        The Bär-Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm can be accessed using ``'bfl'``.
        It works over any `\QQ`-algebra or ring whose fraction field is an
        `\QQ`-algebra (see [Baer2020]_ for details). If that check fails,
        the implementation raises an error because correct results cannot be
        guaranteed.

        To access the algorithm using the above defintion, use ``'definition'``.
        However, notice that this algorithm is usually very slow.

        By default, i.e. if no options are set, the implementation tries to
        apply the BFL algorithm first. If BFL is not applicable, it uses the
        definition by perfect matchings.

        The alternatingness of the matrix ``self`` is checked only if ``check``
        is ``True`` (this is important because even if ``self`` is alternating,
        a non-discrete base ring might prevent Sage from being able to check
        this).

        EXAMPLES:

        A `3 \times 3` alternating matrix has Pfaffian 0 independently
        of its entries::

            sage: MSp = MatrixSpace(Integers(27), 3)
            sage: A = MSp([0, 2, -3,  -2, 0, 8,  3, -8, 0])
            sage: A.pfaffian()
            0
            sage: parent(A.pfaffian())
            Ring of integers modulo 27

        The Pfaffian of a `2 \times 2` alternating matrix is just its
        northeast entry::

            sage: MSp = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2)
            sage: A = MSp([0, 4,  -4, 0])
            sage: A.pfaffian()
            4
            sage: parent(A.pfaffian())
            Rational Field

        The Pfaffian of a `0 \times 0` alternating matrix is `1`::

            sage: MSp = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 0)
            sage: A = MSp([])
            sage: A.pfaffian()
            1
            sage: parent(A.pfaffian())
            Integer Ring

        Let us compute the Pfaffian of a generic `4 \times 4` alternating
        matrix::

            sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x12,x13,x14,x23,x24,x34')
            sage: x12, x13, x14, x23, x24, x34 = R.gens()
            sage: A = matrix(R, [[   0,  x12,  x13,  x14],
            ....:                [-x12,    0,  x23,  x24],
            ....:                [-x13, -x23,    0,  x34],
            ....:                [-x14, -x24, -x34,    0]])
            sage: A.pfaffian()
            x14*x23 - x13*x24 + x12*x34
            sage: parent(A.pfaffian())
            Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x12, x13, x14, x23, x24, x34 over Rational Field

        The Pfaffian of an alternating matrix squares to its
        determinant::

            sage: A = [[0] * 6 for i in range(6)]
            sage: for i in range(6):
            ....:     for j in range(i):
            ....:         u = floor(random() * 10)
            ....:         A[i][j] = u
            ....:         A[j][i] = -u
            ....:     A[i][i] = 0
            sage: AA = Matrix(ZZ, A)
            sage: AA.pfaffian() ** 2 == AA.det()
            True

        In order to use the Bär-Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm, the base ring
        must have characteristic zero::

            sage: A = matrix(GF(5), [(0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4),
            ....:                    (2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0),

    def charpoly(self, var = 'x', algorithm = None):
        r"""
        Returns the characteristic polynomial of self, as a polynomial over
        the base ring.

        ALGORITHM:

        If the base ring has a method `_matrix_charpoly`, we use it.

        In the generic case of matrices over a ring (commutative and with
        unity), there is a division-free algorithm, which can be accessed
        using ``"df"``, with complexity `O(n^4)`.  Alternatively, by
        specifying ``"hessenberg"``, this method computes the Hessenberg
        form of the matrix and then reads off the characteristic polynomial.
        Moreover, for matrices over number fields, this method can use
        PARI's charpoly implementation instead.

        The method's logic is as follows:  If no algorithm is specified,
        first check if the base ring is a number field (and then use PARI),
        otherwise check if the base ring is the ring of integers modulo n (in
        which case compute the characteristic polynomial of a lift of the
        matrix to the integers, and then coerce back to the base), next check
        if the base ring is an exact field (and then use the Hessenberg form),
        or otherwise, use the generic division-free algorithm.
        If an algorithm is specified explicitly, if
        ``algorithm == "hessenberg"``, use the Hessenberg form, or otherwise
        use the generic division-free algorithm.

        The result is cached.

        INPUT:

        - ``var`` - a variable name (default: 'x')
        - ``algorithm`` - string:
            - ``"df"`` - Generic `O(n^4)` division-free algorithm
            - ``"hessenberg"`` - Use the Hessenberg form of the matrix

        EXAMPLES:

        First a matrix over `\ZZ`::

            sage: A = MatrixSpace(ZZ,2)( [1,2,  3,4] )
            sage: f = A.charpoly('x')
            sage: f
            x^2 - 5*x - 2
            sage: f.parent()
            Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
            sage: f(A)
            [0 0]
            [0 0]

        An example over `\QQ`::

            sage: A = MatrixSpace(QQ,3)(range(9))
            sage: A.charpoly('x')
            x^3 - 12*x^2 - 18*x
            sage: A.trace()
            12
            sage: A.determinant()
            0

        We compute the characteristic polynomial of a matrix over the
        polynomial ring `\ZZ[a]`::

            sage: R.<a> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
            sage: M = MatrixSpace(R,2)([a,1,  a,a+1]); M
            [    a     1]
            [    a a + 1]
            sage: f = M.charpoly('x'); f
            x^2 + (-2*a - 1)*x + a^2
            sage: f.parent()
            Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Integer Ring
            sage: M.trace()
            2*a + 1
            sage: M.determinant()
            a^2

        We compute the characteristic polynomial of a matrix over the
        multi-variate polynomial ring `\ZZ[x,y]`::

            sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,2)
            sage: A = MatrixSpace(R,2)([x, y, x^2, y^2])
            sage: f = A.charpoly('x'); f
            x^2 + (-y^2 - x)*x - x^2*y + x*y^2

        It's a little difficult to distinguish the variables. To fix this,
        we temporarily view the indeterminate as `Z`::

            sage: with localvars(f.parent(), 'Z'): print(f)
            Z^2 + (-y^2 - x)*Z - x^2*y + x*y^2

        We could also compute f in terms of Z from the start::

            sage: A.charpoly('Z')
            Z^2 + (-y^2 - x)*Z - x^2*y + x*y^2

        Here is an example over a number field::

            sage: x = QQ['x'].gen()
            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
            sage: m = matrix(K, [[a-1, 2], [a, a+1]])
            sage: m.charpoly('Z')
            Z^2 - 2*a*Z - 2*a + 1
            sage: m.charpoly('a')(m) == 0
            True

        Over integers modulo `n` with composite `n`::

            sage: A = Mat(Integers(6),3,3)(range(9))
            sage: A.charpoly()
            x^3

        Here is an example over a general commutative ring, that is to say,
        as of version 4.0.2, Sage does not even positively determine that
        ``S`` in the following example is an integral domain.  But the
        computation of the characteristic polynomial succeeds as follows::

            sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
            sage: S.<x,y> = R.quo((b^3))
            sage: A = matrix(S, [[x*y^2,2*x],[2,x^10*y]])
            sage: A
            [ x*y^2    2*x]
            [     2 x^10*y]
            sage: A.charpoly('T')
            T^2 + (-x^10*y - x*y^2)*T - 4*x

        TESTS::

            sage: P.<a,b,c> = PolynomialRing(Rationals())
            sage: u = MatrixSpace(P,3)([[0,0,a],[1,0,b],[0,1,c]])
            sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(P)
            sage: u.charpoly('x')
            x^3 - c*x^2 - b*x - a

        A test case from :trac:`6442`. Prior to :trac:`12292`, the
        call to ``A.det()`` would attempt to use the cached charpoly,
        and crash if an empty dictionary was cached. We don't cache
        dictionaries anymore, but this test should still pass::

            sage: z = Zp(p=5)
            sage: A = matrix(z, [ [3 + O(5^1), 4 + O(5^1), 4 + O(5^1)],
            ....:                 [2*5^2 + O(5^3), 2 + O(5^1), 1 + O(5^1)],
            ....:                 [5 + O(5^2), 1 + O(5^1), 1 + O(5^1)] ])
            sage: A.charpoly(algorithm='hessenberg')
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: negative valuation
            sage: A.det()
            3 + O(5)

        The cached polynomial should be independent of the ``var``
        argument (:trac:`12292`). We check (indirectly) that the
        second call uses the cached value by noting that its result is
        not cached::

        Computes the characteristic polynomial of ``self`` without divisions.

        INPUT:

        - ``var`` - a variable name (default: ``'x'``)

        OUTPUT:

        - polynomial -- the characteristic polynomial of ``self``

        EXAMPLES:

        Here is one easy example over the integers to illustrate this::

            sage: A = matrix(ZZ, [[1,24],[3,5]])
            sage: A
            [ 1 24]
            [ 3  5]
            sage: A._charpoly_df()
            x^2 - 6*x - 67

        The second example is a matrix over a univariate polynomial ring over the
        rationals::

            sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
            sage: A = matrix(R,[[7*t^2 - t - 9, -1/4*t - 1, -17*t^2 - t + 1],
            ....:               [-t^2 + 1/4*t, t^2 + 5/7*t + 3, 1/5*t^2 + 1662],
            ....:               [-2*t - 3, 2*t^2 + 6*t - 1/2, -1/6*t^2]])
            sage: A
            [    7*t^2 - t - 9        -1/4*t - 1   -17*t^2 - t + 1]
            [     -t^2 + 1/4*t   t^2 + 5/7*t + 3    1/5*t^2 + 1662]
            [         -2*t - 3 2*t^2 + 6*t - 1/2          -1/6*t^2]
            sage: A._charpoly_df()
            x^3 + (-47/6*t^2 + 2/7*t + 6)*x^2 + (79/15*t^4 - 13189/420*t^3 -
            1884709/560*t^2 - 279501/28*t + 807)*x - 901/30*t^6 - 423/8*t^5 +
            11218517/480*t^4 + 2797765/42*t^3 - 12987971/280*t^2 - 5235245/56*t + 2484

        Thirdly, an example over a ring which is not an integral domain::

            sage: A = matrix(ZZ.quo(12), 3, [5,8,0,10,2,1,8,7,9])
            sage: A
            [ 5  8  0]
            [10  2  1]
            [ 8  7  9]
            sage: A._charpoly_df()
            x^3 + 8*x^2 + 10*x + 1

        TESTS::

            sage: A = matrix(ZZ, 0, 0)
            sage: A
            []
            sage: A._charpoly_df()
            1

            sage: A = matrix(ZZ, 1, 1, [[23]])
            sage: A._charpoly_df()
            x - 23

        Test that :trac:`27937` is fixed::

            sage: R = FreeAbelianMonoid('u,v').algebra(QQ)
            sage: matrix(4, 4, lambda i, j: R.an_element())._charpoly_df()
            B[1]*x^4 - 4*B[u]*x^3

        .. NOTE::

            The key feature of this implementation is that it is division-free.
            This means that it can be used as a generic implementation for any
            ring (commutative and with multiplicative identity).  The algorithm
            is described in full detail as Algorithm 3.1 in [Sei2002]_.

            Note that there is a missing minus sign in front of the last term in
            the penultimate line of Algorithm 3.1.

        - ``algorithm`` - default: 'default' - a keyword that selects the
          algorithm employed.  Allowable values are:

          - 'default' - allows the algorithm to be chosen automatically
          - 'generic' - naive algorithm usable for matrices over any field
          - 'flint' - FLINT library code for matrices over the rationals
            or the integers
          - 'pari' - PARI library code for matrices over number fields
            or the integers
          - 'padic' - padic algorithm from IML library for matrices
            over the rationals and integers
          - 'pluq' - PLUQ matrix factorization for matrices mod 2

        - ``basis`` - default: 'echelon' - a keyword that describes
          the format of the basis returned.  Allowable values are:

          - 'echelon': the basis matrix is returned in echelon form
          - 'pivot' : each basis vector is computed from the reduced
            row-echelon form of ``self`` by placing a single one in a
            non-pivot column and zeros in the remaining non-pivot columns.
            Only available for matrices over fields.
          - 'LLL': an LLL-reduced basis.  Only available for matrices
            over the integers.
          - 'computed': no work is done to transform the basis, it is
            returned exactly as provided by whichever routine actually
            computed the basis.  Request this for the least possible
            computation possible, but with no guarantees about the format
            of the basis. This option is recommended for inexact rings.

        OUTPUT:

        A matrix ``X``  whose rows are an independent set spanning the
        right kernel of ``self``.  So ``self*X.transpose()`` is a zero matrix.

        The output varies depending on the choice of ``algorithm`` and the
        format chosen by ``basis``.

        The results of this routine are not cached, so you can call it again
        with different options to get possibly different output (like the basis
        format).  Conversely, repeated calls on the same matrix will always
        start from scratch.

        .. NOTE::

            If you want to get the most basic description of a kernel, with a
            minimum of overhead, then ask for the right kernel matrix with
            the basis format requested as 'computed'.  You are then free to
            work with the output for whatever purpose.  For a left kernel,
            call this method on the transpose of your matrix.

            For greater convenience, plus cached results, request an actual
            vector space or free module with :meth:`right_kernel`
            or :meth:`left_kernel`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Over the Rational Numbers:

        Kernels are computed by the IML library in
        :meth:`~sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense._right_kernel_matrix`.
        Setting the `algorithm` keyword to 'default', 'padic' or unspecified
        will yield the same result, as there is no optional behavior.
        The 'computed' format of the basis vectors are exactly the negatives
        of the vectors in the 'pivot' format. ::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[1, 0, 1, -3, 1],
            ....:                 [-5, 1, 0, 7, -3],

            sage: A*E.transpose() == zero_matrix(QQ, 4, 2)
            True

        Since the rationals are a field, we can call the general code
        available for any field by using the 'generic' keyword. ::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[1, 0, 1, -3, 1],
            ....:                 [-5, 1, 0, 7, -3],
            ....:                 [0, -1, -4, 6, -2],
            ....:                 [4, -1, 0, -6, 2]])
            sage: G = A.right_kernel_matrix(algorithm='generic', basis='echelon'); G
            [   1    0    1  1/2 -1/2]
            [   0    1 -1/2 -1/4 -1/4]
            sage: A*G.transpose() == zero_matrix(QQ, 4, 2)
            True

        We verify that the rational matrix code is called for both
        dense and sparse rational matrices, with equal result. ::

        Over Number Fields:

        Kernels are by default computed by PARI, (except for exceptions like
        the rationals themselves).  The raw results from PARI are a pivot
        basis, so the `basis` keywords 'computed' and 'pivot' will return
        the same results. ::

        We can bypass using PARI for number fields and use Sage's general
        code for matrices over any field.  The basis vectors as computed
        are in pivot format. ::

        We check that number fields are handled by the right routine as part of
        typical right kernel computation. ::

        Kernels are computed by the M4RI library using PLUQ matrix
        decomposition in the
        :meth:`~sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense.Matrix_mod2_dense._right_kernel_matrix`
        method. There are no options for the algorithm used.  ::

            True

        Since GF(2) is a field we can route this computation to the generic
        code and obtain the 'pivot' form of the basis.  The ``algorithm``
        keywords, 'pluq', 'default' and unspecified, all have the
        same effect as there is no optional behavior. ::

        This general code can be requested for matrices over any field
        with the ``algorithm`` keyword 'generic'.  Normally, matrices
        over the rationals would be handled by specific routines from
        the IML library. The default format is an echelon basis, but a
        pivot basis may be requested, which is identical to the computed
        basis. ::

        vectors.  The ``algorithm`` keyword can be used to select either,
        or when set to 'default' a heuristic will choose between the two.
        Results can be returned in the 'compute' format, straight out of
        the libraries.  Unique to the integers, the basis vectors can be
        returned as an LLL basis.  Note the similarities and differences

        Kernels can be computed using Smith normal form.  Only the default
        algorithm is available, and the 'pivot' basis format is
        not available. ::

        It can be computationally expensive to determine if an integral

            or the integers
          - 'padic' - padic algorithm from IML library for matrices
            over the rationals and integers
          - 'pluq' - PLUQ matrix factorization for matrices mod 2

        - ``basis`` - default: 'echelon' - a keyword that describes the
          format of the basis used to construct the right kernel.
          Allowable values are:

          - 'echelon': the basis matrix is returned in echelon form
          - 'pivot' : each basis vector is computed from the reduced
            row-echelon form of ``self`` by placing a single one in a
            non-pivot column and zeros in the remaining non-pivot columns.
            Only available for matrices over fields.
          - 'LLL': an LLL-reduced basis.  Only available for matrices
            over the integers.

        OUTPUT:

        A vector space or free module whose degree equals the number
        of columns in ``self`` and which contains all the vectors ``x``
        such that ``self*x = 0``.

        If ``self`` has 0 columns, the kernel has dimension 0, while if
        ``self`` has 0 rows the kernel is the entire ambient vector space.

        The result is cached.  Requesting the right kernel a second time,
        but with a different basis format, will return the cached result
        with the format from the first computation.

        .. NOTE::

           For more detailed documentation on the selection of algorithms
           used and a more flexible method for computing a basis matrix
           for a right kernel (rather than computing a vector space), see
           :meth:`right_kernel_matrix`, which powers the computations for
           this method.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[0, 0, 1, 2, 2, -5, 3],
            ....:                 [-1, 5, 2, 2, 1, -7, 5],

            ....:                 [-1, 5, 0, -1, -2, 1, 0]])
            sage: K = A.right_kernel(); K

            Basis matrix:
            [ 1  0  0  0 -1 -1 -1]

            [ 0  0  0  1  0  1  1]
            sage: A*K.basis_matrix().transpose() == zero_matrix(QQ, 4, 4)
            True

        The default is basis vectors that form a matrix in echelon form.
        A "pivot basis" instead has a basis matrix where the columns of
        an identity matrix are in the locations of the non-pivot columns
        of the original matrix. This alternate format is available whenever
        the base ring is a field. ::

        Matrices may have any field as a base ring.  Number fields are
        computed by PARI library code, matrices over `GF(2)` are computed
        by the M4RI library, and matrices over the rationals are computed by
        the IML library.  For any of these specialized cases, general-purpose
        code can be called instead with the keyword setting
        ``algorithm='generic'``.

        Over an arbitrary field, with two basis formats.  Same vector space,
        different bases.  ::

            sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(5^2)
            sage: A = matrix(F, 3, 4, [[  1,   a,     1+a,  a^3+a^5],
            ....:                      [  a, a^4,   a+a^4,  a^4+a^8],
            ....:                      [a^2, a^6, a^2+a^6, a^5+a^10]])

            sage: A*K.basis_matrix().transpose() == zero_matrix(F, 3, 2)
            True

        In the following test, we have to force usage of
        :class:`~sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense`,
        since the option ``basis = 'pivot'`` would simply yield the same
        result as the previous test, if the optional meataxe package is
        installed. ::

            sage: from sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense import Matrix_generic_dense

        If the optional meataxe package is installed, we again have to make sure
        to work with a copy of B that has the same type as ``P.basis_matrix()``::

            sage: B.parent()(B.list())*P.basis_matrix().transpose() == zero_matrix(F, 3, 2)
            True
            sage: K == P
            True

        Over number fields, PARI is used by default, but general-purpose code
        can be requested.  Same vector space, same bases, different code.::

        For matrices over the integers, several options are possible.
        The basis can be an LLL-reduced basis or an echelon basis.
        The pivot basis isnot available.  A heuristic will decide whether
        to use a p-adic algorithm from the IML library or an algorithm
        from the PARI library.  Note how specifying the algorithm can
        mildly influence the LLL basis. ::

        - ``algorithm`` - default: 'default' - a keyword that selects the
          algorithm employed.  Allowable values are:

          - 'default' - allows the algorithm to be chosen automatically
          - 'generic' - naive algorithm usable for matrices over any field
          - 'flint' - FLINT library code for matrices over the rationals
            or the integers
          - 'pari' - PARI library code for matrices over number fields
            or the integers
          - 'padic' - padic algorithm from IML library for matrices
            over the rationals and integers
          - 'pluq' - PLUQ matrix factorization for matrices mod 2

        - ``basis`` - default: 'echelon' - a keyword that describes
          the format of the basis used to construct the left kernel.
          Allowable values are:

          - 'echelon': the basis matrix is returned in echelon form
          - 'pivot' : each basis vector is computed from the reduced
            row-echelon form of ``self`` by placing a single one in a
            non-pivot column and zeros in the remaining non-pivot columns.
            Only available for matrices over fields.
          - 'LLL': an LLL-reduced basis.  Only available for matrices
            over the integers.

        OUTPUT:

        A vector space or free module whose degree equals the number
        of rows in ``self`` and which contains all the vectors ``x`` such
        that ``x*self = 0``.

        If ``self`` has 0 rows, the kernel has dimension 0, while if ``self``
        has 0 columns the kernel is the entire ambient vector space.

        The result is cached.  Requesting the left kernel a second time,
        but with a different basis format, will return the cached result
        with the format from the first computation.

        .. NOTE::

           For much more detailed documentation of the various options see
           :meth:`right_kernel`, since this method just computes
           the right kernel of the transpose of ``self``.

        for the basis is ignored and the cached copy is returned.

        are guaranteed to be sorted in the same way as the corresponding
        factors of the characteristic polynomial.

        Let A be the matrix acting from the on the vector space V of column
        vectors. Assume that A is square. This function computes maximal
        subspaces W_1, ..., W_n corresponding to Galois conjugacy classes
        of eigenvalues of A. More precisely, let `f(X)` be the characteristic
        polynomial of A. This function computes the subspace

           compute `ker(f_i(A))` for each factor `f_i`.

        -  ``dual`` - bool (default: False): If True, also
           returns the corresponding decomposition of V under the action of
           the transpose of A. The factors are guaranteed to correspond.

        -  ``is_diagonalizable`` - if the matrix is known to
           be diagonalizable, set this to True, which might speed up the
           algorithm in some cases.

           If the base ring is not a field, the kernel algorithm is
           used.

        are identical methods.  Here "left" refers to the eigenvectors
        being placed to the left of the matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a square matrix over an exact field.  For inexact
          matrices consult the numerical or symbolic matrix classes.

        - ``format`` - default: ``None``

          - ``'all'`` - attempts to create every eigenspace.  This will
            always be possible for matrices with rational entries.
          - ``'galois'`` - for each irreducible factor of the characteristic
            polynomial, a single eigenspace will be output for a
            single root/eigenvalue for the irreducible factor.
          - ``None`` - Uses the 'all' format if the base ring is contained
            in an algebraically closed field which is implemented.
            Otherwise, uses the 'galois' format.

        - ``var`` - default: 'a' - variable name used to
          represent elements of the root field of each
          irreducible factor of the characteristic polynomial.
          If var='a', then the root fields will be in terms of
          a0, a1, a2, ...., where the numbering runs across all
          the irreducible factors of the characteristic polynomial,
          even for linear factors.

        - ``algebraic_multiplicity`` - default: False - whether or
          not to include the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue
          in the output.  See the discussion below.

        OUTPUT:

        If algebraic_multiplicity=False, return a list of pairs (e, V)
        where e is an eigenvalue of the matrix, and V is the corresponding
        left eigenspace.  For Galois conjugates of eigenvalues, there
        may be just one representative eigenspace, depending on the
        ``format`` keyword.

        If algebraic_multiplicity=True, return a list of triples (e, V, n)
        where e and V are as above and n is the algebraic multiplicity of
        the eigenvalue.

        Compute the right eigenspaces of a matrix.

        Note that ``eigenspaces_right()`` and ``right_eigenspaces()``
        are identical methods.  Here "right" refers to the eigenvectors
        being placed to the right of the matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a square matrix over an exact field.  For inexact
          matrices consult the numerical or symbolic matrix classes.

        - ``format`` - default: ``None``

          - ``'all'`` - attempts to create every eigenspace.  This will
            always be possible for matrices with rational entries.
          - ``'galois'`` - for each irreducible factor of the characteristic
            polynomial, a single eigenspace will be output for a
            single root/eigenvalue for the irreducible factor.
          - ``None`` - Uses the 'all' format if the base ring is contained
            in an algebraically closed field which is implemented.
            Otherwise, uses the 'galois' format.

        - ``var`` - default: 'a' - variable name used to
          represent elements of the root field of each
          irreducible factor of the characteristic polynomial.
          If var='a', then the root fields will be in terms of
          a0, a1, a2, ...., where the numbering runs across all
          the irreducible factors of the characteristic polynomial,
          even for linear factors.

        - ``algebraic_multiplicity`` - default: False - whether or
          not to include the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue
          in the output.  See the discussion below.

        OUTPUT:

        If algebraic_multiplicity=False, return a list of pairs (e, V)
        where e is an eigenvalue of the matrix, and V is the corresponding
        left eigenspace.  For Galois conjugates of eigenvalues, there
        may be just one representative eigenspace, depending on the
        ``format`` keyword.

        If algebraic_multiplicity=True, return a list of triples (e, V, n)
        where e and V are as above and n is the algebraic multiplicity of
        the eigenvalue.

        .. warning::

           Uses a somewhat naive algorithm (simply factors the

           over the extension field).

    def rref(self, *args, **kwds):
        """
        Return the reduced row echelon form of the matrix, considered
        as a matrix over a field.

        If the matrix is over a ring, then an equivalent matrix is
        constructed over the fraction field, and then row reduced.

        All arguments are passed on to :meth:`echelon_form`.

        .. NOTE::

            Because the matrix is viewed as a matrix over a field,
            every leading coefficient of the returned matrix will be
            one and will be the only nonzero entry in its column.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: A=matrix(3,range(9)); A
            [0 1 2]
            [3 4 5]

            sage: A.rref()

            [ 0  1  2]
            [ 0  0  0]


        Note that there is a difference between :meth:`rref` and
        :meth:`echelon_form` when the matrix is not over a field (in
        this case, the integers instead of the rational numbers)::

            sage: A.base_ring()
            Integer Ring
            sage: A.echelon_form()
            [ 3  0 -3]
            [ 0  1  2]
            [ 0  0  0]

            sage: B = random_matrix(QQ, 3, num_bound=10)
            sage: while B.rank() != 3:
            ....:     B = random_matrix(QQ, 3, num_bound=10)
            sage: B.rref()
            [1 0 0]
            [0 1 0]
            [0 0 1]

        In this case, since ``B`` is a matrix over a field (the
        rational numbers), :meth:`rref` and :meth:`echelon_form` are
        exactly the same::

            sage: B.echelon_form()
            [1 0 0]
            [0 1 0]
            [0 0 1]
            sage: B.echelon_form() is B.rref()
            True

        Since :meth:`echelon_form` is not implemented for every ring,
        sometimes behavior varies, as here::

        r"""
        Transform ``self`` into a matrix in echelon form over the same
        base ring as self.

        .. NOTE::

            This row reduction does not use division if the
            matrix is not over a field (e.g., if the matrix is over
            the integers).  If you want to calculate the echelon form
            using division, then use :meth:`rref`, which assumes that
            the matrix entries are in a field (specifically, the field
            of fractions of the base ring of the matrix).

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- string. Which algorithm to use. Choices are

          - ``'default'``: Let Sage choose an algorithm (default).

          - ``'classical'``: Gauss elimination.

          - ``'partial_pivoting'``: Gauss elimination, using partial pivoting
            (if base ring has absolute value)

          - ``'scaled_partial_pivoting'``: Gauss elimination, using scaled
            partial pivoting (if base ring has absolute value)

          - ``'scaled_partial_pivoting_valuation'``: Gauss elimination, using
            scaled partial pivoting (if base ring has valuation)

          - ``'strassen'``: use a Strassen divide and conquer
            algorithm (if available)

        - ``cutoff`` -- integer. Only used if the Strassen algorithm
          is selected.

        - ``transformation`` -- boolean. Whether to also return the
          transformation matrix. Some matrix backends do not provide
          this information, in which case this option is ignored.

        OUTPUT:

        The matrix ``self`` is put into echelon form. Nothing is
        returned unless the keyword option ``transformation=True`` is
        specified, in which case the transformation matrix is
        returned.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: a = matrix(QQ,3,3,range(9)); a
            [0 1 2]
            [3 4 5]

            [ 0  1  2]
            [ 0  0  0]

        An immutable matrix cannot be transformed into echelon form. Use
        ``self.echelon_form()`` instead::

            sage: a = matrix(QQ,3,3,range(9)); a.set_immutable()
            sage: a.echelonize()
            Traceback (most recent call last):

            ValueError: matrix is immutable; please change a copy instead
            (i.e., use copy(M) to change a copy of M).

            [ 0  1  2]
            [ 0  0  0]

        Echelon form over the integers is what is also classically often
        known as Hermite normal form::

            sage: a = matrix(ZZ,3,3,range(9))
            sage: a.echelonize(); a
            [ 3  0 -3]
            [ 0  1  2]
            [ 0  0  0]

        We compute an echelon form both over a domain and fraction field::

            sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
            sage: a = matrix(R, 2, [x,y,x,y])
            sage: a.echelon_form()               # not very useful? -- why two copies of the same row?
            [x y]
            [x y]

        ::

            sage: b = a.change_ring(R.fraction_field())
            sage: b.echelon_form()               # potentially useful
            [  1 y/x]
            [  0   0]

        We check that the echelon form works for matrices over p-adics.

        Return the echelon form of self.

        .. NOTE::

            This row reduction does not use division if the
            matrix is not over a field (e.g., if the matrix is over
            the integers).  If you want to calculate the echelon form
            using division, then use :meth:`rref`, which assumes that
            the matrix entries are in a field (specifically, the field
            of fractions of the base ring of the matrix).

        INPUT:

        - ``algorithm`` -- string. Which algorithm to use. Choices are

          - ``'default'``: Let Sage choose an algorithm (default).

          - ``'classical'``: Gauss elimination.

          - ``'partial_pivoting'``: Gauss elimination, using partial pivoting
            (if base ring has absolute value)

          - ``'scaled_partial_pivoting'``: Gauss elimination, using scaled
            partial pivoting (if base ring has absolute value)

          - ``'scaled_partial_pivoting_valuation'``: Gauss elimination, using
            scaled partial pivoting (if base ring has valuation)

          - ``'strassen'``: use a Strassen divide and conquer
            algorithm (if available)

        - ``cutoff`` -- integer. Only used if the Strassen algorithm is selected.

        - ``transformation`` -- boolean. Whether to also return the
          transformation matrix. Some matrix backends do not provide
          this information, in which case this option is ignored.

        OUTPUT:

        The reduced row echelon form of ``self``, as an immutable
        matrix. Note that self is *not* changed by this command. Use
        :meth:`echelonize` to change ``self`` in place.

        If the optional parameter ``transformation=True`` is
        specified, the output consists of a pair `(E,T)` of matrices
        where `E` is the echelon form of ``self`` and `T` is the
        transformation matrix.

        r"""
        Returns the echelon form of ``self`` augmented with an identity matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``subdivide`` - default: ``False`` - determines if the
          returned matrix is subdivided.  See the description of the
          (output) below for details.
        - ``kwds`` - additional keywords that can be passed to
          the method that computes the echelon form.

        OUTPUT:

        If `A` is an `m\times n` matrix, add the `m` columns of an
        `m\times m` identity matrix to the right of ``self``.  Then
        row-reduce this `m\times(n+m)` matrix.  This matrix is returned
        as an immutable matrix.

        If ``subdivide`` is ``True`` then the returned matrix has a single
        division among the columns and a single division among the rows.
        The column subdivision has `n` columns to the left and `m`
        columns to the right.  The row division separates the non-zero rows
        from the zero rows, when restricted to the first `n` columns.

        For a nonsingular matrix the final `m` columns of the extended
        echelon form are the inverse of ``self``.  For a matrix of
        any size, the final `m` columns provide a matrix that transforms
        ``self`` to echelon form when it multiplies ``self`` from the left.
        When the base ring is a field, the uniqueness of reduced row-echelon
        form implies that this transformation matrix can be taken as the
        coefficients giving a
        canonical set of linear combinations of the rows of ``self`` that
        yield reduced row-echelon form.

        When subdivided as described above, and again over a field, the
        parts of the subdivision in the upper-left corner and lower-right
        corner satisfy several interesting relationships with the row space,
        column space, left kernel and right kernel of ``self``.  See the
        examples below.

        .. NOTE::

            This method returns an echelon form.  If the base ring
            is not a field, no attempt is made to move to the fraction field.
            See an example below where the base ring is changed manually.

            sage: A.left_kernel() == L.row_space()
            True

        For a nonsingular matrix, the right half of the extended
        echelon form is the inverse matrix. ::

            sage: B = matrix(QQ, [[1,3,4], [1,4,4], [0,-2,-1]])
            sage: E = B.extended_echelon_form()
            sage: J = E.matrix_from_columns(range(3,6)); J
            [-4  5  4]
            [-1  1  0]
            [ 2 -2 -1]
            sage: J == B.inverse()
            True

        The result is in echelon form, so if the base ring is
        not a field, the leading entry of each row may not be 1.
        But you can easily change to the fraction field if necessary.  ::

        Subdivided, or not, the result is immutable, so make a
        copy if you want to make changes.  ::

        If you want to determine exactly which algorithm is
        used to compute the echelon form, you can add additional
        keywords to pass on to the ``echelon_form()`` routine
        employed on the augmented matrix.  Sending the flag
        ``include_zero_rows`` is a bit silly, since the
        extended echelon form will never have any zero rows. ::

        Replace a proportion of the entries of a matrix by random elements,

        .. NOTE::

           The locations of the entries of the matrix to change are
           determined randomly, with the total number of locations
           determined by the ``density`` keyword. These locations
           are not guaranteed to be distinct.  So it is possible
           that the same position can be chosen multiple times,
           especially for a very small matrix.  The exception is
           when ``density = 1``, in which case every entry of the
           matrix will be changed.

           proportion of entries that are changed
        -  ``nonzero`` - Bool (default: ``False``); if ``True``, then new

        We then randomize roughly half the entries::

            sage: a.randomize(0.5)
            sage: a.density() <= 0.5
            True

        Now we randomize all the entries of the resulting matrix::

        Then we randomize it; the ``x`` and ``y`` keywords, which determine the

        Normal matrices are precisely those that can be diagonalized

        This routine is for matrices over exact rings and so may not

        :meth:`sage.matrix.matrix_double_dense.Matrix_double_dense.is_normal`
        method has a tolerance parameter.  This provides control over
        allowing for minor discrepancies between entries when checking
        equality.

        Returns the current matrix as a sum of permutation matrices

        According to the Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem, any bistochastic matrix
        can be written as a positive sum of permutation matrices, which also
        means that the polytope of bistochastic matrices is integer.

        As a non-bistochastic matrix can obviously not be written as a sum of
        permutations, this theorem is an equivalence.

        This function, given a bistochastic matrix, returns the corresponding
        decomposition.

        Visualize the non-zero entries

        White pixels are put at positions with zero entries. If 'maxsize'
        is given, then the maximal dimension in either x or y direction is
        set to 'maxsize' depending on which is bigger. If the image is
        scaled, the darkness of the pixel reflects how many of the
        represented entries are nonzero. So if e.g. one image pixel
        actually represents a 2x2 submatrix, the dot is darker the more of
        the four values are nonzero.

        INPUT:

        - ``maxsize`` - integer (default: ``512``). Maximal dimension
          in either x or y direction of the resulting image. If
          ``None`` or a maxsize larger than
          ``max(self.nrows(),self.ncols())`` is given the image will
          have the same pixelsize as the matrix dimensions.

    def QR(self, full=True):
        r"""
        Returns a factorization of ``self`` as a unitary matrix
        and an upper-triangular matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``full`` - default: ``True`` - if ``True`` then the
          returned matrices have dimensions as described below.
          If ``False`` the ``R`` matrix has no zero rows and the
          columns of ``Q`` are a basis for the column space of
          ``self``.

        OUTPUT:

        If ``self`` is an `m\times n` matrix and ``full=True`` then this
        method returns a pair of matrices: `Q` is an `m\times m` unitary
        matrix (meaning its inverse is its conjugate-transpose) and `R`
        is an `m\times n` upper-triangular matrix with non-negative entries
        on the diagonal.  For a matrix of full rank this factorization is
        unique (due to the restriction to positive entries on the diagonal).

        If ``full=False`` then `Q` has `m` rows and the columns form an
        orthonormal basis for the column space of ``self``.  So, in particular,
        the conjugate-transpose of `Q` times `Q` will be an identity matrix.
        The matrix `R` will still be upper-triangular but will also have full
        rank, in particular it will lack the zero rows present in a full
        factorization of a rank-deficient matrix.

        The results obtained when ``full=True`` are cached,
        hence `Q` and `R` are immutable matrices in this case.

        .. NOTE::

            This is an exact computation, so limited to exact rings.
            Also the base ring needs to have a fraction field implemented
            in Sage and this field must contain square roots.  One example
            is the field of algebraic numbers, ``QQbar``, as used in the
            examples below.  If you need numerical results, convert the
            base ring to the field of complex double numbers, ``CDF``,
            which will use a faster routine that is careful about
            numerical subtleties.

        Performs Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, with no scaling to unit vectors.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - is a matrix whose columns are to be orthogonalized.
          The base ring of the matrix needs to have its fraction field
          implemented.

        OUTPUT:

        Two matrices, ``Q`` and ``R`` such that if ``A`` represents ``self``:

        - ``A = Q*R``
        - The columns of ``Q`` are an orthogonal set which spans the
          column space of ``A``.
        - The conjugate-transpose of ``Q`` times ``Q`` is a diagonal matrix.
        - ``R`` is a full-rank matrix, that has all entries below the
          main diagonal equal to zero.

        This is basically a "reduced" QR decomposition of ``self`` with
        the distinction that the orthogonal column vectors of ``Q`` have
        not been scaled to unit vectors, avoiding the need to take square
        roots.

        r"""
        Performs Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization on the rows of the matrix,
        returning a new matrix and a matrix accomplishing the transformation.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a matrix whose rows are to be orthogonalized.
        - ``orthonormal`` - default: ``False`` - if ``True`` the
          returned orthogonal vectors are unit vectors.  This keyword
          is ignored if the matrix is over ``RDF`` or ``CDF`` and the
          results are always orthonormal.

        OUTPUT:

        A pair of matrices, ``G`` and ``M`` such that if ``A``
        represents ``self``, where the parenthetical properties occur
        when ``orthonormal = True``:

        - ``A = M*G``
        - The rows of ``G`` are an orthogonal (resp. orthonormal)
          set of vectors.
        - ``G`` times the conjugate-transpose of ``G`` is a diagonal
          (resp. identity) matrix.
        - The row space of ``G`` equals the row space of ``A``.
        - ``M`` is a full-rank matrix with zeros above the diagonal.

        For exact rings, any zero vectors produced (when the original
        vectors are linearly dependent) are not output, thus the
        orthonormal set is linearly independent, and thus a basis for the
        row space of the original matrix.

        Any notion of a Gram-Schmidt procedure requires that the base
        ring of the matrix has a fraction field implemented.  In order
        to arrive at an orthonormal set, it must be possible to construct
        square roots of the elements of the base field.  In Sage, your
        best option is the field of algebraic numbers, ``QQbar``, which
        properly contains the rationals and number fields.

        If you have an approximate numerical matrix, then this routine
        requires that your base field be the real and complex
        double-precision floating point numbers, ``RDF`` and ``CDF``.
        In this case, the matrix is treated as having full rank, as no
        attempt is made to recognize linear dependence with approximate
        calculations.

        Even though a set of vectors may be linearly dependent, no effort
        is made to decide when a zero vector is really the result of a
        relation of linear dependence.  So in this regard, input matrices
        are treated as being of full rank.  Try one of the base rings that

        Exact Rings, Orthonormalization:

        To scale a vector to unit length requires taking
        a square root, which often takes us outside the base ring.
        For the integers and the rationals, the field of algebraic numbers
        (``QQbar``) is big enough to contain what we need, but the price
        is that the computations are very slow, hence mostly of value
        for small cases or instruction. Now we need to use the
        ``orthonormal`` keyword.  ::

        Exact Rings, Orthogonalization:

        If we forego scaling orthogonal vectors to unit vectors, we
        can apply Gram-Schmidt to a much greater variety of rings.
        Use the ``orthonormal=False`` keyword (or assume it as the default).
        Note that now the orthogonality check creates a diagonal matrix
        whose diagonal entries are the squares of the lengths of the
        vectors.

    def jordan_form(self, base_ring=None, sparse=False, subdivide=True, transformation=False, eigenvalues=None, check_input=True):
        r"""
        Compute the Jordan normal form of this square matrix `A`, if it exists.

        This computation is performed in a naive way using the ranks of powers
        of `A-xI`, where `x` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.  If desired,
        a transformation matrix `P` can be returned, which is such that the
        Jordan canonical form is given by `P^{-1} A P`; if the matrix is
        diagonalizable, this equals to *eigendecomposition* or *spectral
        decomposition*.

        INPUT:

        - ``base_ring`` - Ring in which to compute the Jordan form.

        - ``sparse`` - (default ``False``) If ``sparse=True``, return a sparse
          matrix.

        - ``subdivide`` - (default ``True``) If ``subdivide=True``, the
          subdivisions for the Jordan blocks in the matrix are shown.

        - ``transformation`` - (default ``False``) If ``transformation=True``,
          computes also the transformation matrix.

        - ``eigenvalues`` - (default ``None``) A complete set of roots, with
          multiplicity, of the characteristic polynomial of `A`, encoded as
          a list of pairs, each having the form `(r, m)` with `r` a root and
          `m` its multiplicity. If this is ``None``, then Sage computes this
          list itself, but this is only possible over base rings in whose
          quotient fields polynomial factorization is implemented. Over all
          other rings, providing this list manually is the only way to
          compute Jordan normal forms.

        - ``check_input`` - (default ``True``) A Boolean specifying whether
          the list ``eigenvalues`` (if provided) has to be checked for
          correctness. Set this to ``False`` for a speedup if the eigenvalues
          are known to be correct.

        .. NOTE::

            Currently, the Jordan normal form is not computed over
            inexact rings in any but the trivial cases when the matrix
            is either `0 \times 0` or `1 \times 1`.

            In the case of exact rings, this method does not compute any
            generalized form of the Jordan normal form, but is only able to
            compute the result if the characteristic polynomial of the matrix
            splits over the specific base ring.

            Note that the base ring must be a field or a ring with an
            implemented fraction field.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: a = matrix(ZZ,4,[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
            ....:                  1, -1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 1, 2]); a

            sage: b = matrix(ZZ,3,3,range(9)); b

            [3 4 5]
            [6 7 8]
            sage: b.jordan_form()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: Some eigenvalue does not exist in Rational Field.
            sage: b.jordan_form(RealField(15))
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: Jordan normal form not implemented over inexact rings.

        Here we need to specify a field, since the eigenvalues are not defined
        in the smallest ring containing the matrix entries (:trac:`14508`)::

            sage: c = matrix([[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,0,0]])
            sage: c.jordan_form(CyclotomicField(3))
            [         1|         0|         0]
            [----------+----------+----------]
            [         0|     zeta3|         0]
            [----------+----------+----------]
            [         0|         0|-zeta3 - 1]

        If you need the transformation matrix as well as the Jordan form of
        ``self``, then pass the option ``transformation=True``. For example::

            sage: m = matrix([[5,4,2,1],[0,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,3,0],[1,1,-1,2]]); m
            [ 5  4  2  1]
            [ 0  1 -1 -1]
            [-1 -1  3  0]
            [ 1  1 -1  2]
            sage: jf, p = m.jordan_form(transformation=True)
            sage: jf
            [2|0|0 0]
            [-+-+---]
            [0|1|0 0]
            [-+-+---]
            [0|0|4 1]
            [0|0|0 4]
            sage: ~p * m * p
            [2 0 0 0]
            [0 1 0 0]
            [0 0 4 1]
            [0 0 0 4]

        Note that for matrices over inexact rings, we do not attempt to
        compute the Jordan normal form, since it is not numerically
        stable::

            sage: b = matrix(ZZ,3,3,range(9))
            sage: jf, p = b.jordan_form(RealField(15), transformation=True)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: Jordan normal form not implemented over inexact rings.

        TESTS::

            sage: n = sum(range(1,6))
            sage: jf = block_diagonal_matrix([jordan_block(ev,size) for ev,size in evals])
            sage: p = random_matrix(ZZ,n,n)
            sage: while p.rank() != n: p = random_matrix(ZZ,n,n)

        OUTPUT:

            P^{-1}AP = D

        This routine returns ``True`` if ``self`` is diagonalizable.
        The diagonal entries of the matrix `D` are the eigenvalues
        of `A`.

        A matrix not diagonalizable over the base field may become
        diagonalizable by extending the base field to contain all of the
        eigenvalues. Over the rationals, the field of algebraic numbers,
        :mod:`sage.rings.qqbar` is a good choice.

        To obtain the matrices `D` and `P`, use the :meth:`diagonalization`
        method.

        ALGORITHM:

        For each eigenvalue, this routine checks that the algebraic
        multiplicity (number of occurrences as a root of the characteristic
        polynomial) is equal to the geometric multiplicity (dimension
        of the eigenspace), which is sufficient to ensure a basis of
        eigenvectors for the columns of `P`.

        Return ``True`` if ``self`` and ``other`` are similar,

        INPUT:

        - ``other`` -- a matrix, which should be square, and of the same size
          as ``self``.

        - ``transformation`` -- default: ``False`` - if ``True``, the output
          may include the change-of-basis matrix (also known as the similarity
          transformation). See below for an exact description.

        OUTPUT:

        Two matrices, `A` and `B` are similar if they are square
        matrices of the same size and there is an invertible matrix
        `S` such that `A=S^{-1}BS`. `S` can be interpreted as a
        change-of-basis matrix if `A` and `B` are viewed as matrix
        representations of the same linear transformation from a vector space
        to itself.

        When ``transformation=False`` this method will return ``True`` if
        such a matrix `S` exists, otherwise it will return ``False``.  When
        ``transformation=True`` the method returns a pair. The first part
        of the pair is ``True`` or ``False`` depending on if the matrices
        are similar. The second part of the pair is the change-of-basis
        matrix when the matrices are similar and ``None`` when the matrices
        are not similar.

        When a similarity transformation matrix ``S``  is requested,
        it will satisfy ``self = S.inverse()*other*S``.

        .. RUBRIC:: rings and coefficients

        Inexact rings are not supported. Only rings having a
        fraction field can be used as coefficients.

        The base rings for the matrices are promoted to a common
        field for the similarity check using rational form over this field.

        If the fraction fields of both matrices are the same, this
        field is used. Otherwise, if the fraction fields are only
        related by a canonical coercion, the common coercion field
        is used.

        In all cases, the result is about similarity over a common field.

        .. RUBRIC:: similarity transformation

        For computation of the similarity transformation, the
        matrices are first checked to be similar over their common
        field.

        In this case, a similarity transformation is then
        searched for over the common field. If this fails, the
        matrices are promoted to the algebraic closure of their
        common field (whenever it is available) and a similarity
        transformation is looked for over the algebraic closure.

        For example, matrices over the rationals
        may be promoted to the field of algebraic numbers (``QQbar``)
        for computation of the similarity transformation.

        .. WARNING::

            When the two matrices are similar, this routine may
            fail to find the similarity transformation.  A technical
            explanation follows.

        The similarity check is accomplished with rational form, which
        will be successful for any pair of matrices over the same field.
        However, the computation of rational form does not provide a
        transformation. So we instead compute Jordan form, which does
        provide a transformation.  But Jordan form will require that
        the eigenvalues of the matrix can be represented within Sage,
        requiring the existence of the appropriate extension field.
        When this is not possible, a ``RuntimeError`` is raised, as
        demonstrated in an example below.

        EXAMPLES:

        The two matrices in this example were constructed to be similar.
        The computations happen in the field of algebraic numbers, but we
        are able to convert the change-of-basis matrix back to the rationals
        (which may not always be possible). ::

        Similarity is an equivalence relation, so this routine computes
        a representative of the equivalence class for each matrix, the
        rational form, as provided by :meth:`rational_form`.  The matrices
        below have identical eigenvalues (as evidenced by equal
        characteristic polynomials), but slightly different rational forms,
        and hence are not similar.  ::

        Obtaining the transformation between two similar matrices
        requires the Jordan form, which requires computing the
        eigenvalues of the matrix, which may not lie in the field
        used for entries of the matrix.  In this unfortunate case,
        the computation of the transformation may fail with a
        ``RuntimeError``, EVEN when the matrices are similar.  This
        is not the case for matrices over the integers, rationals
        or algebraic numbers, since the computations are done in
        the algebraically closed field of algebraic numbers.

        Find a symplectic form for self if self is an anti-symmetric,
        alternating matrix defined over a field.

        Returns a pair (F, C) such that the rows of C form a symplectic
        basis for self and F = C \* self \* C.transpose().

        Raises a ValueError if not over a field, or self is not
        anti-symmetric, or self is not alternating.

        Anti-symmetric means that `M = -M^t`. Alternating means
        that the diagonal of `M` is identically zero.

        A symplectic basis is a basis of the form
        `e_1, \ldots, e_j, f_1, \ldots f_j, z_1, \dots, z_k`
        such that

        - `z_i M v^t` = 0 for all vectors `v`

        - `e_i M {e_j}^t = 0` for all `i, j`

        - `f_i M {f_j}^t = 0` for all `i, j`

    def _cyclic_subspace(self, v):
        r"""
        Helper function for computing with cyclic (Krylov) subspaces.

        For a square matrix `A` and a vector `v`, the cyclic subspace
        is spanned by the vectors

        .. MATH::

            \{v, Av, A^2v, A^3v, \dots \}

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a square matrix over a field.

        - ``v`` - a vector with a degree equal to the size of the matrix.

        There is no explicit error-checking, it is the responsibility of
        the calling routine to provide accurate input.

        OUTPUT:

        Four related items are output.  Principally this routine
        determines the dimension of a cyclic subspace, but also
        creates two bases for the subspace.  Let `k` be the smallest
        integer such that `A^kv` is a linear combination of the
        products with smaller powers of `A`, i.e. the dimension
        of the cyclic subspace.

        - A list of the vectors `v, Av, A^2v,\dots, A^{k-1}v`
          (the "iterates").  These vectors give one basis of
          the subspace.

        - A list of scalars giving a linear combination of
          `v, Av, A^2v,\dots, A^kv` that equals the zero vector.
          This is the unique such set of such scalars where the
          last one in the list is 1.  These can be used to form
          a monic polynomial in `A` that has `v` in its right kernel.
          the length of this list is `k+1`.

        - Form a matrix whose rows are the linearly independent iterates.
          Augment with a `k\times k` identity matrix.  Apply row operations,
          scaling and adding multiples of rows, but never swap rows.  Do
          this to create `k` pivot columns.  The third output is this
          augmented, nearly row-reduced, matrix.  The rows of the left
          portion will form a basis for the subspace, while the right
          portion will record linear combinations of the iterates that
          equal these basis vectors.

        - A list of length `k` with the location of the pivots
          in the augmented matrix.  Specifically, entry  ``i``  of this
          list is the column index of the pivot column containing its
          lone 1 in row ``i``.

        ALGORITHM:

        This could be called an "online echelon form" routine.  As each
        new power of the matrix is built, the iterate is added to the bottom
        of the augmented matrix and row operations are used to update
        the pivot columns.  Rows are never swapped, so this is not
        strictly reduced row-echelon form, but the running time will
        be similar.  The main difference is that it "discovers" the
        dimension of the subspace as quickly as possible.

    def cyclic_subspace(self, v, var=None, basis='echelon'):
        r"""
        Create a cyclic subspace for a vector, and optionally,
        a minimal polynomial for the iterated powers.

        These subspaces are also known as Krylov subspaces.  They are
        spanned by the vectors

        .. MATH::

            \{v, Av, A^2v, A^3v, \dots \}

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a square matrix with entries from a field.

        - ``v`` - a vector with a degree equal to the size of the matrix
          and entries compatible with the entries of the matrix.

        - ``var`` - default: ``None`` - if specified as a string or
          a generator of a polynomial ring, then this will be used
          to construct a polynomial reflecting a relation of linear
          dependence on the powers `A^iv` *and* this will cause
          the polynomial to be returned along with the subspace.
          A generator must create polynomials with coefficients from
          the same field as the matrix entries.

        - ``basis`` - default: ``echelon`` - the basis for the
          subspace is "echelonized" by default, but the keyword
          'iterates' will return a subspace with a user basis
          equal to the largest linearly independent
          set `\{v, Av, A^2v, A^3v, \dots, A^{k-1}v \}`.

        OUTPUT:

        Suppose `k` is the smallest power such that
        `\{v, Av, A^2v, A^3v, \dots, A^{k}v \}` is linearly
        dependent.  Then the subspace returned will have
        dimension `k` and be spanned by the powers `0` through
        `k-1`.

        If a polynomial is requested through the use of the
        ``var`` keyword, then a pair is returned, with the
        polynomial first and the subspace second.  The polynomial
        is the unique monic polynomial whose coefficients provide
        a relation of linear dependence on the first `k` powers.

        For less convenient, but more flexible output, see the
        helper method "_cyclic_subspace" in this module.

        The polynomial has coefficients that yield a non-trivial
        relation of linear dependence on the iterates.  Or,
        equivalently, evaluating the polynomial with the matrix
        will create a matrix that annihilates the vector.  ::

    def cholesky(self):
        r"""
        Returns the Cholesky decomposition of a Hermitian matrix.

        INPUT:

        A positive-definite matrix. Generally, the base ring for the
        entries of the matrix needs to be a subfield of the algebraic
        numbers (``QQbar``). Examples include the rational numbers
        (``QQ``), some number fields, and real algebraic numbers and
        the algebraic numbers themselves. Symbolic matrices can also
        occasionally be factored.

        OUTPUT:

        For a matrix `A` the routine returns a lower triangular
        matrix `L` such that,

        .. MATH::

            A = LL^\ast

        where `L^\ast` is the conjugate-transpose. If the matrix is
        not positive-definite (for example, if it is not Hermitian)
        then a ``ValueError`` results.

        If possible, the output matrix will be over the fraction field
        of the base ring of the input matrix. If that fraction field
        is missing the requisite square roots but if no imaginaries
        are encountered, then the algebraic-reals will be used.
        Otherwise, the algebraic closure of the fraction field
        (typically ``QQbar``) will be used.

        ALGORITHM:

        First we ensure that the matrix `A`
        :meth:`~.Matrix.is_hermitian`. Afterwards, we attempt to
        compute a classical :meth:`block_ldlt` factorization, `A =
        LDL^{*}`, of the matrix. If that fails, then the matrix was
        not positive-definite and an error is raised. Otherwise we
        take the entrywise square-root `\sqrt{D}` of the diagonal
        matrix `D` (whose entries are the positive eigenvalues of the
        original matrix) to obtain the Cholesky factorization `A =
        \left(L\sqrt{D}\right)\left(L\sqrt{D}\right)^{*}`. If the
        necessary square roots cannot be taken in the fraction field
        of original base ring, then we move to either its algebraic
        closure or the algebraic reals, depending on whether or not
        imaginary numbers are required.

        EXAMPLES:

        This simple example has a result with entries that remain
        in the field of rational numbers::

        This seemingly simple example requires first moving to
        the rational numbers for field operations, and then square
        roots necessitate that the result has entries in the field
        of algebraic numbers::

        Some subfields of the complex numbers, such as this number
        field of complex numbers with rational real and imaginary parts,

        The field of algebraic numbers is an ideal setting for this
        computation::

        Results are cached, hence immutable.  Use the ``copy`` function
        if you need to make a change::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[ 4, -2,  4,  2],
            ....:                 [-2, 10, -2, -7],
            ....:                 [ 4, -2,  8,  4],
            ....:                 [ 2, -7,  4,  7]])
            sage: L = A.cholesky()
            sage: L.is_immutable()
            True
            sage: from copy import copy
            sage: LC = copy(L)
            sage: LC[0,0] = 1000
            sage: LC
            [1000    0    0    0]
            [  -1    3    0    0]
            [   2    0    2    0]
            [   1   -2    1    1]

        The base ring need not be exact, although you should expect
        the result to be inexact (correct only in the norm) as well
        in that case::

            sage: F = RealField(100)
            sage: A = A = matrix(F, [[1.0, 2.0], [2.0, 6.0]])
            sage: L = A.cholesky(); L
            [ 1.000... 0.000...]
            [ 2.000... 1.414...]
            sage: (L*L.transpose() - A).norm() < 1e-10
            True

        Even symbolic matrices can sometimes be factored::

            sage: A = matrix(SR, [[pi,0],[0,pi]])
            sage: A.cholesky()
            [sqrt(pi)        0]
            [       0 sqrt(pi)]

        There are a variety of situations which will prevent the
        computation of a Cholesky decomposition.

        The base ring may not be able to be viewed as a subset of the
        complex numbers, implying that "Hermitian" is meaningless::

            sage: A = matrix(Integers(6), [[2, 0], [0, 4]])

        The matrix may not be Hermitian::

        Compute the inverse of a positive-definite matrix.

        In accord with :meth:`is_positive_definite`, only Hermitian
        matrices are considered positive-definite. Positive-definite
        matrices have several factorizations (Cholesky, LDLT, et
        cetera) that allow them to be inverted in a fast,
        numerically-stable way. This method uses an appropriate
        factorization, and is akin to the ``cholinv`` and ``chol2inv``
        functions available in R, Octave, and Stata.

        You should ensure that your matrix is positive-definite before
        using this method. When in doubt, use the generic
        :meth:`inverse` method instead.

        OUTPUT:

        If the given matrix is positive-definite, the return value is
        the same as that of the :meth:`inverse` method. If the matrix
        is not positive-definite, the behavior of this function is
        undefined.

        Finds a decomposition into a lower-triangular matrix and
        an upper-triangular matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``pivot`` - pivoting strategy

          - 'auto' (default) - see if the matrix entries are
            ordered (i.e. if they have an absolute value method),
            and if so, use a the partial pivoting strategy.
            Otherwise, fall back to the nonzero strategy.  This
            is the best choice for general routines that may
            call this for matrix entries of a variety of types.

          - 'partial' - each column is examined for
            the element with the largest absolute value and the
            row containing this element is swapped into place.

          - 'nonzero' - the first nonzero element in a column
            is located and the row with this element is used.

        - ``format`` - contents of output, see more discussion
          below about output.

          - 'plu' (default) - a triple; matrices P, L and U
            such that A = P*L*U.

          - 'compact' - a pair; row permutation as a tuple, and the
            matrices L and U combined into one matrix.

        OUTPUT:

        Suppose that `A` is an `m\times n` matrix, then an LU
        decomposition is a lower-triangular `m\times m` matrix
        `L` with every diagonal element equal to 1, and an
        upper-triangular `m\times n` matrix, `U` such that the
        product `LU`, after a permutation of the rows, is then
        equal to `A`.  For the 'plu' format the permutation is
        returned as an `m\times m` permutation matrix `P` such
        that

        .. MATH::

            A = PLU

        It is more common to place the permutation matrix just
        to the left of `A`.  If you desire this version, then
        use the inverse of `P` which is computed most efficiently
        as its transpose.

        If the 'partial' pivoting strategy is used, then the
        non-diagonal entries of `L` will be less than or equal
        to 1 in absolute value.  The 'nonzero' pivot strategy may
        be faster, but the growth of data structures for elements of
        the decomposition might counteract the advantage.

        By necessity, returned matrices have a base ring equal
        to the fraction field of the base ring of the original matrix.

        In the 'compact' format, the first returned value is a
        tuple that is a permutation of the rows of `LU` that yields
        `A`.  See the doctest for how you might employ this
        permutation.  Then the matrices `L` and `U` are merged
        into one matrix -- remove the diagonal of ones in `L`
        and the remaining nonzero entries can replace the
        entries of `U` beneath the diagonal.

        The results are cached, only in the compact format, separately
        for each pivot strategy called.  Repeated requests for the
        'plu' format will require just a small amount of overhead
        in each call to bust out the compact format to the three
        matrices.  Since only the compact format is cached, the
        components of the compact format are immutable, while the
        components of the 'plu' format are regenerated, and hence
        are mutable.

        Notice that while `U` is similar to row-echelon form and the
        rows of `U` span the row space of `A`, the rows of `U` are not
        generally linearly independent.  Nor are the pivot columns
        (or rank) immediately obvious.  However for rings without
        specialized echelon form routines, this method is about
        twice as fast as the generic echelon form routine since
        it only acts "below the diagonal", as would be predicted
        from a theoretical analysis of the algorithms.

        .. NOTE::

            This is an exact computation, so limited to exact
            rings. If you need numerical results, convert the
            base ring to the field of real double numbers,
            ``RDF`` or the field of complex double numbers,
            ``CDF``, which will use a faster routine that
            is careful about numerical subtleties.

        EXAMPLES:

        Notice the difference in the `L` matrix as a result of different
        pivoting strategies.  With partial pivoting, every entry of `L`
        has absolute value 1 or less.  ::

        We can easily illustrate the relationships between
        the two formats with a square matrix.  ::

            sage: C = matrix(QQ, [[-2,  3, -2, -5],
            ....:                 [ 1, -2,  1,  3],

            sage: (L - identity_matrix(4)) + U == M
            True
            sage: p = [perm[i]+1 for i in range(len(perm))]
            sage: PP = Permutation(p).to_matrix()
            sage: PP == P
            True

        For a nonsingular matrix, and the 'nonzero' pivot
        strategy there is no need to permute rows, so the
        permutation matrix will be the identity.  Furthermore,
        it can be shown that then the `L` and `U` matrices
        are uniquely determined by requiring `L` to have ones
        on the diagonal.  ::

    def _indefinite_factorization(self, algorithm, check=True):
        r"""
        Utility function to decomposes a symmetric or
        Hermitian matrix into a lower triangular matrix
        and tuple of elements for the diagonal of a diagonal matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a matrix that is symmetric or Hermitian,
          over a ring that has a fraction field implemented.

        - ``algorithm`` - ``'symmetric'`` or ``'hermitian'``,
          according to the corresponding property of the matrix.

        - ``check`` - default: ``True`` - if ``True`` then
          performs the check that the matrix is consistent with the
          ``algorithm`` keyword.

        OUTPUT:

        Given a square matrix ``A``, the routine returns a
        pair: a matrix ``L`` and a list ``d``.

        ``L`` is a unit lower-triangular matrix.  ``d`` is
        the entries of a diagonal matrix.  Suppose this diagonal
        matrix is ``D``.  Then, for a symmetric matrix, these items
        are related as:

        .. MATH::

            A = LDL^T

        For a Hermitian matrix, the transpose can be replaced by
        the conjugate-transpose.

        If any leading principal submatrix is singular, then the
        computation cannot be performed and a ``ValueError`` results.

        Results are cached, and hence are immutable.  Caching
        eliminates redundant computations across
        :meth:`indefinite_factorization_`, :meth:`is_positive_definite`
        and :meth:`cholesky_decomposition`.

        r"""
        Decomposes a symmetric or Hermitian matrix into a
        lower triangular matrix and a diagonal matrix.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a square matrix over a ring.  The base ring
          must have an implemented fraction field.

        - ``algorithm`` - default: ``'symmetric'``.  Either
          ``'symmetric'`` or ``'hermitian'``, according to if
          the input matrix is symmetric or hermitian.

        - ``check`` - default: ``True`` - if ``True`` then
          performs the check that the matrix is consistent with the
          ``algorithm`` keyword.

        OUTPUT:

        A lower triangular matrix `L` with each diagonal element
        equal to `1` and a vector of entries that form a
        diagonal matrix `D`.  The vector of diagonal entries
        can be easily used to form the matrix, as demonstrated
        below in the examples.

        For a symmetric matrix, `A`, these will be related by

        .. MATH::

            A = LDL^T

        If `A` is Hermitian matrix, then the transpose of `L`
        should be replaced by the conjugate-transpose of `L`.

        If any leading principal submatrix (a square submatrix
        in the upper-left corner) is singular then this method will
        fail with a ``ValueError``.

        ALGORITHM:

        The algorithm employed only uses field operations,
        but the computation of each diagonal entry has the potential
        for division by zero.  The number of operations is of order
        `n^3/3`, which is half the count for an LU decomposition.
        This makes it an appropriate candidate for solving systems
        with symmetric (or Hermitian) coefficient matrices.

        EXAMPLES:

        There is no requirement that a matrix be positive definite, as
        indicated by the negative entries in the resulting diagonal
        matrix.  The default is that the input matrix is symmetric. ::

        Optionally, Hermitian matrices can be factored

        identical).  Here, the field is all complex numbers
        with rational real and imaginary parts.  As theory
        predicts, the diagonal entries will be real numbers.  ::

        If a leading principal submatrix has zero determinant, this

        function returns three nice matrices, this one returns

          * An array ``p`` of the first `n` natural numbers, permuted

            (strict) upper-triangular portion is junk,
          * A list of the block-diagonal entries of ``D``.

        This is mainly useful to avoid having to "undo" the
        construction of the matrix `D` when we don't need it. For
        example, it's much easier to compute the inertia of a matrix

        Compute a block-`LDL^{T}` factorization of a Hermitian
        matrix.

        The standard `LDL^{T}` factorization of a positive-definite
        matrix `A` factors it as `A = LDL^{T}` where `L` is
        unit-lower-triangular and `D` is diagonal. If one allows
        row/column swaps via a permutation matrix `P`, then this
        factorization can be extended to many positive-semidefinite
        matrices `A` via the factorization `P^{T}AP = LDL^{T}` that
        places the zeros at the bottom of `D` to avoid division by
        zero. These factorizations extend easily to complex Hermitian
        matrices when one replaces the transpose by the
        conjugate-transpose.

        However, we can go one step further. If, in addition, we allow
        `D` to potentially contain `2 \times 2` blocks on its
        diagonal, then every real or complex Hermitian matrix `A` can
        be factored as `A = PLDL^{*}P^{T}`. When the row/column swaps
        are made intelligently, this process is numerically stable
        over inexact rings like ``RDF``.  Bunch and Kaufman describe
        such a "pivot" scheme that is suitable for the solution of
        Hermitian systems, and that is how we choose our row and
        column swaps.

        INPUT:

          * ``classical`` -- (default: ``False``) whether or not to
            attempt a classical non-block `LDL^{T}` factorization
            with no row/column swaps.

        .. WARNING::

            Not all matrices have a classical `LDL^{T}` factorization.
            Set ``classical=True`` at your own risk, preferably after
            verifying that your matrix is positive-definite and (over
            inexact rings) not ill-conditioned.

        OUTPUT:

        If the input matrix is not Hermitian, the output from this
        function is undefined. Otherwise, we return a triple `(P,L,D)`
        such that `A = PLDL^{*}P^{T}` and

          * `P` is a permutation matrix,
          * `L` is unit lower-triangular,
          * `D` is a block-diagonal matrix whose blocks are of size
            one or two.

        With ``classical=True``, the permutation matrix `P` is always
        an identity matrix and the diagonal blocks are always
        one-by-one. A ``ValueError`` is raised if the matrix has no
        classical `LDL^{T}` factorization.

        ALGORITHM:

        We essentially follow "Algorithm A" in the paper by Bunch and
        Kaufman [BK1977]_ that describes the stable pivoting strategy.
        The same scheme is described by Higham [Hig2002]_.

        EXAMPLES:

        This three-by-three real symmetric matrix has one positive, one
        negative, and one zero eigenvalue -- so it is not any flavor of
        (semi)definite, yet we can still factor it::

            sage: A =  matrix(QQ, [[0, 1, 0],
            ....:                  [1, 1, 2],
            ....:                  [0, 2, 0]])
            sage: P,L,D = A.block_ldlt()
            sage: P
            [0 0 1]
            [1 0 0]
            [0 1 0]
            sage: L
            [  1   0   0]
            [  2   1   0]
            [  1 1/2   1]
            sage: D
            [ 1| 0| 0]
            [--+--+--]
            [ 0|-4| 0]
            [--+--+--]
            [ 0| 0| 0]
            sage: P.transpose()*A*P == L*D*L.transpose()
            True

        This two-by-two matrix has no classical factorization, but it
        constitutes its own block-factorization::

            sage: A = matrix(QQ, [ [0,1],
            ....:                  [1,0] ])
            sage: A.block_ldlt(classical=True)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: matrix has no classical LDL^T factorization
            sage: A.block_ldlt()
            (
            [1 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]
            [0 1], [0 1], [1 0]
            )

        The same is true of the following complex Hermitian matrix::

            sage: A = matrix(QQbar, [ [ 0,I],
            ....:                     [-I,0] ])
            sage: A.block_ldlt(classical=True)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: matrix has no classical LDL^T factorization
            sage: A.block_ldlt()

            [1 0]  [1 0]  [ 0  I]
            [0 1], [0 1], [-I  0]
            )

        Complete diagonal pivoting could cause problems for the
        following matrix, since the diagonal entries are small
        compared to the off-diagonals that must be zeroed; however,
        the block algorithm refuses to factor it::

            sage: A = matrix(RDF, 2, 2, [ [1e-10, 1    ],
            ....:                         [1    , 2e-10] ])
            sage: _,L,D = A.block_ldlt(classical=True)
            sage: L*D*L.T
            [1e-10   1.0]
            [  1.0   0.0]
            sage: A.block_ldlt()
            (
            [1.0 0.0]  [1.0 0.0]  [1e-10   1.0]
            [0.0 1.0], [0.0 1.0], [  1.0 2e-10]
            )

        The factorization over an inexact ring is necessarily inexact,
        but `P^{T}AP` will ideally be close to `LDL^{*}` in the metric
        induced by the norm::

            sage: A = matrix(CDF, 2, 2, [ [-1.1933, -0.3185 - 1.3553*I],
            ....:                         [-0.3185 + 1.3553*I, 1.5729 ] ])
            sage: P,L,D = A.block_ldlt()
            sage: P.T*A*P == L*D*L.H
            False
            sage: (P.T*A*P - L*D*L.H).norm() < 1e-10
            True

        This matrix has a singular three-by-three leading principal
        submatrix, and therefore has no classical factorization::

        Determine if a matrix is positive-definite.

        vector `x`,

        .. MATH::

            \left\langle Ax, x \right\rangle > 0.

        ALGORITHM:

        A Hermitian matrix is positive-definite if and only if the
        diagonal blocks in its :meth:`block_ldlt` factorization are
        all 1-by-1 and have positive entries. We first check that the
        matrix :meth:`~.Matrix.is_hermitian`, and then compute this
        factorization.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` -- a matrix
        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) return the
          lower-triangular and diagonal parts of the :meth:`block_ldlt`
          factorization when the matrix is positive-definite. Deprecated.

        OUTPUT:

        This routine will return ``True`` if the matrix is Hermitian
        and meets the condition above for the quadratic form.

        The base ring for the elements of the matrix must

        1. Have a fraction field implemented; and
        2. Be a subring of the real numbers, complex numbers,
           or symbolic ring.

        If ``certificate`` is ``True``, a triplet ``(b, L, d)`` will
        be returned instead, with ``b`` containing the result (true or
        false). If the matrix is positive-definite, then ``L`` and
        ``d`` will contain the lower-triangular and diagonal parts of
        the :meth:`block_ldlt` factorization, respectively. Or if the
        matrix is not positive-definite (that is, if ``b`` is
        ``False``), then both ``L`` and ``d`` will be ``None``.

            This function is sometimes known as the "adjoint" of a matrix,

        Matrices over base rings that can be embedded in the
        real numbers will behave as expected. ::

        The conjugate of a matrix is formed by taking conjugates of
        all the entries.  Some specialized subfields of the complex numbers
        are implemented in Sage and complex conjugation can be applied.
        (Matrices over quadratic number fields are another
        class of examples.) ::

            sage: C = CyclotomicField(5)
            sage: a = C.gen(); a
            zeta5
            sage: CC(a)

            [             zeta5^3]
            [-zeta5^3 - zeta5 - 1]

        Furthermore, this method can be applied to matrices over
        quadratic extensions of finite fields::

            sage: F.<a> = GF(9,'a')
            sage: N = matrix(F, 2, [0,a,-a,1]); N
            [  0   a]

            [2*a + 1       1]

        Conjugation does not make sense over rings not containing complex
        numbers or finite fields which are not a quadratic extension::

    def smith_form(self, transformation=True, integral=None, exact=True):

        Return a Smith normal form of this matrix.

        For a matrix `M`, a Smith normal form is a matrix `S = UMV` such that:

        * `U` and `V` are invertible matrices
        * the only non-vanishing entries of `S` are located on the diagonal
          (though `S` might not be a square matrix)
        * if `d_i` denotes the entry of `S` at `(i,i)`, then `d_i` divides
          `d_{i+1}` for all `i`, i.e., the `d_i` are the ordered
          :meth:`elementary_divisors` of `M`

        Note that the matrices `U` and `V` are not uniquely determined and the
        `d_i` are only uniquely determined up to units. For some base rings,
        such as local rings, the `d_i` might be further normalized, see
        ``LOCAL RINGS`` below.

        If the base ring is not a PID, the routine might work, or else it will
        fail having found an example of a non-principal ideal. Note that we do
        not call any methods to check whether or not the base ring is a PID,
        since this might be quite expensive (e.g. for rings of integers of
        number fields of large degree).

        INPUT:

        - ``transformation`` -- a boolean (default: ``True``); whether the
          matrices `U` and `V` should be returned

        - ``integral`` -- a subring of the base ring, boolean or ``None``
          (default: ``None``); the entries of `U` and `V` are taken
          from this subring. If ``True``, the ring is taken to be the
          ring of integers of the base ring; if ``False`` the fraction field
          of the base ring; if ``None`` the base ring itself.
          When a subring is specified, multiplying
          by the denominator must map the entries into the subring; in this
          case the transformation matrices will have entries in this subring.

        - ``exact`` -- a boolean (default: ``True``), only used for local rings/fields.
          See ``LOCAL RINGS`` for more details.

        OUTPUT:

        The matrices `S, U, V` or the matrix `S` depending on
        ``transformation``.

        ALGORITHM:

        If the base ring has a method ``_matrix_smith_form``, use it; note that
        ``_matrix_smith_form`` might choose to further normalize the output.

        Otherwise, use the algorithm from :wikipedia:`Smith_normal_form`.

        LOCAL RINGS:

        Over local rings, we normalize `S` to only contain powers of the uniformizer.

        In order to simplify the precision handling, we truncate the absolute precision
        of the input matrix to the minimum absolute precision of any of its entries.
        As long as all of the elementary divisors are nonzero modulo this precision,
        they can be determined exactly since they are defined to be powers of the
        uniformizer.  In this case, which is specified by the keyword ``exact=True``,
        one of the transformation matrices will be inexact: `U` in the case that
        the number of rows is at least the number of columns, and `V` otherwise.

        If ``exact=False``, we instead return an inexact Smith form.  Now the
        transformation matrices are exact and we can deal gracefully with
        elementary divisors that are zero modulo the working precision.  However,
        the off-diagonal entries of the smith form carry a precision that
        can affect the precision of future calculations.

        See ``_matrix_smith_form`` on the base ring for more detail.

            [            0 x^2 - 2*x + 1], [    1 x - 3], [    0     1]
            )

            True

        Some pathological cases that crashed earlier versions::

            True

    def _zigzag_form(self, bint basis=True):
        r"""
        Helper method for computation of ZigZag form.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a square matrix over an exact field.

        - ``basis`` - default; ``True`` - controls whether or not to
          compute a change-of-basis matrix (also called a transformation
          matrix).

        OUTPUT:

        See the documentation for the :meth:`zigzag_form` method for a
        description of ZigZag form and notes on the algorithm employed.

        When ``basis=True`` four items are returned.  The first is a matrix
        whose columns form a basis so that a matrix representation of ``self``
        relative to this basis will be the ZigZag form.  More precisely, if
        `A` is the matrix, `U` is the change-of-basis matrix and `Z` is
        the ZigZag form, then

        .. MATH::

            U^{-1}*A*U = Z

        The second item returned is the ZigZag form of the matrix.  The
        third item is a list of lists, where each list is the coefficients
        of the polynomial associated with a companion matrix in the form.
        Finally, the fourth item is a list of the entries in the upper-left
        corner of each off-diagonal block, which will be a zero or a one.
        The length of the list of corner entries will be one less than the
        length of list of polynomials.

        When ``basis=False`` only three items are returned.  These are
        just as above, but without the change-of-basis matrix.

        The computation of the change-of-basis matrix has not been optimized.
        As a helper method, no error checking is performed on the inputs -
        that should be performed by the calling method.

        ALGORITHM:

        ZigZag form, and its computation, are due to Arne Storjohann
        and are  described in [Sto2000]_ and
        [Sto1998]_, where the former is more
        representative of the code here.

    def zigzag_form(self, subdivide=True, transformation=False):
        r"""
        Find a matrix in ZigZag form that is similar to ``self``.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a square matrix with entries from an exact field.

        - ``transformation`` - default: False - if ``True`` return a
          change-of-basis matrix relating the matrix and its ZigZag form.

        - ``subdivide`` - default: ``True`` - if ``True`` the ZigZag
          form matrix is subdivided according to the companion matrices
          described in the output section below.

        OUTPUT:

        A matrix in ZigZag form has blocks on the main diagonal that are
        companion matrices.  The first companion matrix has ones just below
        the main diagonal.  The last column has the negatives of coefficients
        of a monic polynomial, but not the leading one.  Low degree monomials
        have their coefficients in the earlier rows.  The second companion
        matrix is like the first only transposed.  The third is like the first.
        The fourth is like the second.  And so on.

        These blocks on the main diagonal define blocks just off the diagonal.
        To the right of the first companion matrix, and above the second
        companion matrix is a block that is totally zero, except the entry
        of the first row and first column may be a one.  Below the second
        block and to the left of the third block is a block that is totally
        zero, except the entry of the first row and first column may be one.
        This alternating pattern continues. It may now be apparent how this
        form gets its name.  Any other entry of the matrix is zero.  So this
        form is reminiscent of rational canonical form and is a good precursor
        to that form.

        If ``transformation`` is ``True``, then the output is a pair of
        matrices.  The first is the form ``Z`` and the second is an invertible
        matrix ``U`` such that ``U.inverse()*self*U`` equals ``Z``.  In other
        words, the representation of ``self`` with respect to the columns
        of ``U`` will be ``Z``.

        If subdivide is ``True`` then the matrix returned as the form is
        partitioned according to the companion matrices and these may be
        manipulated by several different matrix methods.

        For output that may be more useful as input to other routines,
        see the helper method :meth:`_zigzag_form`.

        .. NOTE::

            An effort has been made to optimize computation of the form,
            but no such work has been done for the computation of the
            transformation matrix, so for fastest results do not request the
            transformation matrix.

        ALGORITHM:

        ZigZag form, and its computation, are due to Arne Storjohann
        and are  described in [Sto2000]_ and
        [Sto1998]_, where the former is more
        representative of the code here.

        EXAMPLES:

        Two examples that illustrate ZigZag form well. Notice that this is
        *not* a canonical form.  The two matrices below are similar, since
        they have equal Jordan canonical forms, yet their ZigZag forms are
        quite different.  In other words, while the computation of the form
        is deterministic, the final result, when viewed as a property of a
        linear transformation, is dependent on the basis used for the
        matrix representation.  ::

        Two more examples, illustrating the two extremes of the zig-zag

        off-diagonal blocks, the second has all zeros in each off-diagonal
        block.  Notice again that the two matrices are similar, since their
        Jordan canonical forms are equal. ::

    def rational_form(self, format='right', subdivide=True):
        r"""
        Returns the rational canonical form, also known as Frobenius form.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` - a square matrix with entries from an exact field.

        - ``format`` - default: 'right' - one of 'right', 'bottom',
          'left', 'top' or 'invariants'.  The first four will cause a
          matrix to be returned with companion matrices dictated by the
          keyword.  The value 'invariants' will cause a list of lists to
          be returned, where each list contains coefficients of a
          polynomial associated with a companion matrix.

        - ``subdivide`` - default: 'True' - if 'True' and a matrix is
          returned, then it contains subdivisions delineating the
          companion matrices along the diagonal.

        OUTPUT:

        The rational form of a matrix is a similar matrix composed of
        submatrices ("blocks") placed on the main diagonal.  Each block
        is a companion matrix.  Associated with each companion matrix is a
        polynomial.  In rational form, the polynomial of one block will
        divide the polynomial of the next block (and thus, the polynomials
        of all subsequent blocks).

        Rational form, also known as Frobenius form, is a canonical form.
        In other words, two matrices are similar if and only if their
        rational canonical forms are equal.  The algorithm used does not
        provide the similarity transformation matrix (also known as the
        change-of-basis matrix).

        Companion matrices may be written in one of four styles, and any
        such style may be selected with the ``format`` keyword.  See the
        companion matrix constructor,
        :meth:`sage.matrix.constructor.companion_matrix`,
        for more information about companion matrices.

        If the 'invariants' value is used for the ``format`` keyword,
        then the return value is a list of lists, where each list is the
        coefficients of the polynomial associated with one of the companion
        matrices on the diagonal.  These coefficients include the leading
        one of the monic polynomial and are ready to be coerced into
        any polynomial ring over the same field (see examples of this below).
        This return value is intended to be the most compact representation
        and the easiest to use for testing equality of rational forms.

        Because the minimal and characteristic polynomials of a companion
        matrix are the associated polynomial, it is easy to see that the
        product of the polynomials of the blocks will be the characteristic
        polynomial and the final polynomial will be the minimal polynomial
        of the entire matrix.

        ALGORITHM:

        We begin with ZigZag form, which is due to Arne Storjohann
        and is documented at :meth:`zigzag_form`.  Then we eliminate
        ''corner'' entries enroute to rational form via an additional
        algorithm of Storjohann's [Sto2011]_.

        EXAMPLES:

        The lists of coefficients returned with the ``invariants`` keyword
        are designed to easily convert to the polynomials associated with
        the companion matrices.  This is illustrated by the construction
        below of the ``polys`` list.  Then we can test the divisibility
        condition on the list of polynomials. Also the minimal and
        characteristic polynomials are easy to determine from this list. ::

        Rational form is a canonical form.  Any two matrices are similar
        if and only if their rational forms are equal.  By starting with
        Jordan canonical forms, the matrices ``C`` and ``D`` below were
        built as similar matrices, while ``E`` was built to be just
        slightly different.  All three matrices have equal characteristic
        polynomials though ``E``'s minimal polynomial differs. ::

        The principal feature of rational canonical form is that it
        can be computed over any field using only field operations.  Other
        forms, such as Jordan canonical form, are complicated by the need to
        determine the eigenvalues of the matrix, which can lie outside
        the field.  The following matrix has all of its eigenvalues
        outside the rationals - some are irrational (`\pm\sqrt{2}`) and
        the rest are complex (`-1\pm 2i`).  ::

        Determine if this matrix is a positive operator on a cone.

        A matrix is a positive operator on a cone if the image of the
        cone under the matrix is itself a subset of the cone. That
        concept can be extended to two cones: a matrix is a positive
        operator on a pair of cones if the image of the first cone is
        contained in the second cone.

        To reliably check whether or not this matrix is a positive
        operator, its base ring must be either exact (for example, the
        rationals) or the symbolic ring. An exact ring is more reliable,
        but in some cases a matrix whose entries contain symbolic
        constants like `e` and `\pi` will work. Performance is best
        for integer or rational matrices, for which we can check the
        "is a subset of the other cone" condition quickly.

        INPUT:

        - ``K1`` -- a polyhedral closed convex cone.

        - ``K2`` -- (default: ``K1``) the codomain cone; this matrix is
          a positive operator if the image of ``K1`` is a subset of ``K2``.

        OUTPUT:

        If the base ring of this matrix is exact, then ``True`` will be
        returned if and only if this matrix is a positive operator.

        If the base ring of this matrix is symbolic, then the situation is
        more complicated:

        - ``True`` will be returned if it can be proven that this matrix
          is a positive operator.
        - ``False`` will be returned if it can be proven that this matrix
          is not a positive operator.
        - ``False`` will also be returned if we can't decide; specifically
          if we arrive at a symbolic inequality that cannot be resolved.

        all pairs of orthogonal vectors `x` in `K` and `s` in the dual

        Return the LLL transformation matrix for this Gram matrix.

        That is, the transformation matrix U over ZZ of determinant 1
        that transforms the lattice with this matrix as Gram matrix
        to a lattice that is LLL-reduced.

        Always works when ``self`` is positive definite,
        might work in some semidefinite and indefinite cases.

        INPUT:

        - ``self`` -- the Gram matrix of a quadratic form or of
          a lattice equipped with a bilinear form

        - ``flag`` -- an optional flag passed to ``qflllgram``.
          According  to :pari:`qflllgram`'s documentation the options are:

            - ``0`` -- (default), assume that ``self`` has either exact
              (integral or rational) or real floating point entries.
              The matrix is rescaled, converted to integers and the
              behavior is then as in ``flag=1``.

            - ``1`` -- assume that G is integral.
              Computations involving Gram-Schmidt vectors are
              approximate, with precision varying as needed.

        OUTPUT:

        A dense matrix ``U`` over the integers with determinant 1
        such that ``U.T * M * U`` is LLL-reduced.

        ALGORITHM:

        Calls PARI's :pari:`qflllgram`.

        EXAMPLES:

        Create a Gram matrix and LLL-reduce it::

            sage: M = Matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, [5, 3, 3, 2])
            sage: U = M.LLL_gram()
            sage: MM = U.transpose() * M * U

            [5 3]  [-1  1]  [1 0]
            [3 2], [ 1 -2], [0 1]
            )

        For a Gram matrix over RR with a length one first vector and
        a very short second vector, the LLL-reduced basis is obtained
        by swapping the two basis vectors (and changing sign to
        preserve orientation). ::

            sage: M = Matrix(RDF, 2, 2, [1, 0, 0, 1e-5])
            sage: M.LLL_gram()
            [ 0 -1]
            [ 1  0]

        The algorithm might work for some semidefinite and indefinite forms::

            sage: Matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, [2, 6, 6, 3]).LLL_gram()
            [-3 -1]
            [ 1  0]

            [ 0 -1]
            [ 1  0]

        However, it might fail for others, either raising a ``ValueError``::

            sage: Matrix(ZZ, 1, 1, [0]).LLL_gram()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
