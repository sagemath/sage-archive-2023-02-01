== Description ==

From http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc:
GNU MPC is a C library for the arithmetic of complex numbers with
arbitrarily high precision and correct rounding of the result. It
extends the principles of the IEEE-754 standard for fixed precision real
floating point numbers to complex numbers, providing well-defined
semantics for every operation. At the same time, speed of operation at
high precision is a major design goal.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

* mpc_mul_faster.patch: Patch from Paul Zimmermann to speed up MPC
  multiplication (for small precisions) by reducing overhead in MPFR
  operations.
