== Description ==

Tachyon is a raytracer developed by John E. Stone. Tachyon supports
the typical ray tracer features, most of the common geometric
primitives, shading and texturing modes, etc. It also supports less
common features such as HDR image output, ambient occlusion lighting,
and support for various triangle mesh and volumetric texture formats
beneficial for molecular visualization (e.g. rendering VMD scenes).

Currently not all of Tachyon's functionality is exported by the Sage
interface.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Delete the scenes directory, which has lots of cool examples.
 * Delete the msvc directory, which is also large and not used within Sage.
 * The CVS subdirectories are currently (almost) empty, but should
   otherwise be deleted.
 * The upstream files had strange permissions, i.e. some source files
   were executable, while almost all files weren't world-readable.
 * There's seems to be some crap like `tachyon.html.tar.gz` and a few
   `.#*` files I haven't [yet] deleted, since they're not that large.
 * TODO: Check whether building multi-threaded versions on MacOS X
         meanwhile works. (This was said to fail with an old beta.)
 * TODO: Use `patch` instead of copying over pre-patched files.
 * TODO: [Optionally] also install some of the documentation.
 * TODO: I doubt the CFLAGS set for AIX and HP-UX won't get overridden
         by the created Makefile, but that's a minor issue. -leif
