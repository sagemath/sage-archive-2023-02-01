Helper classes for structural embeddings and isomorphisms of number fields

Consider the following fields `L` and `M`::

    sage: L.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
    sage: M.<a> = L.absolute_field()

Both produce the same extension of `\QQ`. However, they should not be
identical because `M` carries additional information::

    sage: L.structure()
    (Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2,
     Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)
    sage: M.structure()
    (Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
      From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
      To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2,
     Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
      From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
      To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)

This used to cause trouble with caching and made (absolute) number fields not
unique when they should have been. The underlying technical problem is that the
morphisms returned by ``structure()`` can only be defined once the fields in
question have been created. Therefore, these morphisms cannot be part of a key
which uniquely identifies a number field.

The classes defined in this file encapsulate information about these structure
morphisms which can be passed to the factory creating number fields. This makes
it possible to distinguish number fields which only differ in terms of these
structure morphisms::

    sage: L is M
    False
    sage: N.<a> = L.absolute_field()
    sage: M is N
    True

    Abstract base class encapsulating information about a number fields

        Return a tuple encoding structural information about ``field``.

        OUTPUT:

        Typically, the output is a pair of morphisms. The first one from
        ``field`` to a field from which ``field`` has been constructed and the
        second one its inverse. In this case, these morphisms are used as
        conversion maps between the two fields.

        TESTS::

            sage: from sage.rings.number_field.structure import NumberFieldStructure

        The morphisms created by this method are used as conversion maps::

    Instances are cached through
    :class:`sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation`::

        sage: NumberFieldStructureFromUniqueField(QQ) is NumberFieldStructureFromUniqueField(QQ)
        True

    However, the caching (and the `==` operator of the objects) is on identity
    and not on equality::

        sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
        sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
        sage: L = K.change_names('j').change_names('i')
        sage: K == L

        True
        sage: NumberFieldStructureFromUniqueField(K) is NumberFieldStructureFromUniqueField(L)
        False

    This important because otherwise caching of number fields would be broken::

        sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
        sage: from sage.rings.number_field.structure import NameChange
        sage: KK.<j> = NumberField(x^2+1, structure=NameChange(K))
