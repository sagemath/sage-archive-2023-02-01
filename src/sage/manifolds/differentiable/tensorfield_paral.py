Tensor Fields with Values on a Parallelizable Manifold

The class :class:`TensorFieldParal` implements tensor fields along a
differentiable manifolds with values on a parallelizable differentiable
manifold. For non-parallelizable manifolds, see the class
:class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield.TensorField`.

Various derived classes of :class:`TensorFieldParal` are devoted to specific
tensor fields:

* :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.vectorfield.VectorFieldParal` for
  vector fields (rank-1 contravariant tensor fields)

* :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.automorphismfield.AutomorphismFieldParal`
  for fields of tangent-space automorphisms

* :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_form.DiffFormParal` for
  differential forms (fully antisymmetric covariant tensor fields)

EXAMPLES:

A tensor field of type `(1,1)` on a 2-dimensional differentiable manifold::

    sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', start_index=1)
    sage: c_xy.<x,y> = M.chart()
    sage: t = M.tensor_field(1, 1, 'T') ; t
    Tensor field T of type (1,1) on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
    sage: t.tensor_type()
    (1, 1)
    sage: t.tensor_rank()
    2

Components with respect to the manifold's default frame are created
by providing the relevant indices inside square brackets::

    sage: t[1,1] = x^2

Unset components are initialized to zero::

    sage: t[:]  # list of components w.r.t. the manifold's default vector frame
    [x^2   0]
    [  0   0]

The full set of components with respect to a given vector frame is
returned by the method
:meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield_paral.TensorFieldParal.comp`::

    sage: t.comp(c_xy.frame())
    2-indices components w.r.t. Coordinate frame (M, (d/dx,d/dy))

If no vector frame is mentioned in the argument of
:meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield_paral.TensorFieldParal.comp`,
it is assumed to be the manifold's default frame::

    sage: M.default_frame()
    Coordinate frame (M, (d/dx,d/dy))
    sage: t.comp() is t.comp(c_xy.frame())
    True

Individual components with respect to the manifold's default frame are
accessed by listing their indices inside double square brackets. They
are :class:`scalar fields
<sage.manifolds.differentiable.scalarfield.DiffScalarField>` on the manifold::

    sage: t[[1,1]]
    Scalar field on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
    sage: t[[1,1]].display()
    M --> R
    (x, y) |--> x^2
    sage: t[[1,2]]
    Scalar field zero on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
    sage: t[[1,2]].display()
    zero: M --> R
       (x, y) |--> 0

A direct access to the coordinate expression of some component is obtained
via the single square brackets::

    sage: t[1,1]
    x^2
    sage: t[1,1] is t[[1,1]].coord_function() # the coordinate function
    True
    sage: t[1,1] is t[[1,1]].coord_function(c_xy)
    True
    sage: t[1,1].expr() is t[[1,1]].expr() # the symbolic expression
    True

Expressions in a chart different from the manifold's default one are
obtained by specifying the chart as the last argument inside the
single square brackets::

    sage: c_uv.<u,v> = M.chart()
    sage: xy_to_uv = c_xy.transition_map(c_uv, [x+y, x-y])
    sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
    sage: t[1,1, c_uv]
    1/4*u^2 + 1/2*u*v + 1/4*v^2

Note that ``t[1,1, c_uv]`` is the component of the tensor ``t`` with respect
to the coordinate frame associated to the chart `(x,y)` expressed in terms of
the coordinates `(u,v)`. Indeed, ``t[1,1, c_uv]`` is a shortcut for
``t.comp(c_xy.frame())[[1,1]].coord_function(c_uv)``::

    sage: t[1,1, c_uv] is t.comp(c_xy.frame())[[1,1]].coord_function(c_uv)
    True

Similarly, ``t[1,1]`` is a shortcut for
``t.comp(c_xy.frame())[[1,1]].coord_function(c_xy)``::

    sage: t[1,1] is t.comp(c_xy.frame())[[1,1]].coord_function(c_xy)
    True
    sage: t[1,1] is t.comp()[[1,1]].coord_function()  # since c_xy.frame() and c_xy are the manifold's default values
    True

All the components can be set at once via ``[:]``::

    sage: t[:] = [[1, -x], [x*y, 2]]
    sage: t[:]
    [  1  -x]
    [x*y   2]

To set the components in a vector frame different from the manifold's
default one, the method
:meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield_paral.TensorFieldParal.set_comp`
can be employed::

    sage: e = M.vector_frame('e')
    sage: t.set_comp(e)[1,1] = x+y
    sage: t.set_comp(e)[2,1], t.set_comp(e)[2,2] = y, -3*x

but, as a shortcut, one may simply specify the frame as the first argument
of the square brackets::

    sage: t[e,1,1] = x+y
    sage: t[e,2,1], t[e,2,2] = y, -3*x
    sage: t.comp(e)
    2-indices components w.r.t. Vector frame (M, (e_1,e_2))
    sage: t.comp(e)[:]
    [x + y     0]
    [    y  -3*x]
    sage: t[e,:]  # a shortcut of the above
    [x + y     0]
    [    y  -3*x]

All the components in some frame can be set at once, via
the operator ``[:]``::

    sage: t[e,:] = [[x+y, 0], [y, -3*x]]
    sage: t[e,:]  # same as above:
    [x + y     0]
    [    y  -3*x]

To avoid any insconstency between the various components, the method
:meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield_paral.TensorFieldParal.set_comp`
clears the components in other frames.
To keep the other components, one must use the method
:meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield_paral.TensorFieldParal.add_comp`::

    sage: t = M.tensor_field(1, 1, 'T')  # Let us restart
    sage: t[:] = [[1, -x], [x*y, 2]]  # by first setting the components in the frame c_xy.frame()
    sage: # We now set the components in the frame e with add_comp:
    sage: t.add_comp(e)[:] = [[x+y, 0], [y, -3*x]]

The expansion of the tensor field in a given frame is obtained via the
method
:meth:`~sage.tensor.modules.free_module_tensor.FreeModuleTensor.display`
(the symbol ``*`` stands for tensor product)::

    sage: t.display()  # expansion in the manifold's default frame
    T = d/dx*dx - x d/dx*dy + x*y d/dy*dx + 2 d/dy*dy
    sage: t.display(e)
    T = (x + y) e_1*e^1 + y e_2*e^1 - 3*x e_2*e^2

By definition, a tensor field acts as a multilinear map on 1-forms and vector
fields; in the present case, ``T`` being of type `(1,1)`, it acts on pairs
(1-form, vector field)::

    sage: a = M.one_form('a')
    sage: a[:] = (1, x)
    sage: v = M.vector_field('V')
    sage: v[:] = (y, 2)
    sage: t(a,v)
    Scalar field T(a,V) on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
    sage: t(a,v).display()
    T(a,V): M --> R
       (x, y) |--> x^2*y^2 + 2*x + y
       (u, v) |--> 1/16*u^4 - 1/8*u^2*v^2 + 1/16*v^4 + 3/2*u + 1/2*v
    sage: latex(t(a,v))
    T\left(a,V\right)

Check by means of the component expression of ``t(a,v)``::

    sage: t(a,v).expr() - t[1,1]*a[1]*v[1] - t[1,2]*a[1]*v[2] \
    ....: - t[2,1]*a[2]*v[1] - t[2,2]*a[2]*v[2]
    0

A scalar field (rank-0 tensor field)::

    sage: f = M.scalar_field(x*y + 2, name='f') ; f
    Scalar field f on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
    sage: f.tensor_type()
    (0, 0)

A scalar field acts on points on the manifold::

    sage: p = M.point((1,2))
    sage: f(p)
    4

See :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.scalarfield.DiffScalarField` for
more details on scalar fields.

A vector field (rank-1 contravariant tensor field)::

    sage: v = M.vector_field('v') ; v
    Vector field v on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
    sage: v.tensor_type()
    (1, 0)
    sage: v[1], v[2] = -x, y
    sage: v.display()
    v = -x d/dx + y d/dy

A field of symmetric bilinear forms::

    sage: q = M.sym_bilin_form_field('Q') ; q
    Field of symmetric bilinear forms Q on the 2-dimensional differentiable
     manifold M
    sage: q.tensor_type()
    (0, 2)

The components of a symmetric bilinear form are dealt by the subclass
:class:`~sage.tensor.modules.comp.CompFullySym` of the class
:class:`~sage.tensor.modules.comp.Components`, which takes into
account the symmetry between the two indices::

    sage: q[1,1], q[1,2], q[2,2] = (0, -x, y) # no need to set the component (2,1)
    sage: type(q.comp())
    <class 'sage.tensor.modules.comp.CompFullySym'>
    sage: q[:] # note that the component (2,1) is equal to the component (1,2)
    [ 0 -x]
    [-x  y]
    sage: q.display()
    Q = -x dx*dy - x dy*dx + y dy*dy

More generally, tensor symmetries or antisymmetries can be specified via
the keywords ``sym`` and ``antisym``. For instance a rank-4 covariant
tensor symmetric with respect to its first two arguments (no. 0 and no. 1) and
antisymmetric with respect to its last two ones (no. 2 and no. 3) is declared
as follows::

    sage: t = M.tensor_field(0, 4, 'T', sym=(0,1), antisym=(2,3))
    sage: t[1,2,1,2] = 3
    sage: t[2,1,1,2] # check of the symmetry with respect to the first 2 indices
    3
    sage: t[1,2,2,1] # check of the antisymmetry with respect to the last 2 indices
    -3

class TensorFieldParal(FreeModuleTensor, TensorField):
    r"""
    Tensor field along a differentiable manifold, with values on a
    parallelizable manifold.

    An instance of this class is a tensor field along a differentiable
    manifold `U` with values on a parallelizable manifold `M`, via a
    differentiable map `\Phi: U \rightarrow M`. More precisely, given two
    non-negative integers `k` and `l` and a differentiable map

    .. MATH::

        \Phi:\ U \longrightarrow M,

    a *tensor field of type* `(k,l)` *along* `U` *with values on* `M` is
    a differentiable map

    .. MATH::

        t:\ U  \longrightarrow T^{(k,l)}M

    (where `T^{(k,l)}M` is the tensor bundle of type `(k,l)` over `M`) such
    that

    .. MATH::

        t(p) \in T^{(k,l)}(T_q M)

    for all `p \in U`, i.e. `t(p)` is a tensor of type `(k,l)` on the
    tangent space `T_q M` at the point `q=\Phi(p)`. That is to say
    a multilinear map

    .. MATH::

        t(p):\ \underbrace{T_q^*M\times\cdots\times T_q^*M}_{k\ \; \mbox{times}}
        \times \underbrace{T_q M\times\cdots\times T_q M}_{l\ \; \mbox{times}}
        \longrightarrow K,

    where `T_q^* M` is the dual vector space to `T_q M` and `K` is the
    topological field over which the manifold `M` is defined.
    The integer `k+l` is called the *tensor rank*.

    The standard case of a tensor field *on* a differentiable manifold
    corresponds to `U=M` and `\Phi = \mathrm{Id}_M`. Other common cases
    are `\Phi` being an immersion and `\Phi` being a curve in `M`
    (`U` is then an open interval of `\RR`).

    .. NOTE::

        If `M` is not parallelizable, the class
        :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield.TensorField`
        should be used instead.

    INPUT:

    - ``vector_field_module`` -- free module `\mathcal{X}(U,\Phi)` of vector
      fields along `U` associated with the map `\Phi: U \rightarrow M` (cf.
      :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.vectorfield_module.VectorFieldFreeModule`)
    - ``tensor_type`` -- pair `(k,l)` with `k` being the contravariant rank
      and `l` the covariant rank
    - ``name`` -- (default: ``None``) name given to the tensor field
    - ``latex_name`` -- (default: ``None``) LaTeX symbol to denote the tensor
      field; if none is provided, the LaTeX symbol is set to ``name``
    - ``sym`` -- (default: ``None``) a symmetry or a list of symmetries among
      the tensor arguments: each symmetry is described by a tuple containing
      the positions of the involved arguments, with the convention position=0
      for the first argument; for instance:

      * ``sym=(0,1)`` for a symmetry between the 1st and 2nd arguments
      * ``sym=[(0,2),(1,3,4)]`` for a symmetry between the 1st and 3rd
        arguments and a symmetry between the 2nd, 4th and 5th arguments

    - ``antisym`` -- (default: ``None``) antisymmetry or list of
      antisymmetries among the arguments, with the same convention
      as for ``sym``

    EXAMPLES:

    A tensor field of type `(2,0)` on a 3-dimensional parallelizable
    manifold::

        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M')
        sage: c_xyz.<x,y,z> = M.chart()  # makes M parallelizable
        sage: t = M.tensor_field(2, 0, 'T') ; t
        Tensor field T of type (2,0) on the 3-dimensional differentiable
         manifold M

    Tensor fields are considered as elements of a module over the ring
    `C^k(M)` of scalar fields on `M`::

        sage: t.parent()
        Free module T^(2,0)(M) of type-(2,0) tensors fields on the
         3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
        sage: t.parent().base_ring()
        Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 3-dimensional
         differentiable manifold M

    The components with respect to the manifold's default frame are
    set or read by means of square brackets::

        sage: e = M.vector_frame('e') ; M.set_default_frame(e)
        sage: for i in M.irange():
        ....:     for j in M.irange():
        ....:         t[i,j] = (i+1)**(j+1)
        ....:
        sage: [[ t[i,j] for j in M.irange()] for i in M.irange()]
        [[1, 1, 1], [2, 4, 8], [3, 9, 27]]

    A shortcut for the above is using ``[:]``::

        sage: t[:]
        [ 1  1  1]
        [ 2  4  8]
        [ 3  9 27]

    The components with respect to another frame are set via the method
    :meth:`set_comp` and read via the method :meth:`comp`; both return an
    instance of :class:`~sage.tensor.modules.comp.Components`::

        sage: f = M.vector_frame('f')  # a new frame defined on M, in addition to e
        sage: t.set_comp(f)[0,0] = -3
        sage: t.comp(f)
        2-indices components w.r.t. Vector frame (M, (f_0,f_1,f_2))
        sage: t.comp(f)[0,0]
        -3
        sage: t.comp(f)[:]  # the full list of components
        [-3  0  0]
        [ 0  0  0]
        [ 0  0  0]

    To avoid any insconstency between the various components, the method
    :meth:`set_comp` deletes the components in other frames.
    Accordingly, the components in the frame ``e`` have been deleted::

        sage: t._components
        {Vector frame (M, (f_0,f_1,f_2)): 2-indices components w.r.t. Vector
         frame (M, (f_0,f_1,f_2))}

    To keep the other components, one must use the method :meth:`add_comp`::

        sage: t = M.tensor_field(2, 0, 'T')  # Let us restart
        sage: t[0,0] = 2                     # sets the components in the frame e
        sage: # We now set the components in the frame f with add_comp:
        sage: t.add_comp(f)[0,0] = -3
        sage: # The components w.r.t. frame e have been kept:
        sage: t._components  # random (dictionary output)
        {Vector frame (M, (e_0,e_1,e_2)): 2-indices components w.r.t. Vector frame (M, (e_0,e_1,e_2)),
         Vector frame (M, (f_0,f_1,f_2)): 2-indices components w.r.t. Vector frame (M, (f_0,f_1,f_2))}

    The basic properties of a tensor field are::

        sage: t.domain()
        3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
        sage: t.tensor_type()
        (2, 0)

    Symmetries and antisymmetries are declared via the keywords ``sym`` and
    ``antisym``. For instance, a rank-6 covariant tensor that is symmetric
    with respect to its 1st and 3rd arguments and antisymmetric with respect
    to the 2nd, 5th and 6th arguments is set up as follows::

        sage: a = M.tensor_field(0, 6, 'T', sym=(0,2), antisym=(1,4,5))
        sage: a[0,0,1,0,1,2] = 3
        sage: a[1,0,0,0,1,2] # check of the symmetry
        3
        sage: a[0,1,1,0,0,2], a[0,1,1,0,2,0] # check of the antisymmetry
        (-3, 3)

    Multiple symmetries or antisymmetries are allowed; they must then be
    declared as a list. For instance, a rank-4 covariant tensor that is
    antisymmetric with respect to its 1st and 2nd arguments and with
    respect to its 3rd and 4th argument must be declared as::

        sage: r = M.tensor_field(0, 4, 'T', antisym=[(0,1), (2,3)])
        sage: r[0,1,2,0] = 3
        sage: r[1,0,2,0] # first antisymmetry
        -3
        sage: r[0,1,0,2] # second antisymmetry
        -3
        sage: r[1,0,0,2] # both antisymmetries acting
        3

    Tensor fields of the same type can be added and subtracted::

        sage: a = M.tensor_field(2, 0)
        sage: a[0,0], a[0,1], a[0,2] = (1,2,3)
        sage: b = M.tensor_field(2, 0)
        sage: b[0,0], b[1,1], b[2,2], b[0,2] = (4,5,6,7)
        sage: s = a + 2*b ; s
        Tensor field of type (2,0) on the 3-dimensional differentiable
         manifold M
        sage: a[:], (2*b)[:], s[:]
        (
        [1 2 3]  [ 8  0 14]  [ 9  2 17]
        [0 0 0]  [ 0 10  0]  [ 0 10  0]
        [0 0 0], [ 0  0 12], [ 0  0 12]
        )
        sage: s = a - b ; s
        Tensor field of type (2,0) on the 3-dimensional differentiable
         manifold M
        sage: a[:], b[:], s[:]
        (
        [1 2 3]  [4 0 7]  [-3  2 -4]
        [0 0 0]  [0 5 0]  [ 0 -5  0]
        [0 0 0], [0 0 6], [ 0  0 -6]
        )

    Symmetries are preserved by the addition whenever it is possible::

        sage: a = M.tensor_field(2, 0, sym=(0,1))
        sage: a[0,0], a[0,1], a[0,2] = (1,2,3)
        sage: s = a + b
        sage: a[:], b[:], s[:]
        (
        [1 2 3]  [4 0 7]  [ 5  2 10]
        [2 0 0]  [0 5 0]  [ 2  5  0]
        [3 0 0], [0 0 6], [ 3  0  6]
        )
        sage: a.symmetries()
        symmetry: (0, 1);  no antisymmetry
        sage: b.symmetries()
        no symmetry;  no antisymmetry
        sage: s.symmetries()
        no symmetry;  no antisymmetry
        sage: # let us now make b symmetric:
        sage: b = M.tensor_field(2, 0, sym=(0,1))
        sage: b[0,0], b[1,1], b[2,2], b[0,2] = (4,5,6,7)
        sage: s = a + b
        sage: a[:], b[:], s[:]
        (

        EXAMPLES:

        Display of the components of a type-`(2,1)` tensor field on a
        2-dimensional manifold::

            sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')

        By default, only the non-vanishing components are displayed;
        to see all the components, the argument ``only_nonzero`` must

            t^xx_x = x + y
            t^xy_x = x*y
            t^yy_y = -3

        Instead of coordinate labels, one may ask for integers::

            t^vv_v = -1/4*u^2 + 1/4*v^2 + 1/2*u + 3/2

        Note that the frame defining the components is the coordinate frame
