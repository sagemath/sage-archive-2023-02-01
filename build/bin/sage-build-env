#  NOTES:
#  - You must *source* this script instead of executing.
#  - Use "return" instead of "exit" to signal a failure.  Since this
#    file is sourced, an "exit" here will actually exit src/bin/sage,
#    which is probably not intended.
#  - All environment variables set here should be *exported*, otherwise
#    they won't be available in child programs.
#
#  If you want to set all environment variables for your shell like
#  they are during the build of Sage packages, type
#
#             sage --buildsh
