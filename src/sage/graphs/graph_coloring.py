def all_graph_colorings(G,n,count_only=False, hex_colors=False, vertex_color_dict=False):
    r"""
    Computes all `n`-colorings of the graph `G` by casting the graph
    coloring problem into an exact cover problem, and passing this
    into an implementation of the Dancing Links algorithm described
    by Knuth (who attributes the idea to Hitotumatu and Noshita).

    INPUT:

    * ``G`` - a graph

    * ``n`` - a positive integer the number of colors

    * `count_only` -- (default: ``False``) when set to ``True``, it returns 1
       for each coloring

    * `hex_colors` -- (default: ``False``) when set to ``False``, it labels
      the colors [0,1,..,``n``-1], otherwise it uses the RGB Hex labeling

    * `vertex_color_dict` -- (default: ``False``) when set to ``True``, it
      returns a dictionary {vertex:color}, otherwise it returns a dictionary
      {color:[list of vertices]}

    The construction works as follows. Columns:

    * The first `|V|` columns correspond to a vertex -- a `1` in this
      column indicates that that vertex has a color.

    * After those `|V|` columns, we add `n*|E|` columns -- a `1` in
      these columns indicate that a particular edge is
      incident to a vertex with a certain color.

    Rows:

    * For each vertex, add `n` rows; one for each color `c`.  Place
      a `1` in the column corresponding to the vertex, and a `1`
      in the appropriate column for each edge incident to the
      vertex, indicating that that edge is incident to the
      color `c`.

    * If `n > 2`, the above construction cannot be exactly covered
      since each edge will be incident to only two vertices
      (and hence two colors) - so we add `n*|E|` rows, each one
      containing a `1` for each of the `n*|E|` columns.  These
      get added to the cover solutions "for free" during the
      backtracking.

    Note that this construction results in `n*|V| + 2*n*|E| + n*|E|`
    entries in the matrix.  The Dancing Links algorithm uses a
    sparse representation, so if the graph is simple, `|E| \leq |V|^2`
    and `n <= |V|`, this construction runs in `O(|V|^3)` time.
    Back-conversion to a coloring solution is a simple scan of the
    solutions, which will contain `|V| + (n-2)*|E|` entries,  so
    runs in `O(|V|^3)` time also.  For most graphs, the conversion
    will be much faster -- for example, a planar graph will be
    transformed for `4`-coloring in linear time since `|E| = O(|V|)`.

    r"""
    Computes the chromatic number of the given graph or tests its
    `k`-colorability. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring for
    further details on graph coloring.

    INPUT:

    - ``g`` -- a graph.

    - ``k`` -- (default: ``None``) tests whether the graph is `k`-colorable.
      The function returns a partition of the vertex set in `k` independent
      sets if possible and ``False`` otherwise.

    - ``value_only`` -- (default: ``False``):

      - When set to ``True``, only the chromatic number is returned.

      - When set to ``False`` (default), a partition of the vertex set into
        independent sets is returned if possible.

    - ``hex_colors`` -- (default: ``False``) when set to ``True``, the
      partition returned is a dictionary whose keys are colors and whose
      values are the color classes (ideal for plotting).

    - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
      solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is
      used. For more information on LP solvers and which default
      solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the
      class :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
       verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.


    OUTPUT:

    - If ``k=None`` and ``value_only=False``, then return a partition of the
      vertex set into the minimum possible of independent sets.

    - If ``k=None`` and ``value_only=True``, return the chromatic number.

    - If ``k`` is set and ``value_only=None``, return ``False`` if the
      graph is not `k`-colorable, and a partition of the vertex set into
      `k` independent sets otherwise.

    - If ``k`` is set and ``value_only=True``, test whether the graph is
      `k`-colorable, and return ``True`` or ``False`` accordingly.

    r"""
    Computes the worst-case of a first-fit coloring with less than `k`
    colors.

    Definition :

    A first-fit coloring is obtained by sequentially coloring the
    vertices of a graph, assigning them the smallest color not already
    assigned to one of its neighbors. The result is clearly a proper
    coloring, which usually requires much more colors than an optimal
    vertex coloring of the graph, and heavily depends on the ordering
    of the vertices.

    The number of colors required by the worst-case application of
    this algorithm on a graph `G` is called the Grundy number, written
    `\Gamma (G)`.

    Equivalent formulation :

    Equivalently, a Grundy coloring is a proper vertex coloring such
    that any vertex colored with `i` has, for every `j<i`, a neighbor
    colored with `j`. This can define a Linear Program, which is used
    here to compute the Grundy number of a graph.

    .. NOTE:

       This method computes a grundy coloring using at *MOST* `k`
       colors. If this method returns a value equal to `k`, it can not
       be assumed that `k` is equal to `\Gamma(G)`. Meanwhile, if it
       returns any value `k' < k`, this is a certificate that the
       Grundy number of the given graph is `k'`.

       As `\Gamma(G)\leq \Delta(G)+1`, it can also be assumed that
       `\Gamma(G) = k` if ``grundy_coloring(g, k)`` returns `k` when
       `k = \Delta(G) +1`.

    INPUT:

    - ``k`` (integer) -- Maximum number of colors

    - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP)
      solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For
      more information on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see

      :meth:`solve <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>`
      of the class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``value_only`` -- boolean (default: ``True``). When set to
      ``True``, only the number of colors is returned. Otherwise, the
      pair ``(nb_colors, coloring)`` is returned, where ``coloring``
      is a dictionary associating its color (integer) to each vertex
      of the graph.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of
      verbosity. Set to 0 by default, which means quiet.

def b_coloring(g, k, value_only = True, solver = None, verbose = 0):
    r"""
    Computes a b-coloring with at most k colors that maximizes the
    number of colors, if such a coloring exists

    Definition :

    Given a proper coloring of a graph `G` and a color class `C` such
    that none of its vertices have neighbors in all the other color
    classes, one can eliminate color class `C` assigning to each of
    its elements a missing color in its neighborhood.

    Let a b-vertex be a vertex with neighbors in all other colorings.
    Then, one can repeat the above procedure until a coloring
    is obtained where every color class contains a b-vertex,
    in which case none of the color classes can be eliminated
    with the same ideia.  So, one can define a b-coloring as a
    proper coloring where each color class has a b-vertex.

    In the worst case, after successive applications of the above procedure,
    one get a proper coloring that uses a number of colors equal to the
    the b-chromatic number of `G` (denoted `\chi_b(G)`):
    the maximum `k` such that `G` admits a b-coloring with `k` colors.

    An useful upper bound for calculating the b-chromatic number is
    the following. If G admits a b-coloring with k colors, then there
    are `k` vertices of degree at least `k - 1` (the b-vertices of
    each color class). So, if we set `m(G) = max` \{`k | `there are
    k vertices of degree at least `k - 1`\}, we have that `\chi_b(G)
    \leq m(G)`.


    .. NOTE::

       This method computes a b-coloring that uses at *MOST* `k`
       colors. If this method returns a value equal to `k`, it can not
       be assumed that `k` is equal to `\chi_b(G)`. Meanwhile, if it
       returns any value `k' < k`, this is a certificate that the
       Grundy number of the given graph is `k'`.

       As `\chi_b(G)\leq m(G)`, it can be assumed that
       `\chi_b(G) = k` if ``b_coloring(g, k)`` returns `k` when
       `k = m(G)`.

      - When set to ``False``, a partition of the edge set into

    - If ``vizing=False`` and ``value_only=True``, return the chromatic index.

    - If ``vizing=False`` and ``value_only=False``, return a partition of
      the edge set into the minimum number of matchings.

    - If ``vizing=True`` and ``value_only=True``, should return something,
      but mainly you are just trying to compute the maximum degree of the
      graph, and this is not the easiest way. By Vizing's theorem, a graph
      has a chromatic index equal to `\Delta` or to `\Delta + 1`.

    .. NOTE::

       In a few cases, it is possible to find very quickly the chromatic
       index of a graph, while it remains a tedious job to compute
       a corresponding coloring. For this reason, ``value_only = True``
       can sometimes be much faster, and it is a bad idea to compute
       the whole coloring if you do not need it !

    Computes a round-robin coloring of the complete graph on `n` vertices.

    A round-robin coloring of the complete graph `G` on `2n` vertices
    (`V = [0, \dots, 2n - 1]`) is a proper coloring of its edges such that
    the edges with color `i` are all the `(i + j, i - j)` plus the
    edge `(2n - 1, i)`.

    If `n` is odd, one obtain a round-robin coloring of the complete graph
    through the round-robin coloring of the graph with `n + 1` vertices.

    INPUT:

    - ``n`` -- the number of vertices in the complete graph.

    The linear arboricity of a graph `G` is the least number `la(G)` such that
    the edges of `G` can be partitioned into linear forests (i.e. into forests
    of paths).

    Obviously, `la(G)\geq \lceil \frac {\Delta(G)} 2 \rceil`.

    It is conjectured in [Aki80]_ that `la(G)\leq \lceil \frac {\Delta(G)+1} 2

        - If ``hex_colors = False`` (default value), returns
          a list of graphs corresponding to each color class.

    - ``value_only`` (boolean)

        - If ``value_only = True``, only returns the linear
          arboricity as an integer value.

        - If ``0``, computes a decomposition of `G` into `\lceil \frac
          {\Delta(G)} 2 \rceil` forests of paths

        - If ``1``, computes a decomposition of `G` into `\lceil \frac
          {\Delta(G)+1} 2 \rceil` colors, which is the conjectured general
          bound.

        - If ``plus_one = None`` (default), computes a decomposition using the
          least possible number of colors.

    - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Linear Program (LP) solver to
      be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For more information
      on LP solvers and which default solver is used, see the method

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``). Sets the level of verbosity. Set
       to 0 by default, which means quiet.

    COMPLEXITY:

    Of maximum degree 2::

        sage: max(g1.degree()) <= 2 and max(g2.degree()) <= 2

    Computes an acyclic edge coloring of the current graph.

    An edge coloring of a graph is a assignment of colors
    to the edges of a graph such that :

    - the coloring is proper (no adjacent edges share a
      color)
    - For any two colors `i,j`, the union of the edges
      colored with `i` or `j` is a forest.

    The least number of colors such that such a coloring
    exists for a graph `G` is written `\chi'_a(G)`, also
    called the acyclic chromatic index of `G`.

    It is conjectured that this parameter can not be too different
    from the obvious lower bound `\Delta(G)\leq \chi'_a(G)`,
    `\Delta(G)` being the maximum degree of `G`, which is given
    by the first of the two constraints. Indeed, it is conjectured
    that `\Delta(G)\leq \chi'_a(G) \leq \Delta(G) + 2`.

    EXAMPLE:

        sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(8)

    Each color class is of course a matching ::

        sage: all([max(gg.degree())<=1 for gg in colors])

    These matchings being a partition of the edge set::

        sage: all([ any([gg.has_edge(e) for gg in colors]) for e in g.edges(labels = False)])
