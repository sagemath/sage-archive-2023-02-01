    The canonical embedding from the symmetric group algebra of order
    `n` to the symmetric group algebra of order `p > n` is available as
    a coercion::

        sage: QS3 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)

        sage: QS4.coerce_map_from(QS3)

        sage: QS4(x3)
        2*[2, 3, 1, 4] + [3, 1, 2, 4]

    This allows for mixed expressions::

        sage: x3 + x4

    Caveat: to achieve this, constructing ``SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ,
    10)`` currently triggers the construction of all symmetric group
    algebras of smaller order. Is this a feature we really want to have?

    .. WARNING::

        The semantics of multiplication in symmetric group algebras is
        determined by the order in which permutations are multiplied,
        which currently defaults to "in such a way that multiplication
        is associative with permutations acting on integers from the
        right", but can be changed to the opposite order at runtime
        by setting a global variable (see
        :meth:`sage.combinat.permutation.Permutations.global_options` ).
        In view of this, it is recommended that code not rely on the
        usual multiplication function, but rather use the methods
        :meth:`left_action_product` and :meth:`right_action_product`
        for multiplying permutations (these methods don't depend on the
        setting). See :trac:`14885` for more information.

        Return the `k`-th Reiner-Saliola-Welker shuffling element in
        the group algebra ``self``.

        The `k`-th Reiner-Saliola-Welker shuffling element in the
        symmetric group algebra `R S_n` over a ring `R` is defined as the
        sum `\sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \mathrm{noninv}_k(\sigma) \cdot \sigma`,
        where for every permutation `\sigma`, the number
        `\mathrm{noninv}_k(\sigma)` is the number of all
        `k`-noninversions of `\sigma` (that is, the number of all
        `k`-element subsets of `\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}` on which
        `\sigma` restricts to a strictly increasing map). See
        :meth:`sage.combinat.permutation.number_of_noninversions` for
        the `\mathrm{noninv}` map.

        This element is more or less the operator `\nu_{k, 1^{n-k}}`
        introduced in [RSW2011]_; more precisely, `\nu_{k, 1^{n-k}}`
        is the left multiplication by this element.

        It is a nontrivial theorem (Theorem 1.1 in [RSW2011]_) that
        the operators `\nu_{k, 1^{n-k}}` (for fixed `n` and varying
        `k`) pairwise commute. It is a conjecture (Conjecture 1.2 in
        [RSW2011]_) that all their eigenvalues are integers (which, in
        light of their commutativity and easily established symmetry,
        yields that they can be simultaneously diagonalized over `\QQ`
        with only integer eigenvalues).

def HeckeAlgebraSymmetricGroupT(R, n, q=None):
    r"""
    Return the Hecke algebra of the symmetric group `S_n` on the T-basis
    with quantum parameter ``q`` over the ring `R`.

    If `R` is a commutative ring and `q` is an invertible element of `R`,
    and if `n` is a nonnegative integer, then the Hecke algebra of the
    symmetric group `S_n` over `R` with quantum parameter `q` is defined
    as the algebra generated by the generators `T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_{n-1}`
    with relations

    .. MATH::

        T_i T_{i+1} T_i = T_{i+1} T_i T_{i+1}

    for all `i < n-1` ("braid relations"),

    .. MATH::

        T_i T_j = T_j T_i

    for all `i` and `j` such that `| i-j | > 1` ("locality relations"),
    and

    .. MATH::

        T_i^2 = q + (q-1) T_i

    for all `i` (the "quadratic relations", also known in the form
    `(T_i + 1) (T_i - q) = 0`). (This is only one of several existing
    definitions in literature, not all of which are fully equivalent.
    We are following the conventions of [GS93]_.) For any permutation
    `w \in S_n`, we can define an element `T_w` of this Hecke algebra by
    setting `T_w = T_{i_1} T_{i_2} \cdots T_{i_k}`, where
    `w = s_{i_1} s_{i_2} \cdots s_{i_k}` is a reduced word for `w`
    (with `s_i` meaning the transposition `(i, i+1)`, and the product of
    permutations being evaluated by first applying `s_{i_k}`, then
    `s_{i_{k-1}}`, etc.). This element is independent of the choice of
    the reduced decomposition, and can be computed in Sage by calling
    ``H[w]`` where ``H`` is the Hecke algebra and ``w`` is the
    permutation.

    The Hecke algebra of the symmetric group `S_n` with quantum parameter
    `q` over `R` can be seen as a deformation of the group algebra
    `R S_n`; indeed, it becomes `R S_n` when `q = 1`.

    .. WARNING::

        The multiplication on the Hecke algebra of the symmetric group
        does *not* follow the global option ``mult`` of the
        :class:`Permutations` class (see
        :meth:`~sage.combinat.permutation.Permutations.global_options`).
        It is always as defined above. It does not match the default
        option (``mult=l2r``) of the symmetric group algebra!
