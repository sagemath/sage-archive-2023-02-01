Rank Decompositions of graphs

This modules wraps a C code from Philipp Klaus Krause computing a an optimal
rank-decomposition [RWKlause]_.

**Definitions :**

Given a graph `G` and a subset `S\subseteq V(G)` of vertices, the *rank-width*
of `S` in `G`, denoted `rw_G(S)`, is equal to the rank in `GF(2)` of the `|S|
\times (|V|-|S|)` matrix of the adjacencies between the vertices of `S` and
`V\backslash S`. By definition, `rw_G(S)` is qual to `rw_G(\overline S)` where
`\overline S` is the complement of `S` in `V(G)`.

A *rank-decomposition* of `G` is a tree whose `n` leaves are the elements of
`V(G)`, and whose internal noes have degree 3. In a tree, ay edge naturally
corresponds to a bipartition of the vertex set : indeed, the reoal of any edge
splits the tree into two connected components, thus splitting the set of leaves
(i.e. vertices of `G`) into two sets. Hence we can define for any edge `e\in
E(G)` a width equal to the value `rw_G(S)` or `rw_G(\overline S)`, where
`S,\overline S` is the bipartition obtained from `e`. The *rank-width*
associated to the whole decomposition is then set to the maximum of the width of
all the edges it contains.

A *rank-decomposition* is said to be optimal for `G` if it is the decomposition
achieving the minimal *rank-width*.

**RW -- The original source code :**

RW [RWKlause]_ is a program that calculates rank-width and
rank-decompositions. It is based on ideas from :

    * "Computing rank-width exactly" by Sang-il Oum [Oum]_
    * "Sopra una formula numerica" by Ernesto Pascal
    * "Generation of a Vector from the Lexicographical Index" by B.P. Buckles and M. Lybanon [BL]_
    * "Fast additions on masked integers" by Michael D. Adams and David S. Wise [AW]_

**OUTPUT:**

The rank decomposition is returned as a tree whose vertices are subsets of
`V(G)`. Its leaves, corresponding to the vertices of `G` are sets of 1 elements,
i.e. singletons.

::

    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: rw, tree = g.rank_decomposition()
    sage: all(len(v)==1 for v in tree if tree.degree(v) == 1)
    True

The internal nodes are sets of the decomposition. This way, it is easy to deduce
the bipartition associated to an edge from the tree. Indeed, two adjacent
vertices of the tree are comarable sets : they yield the bipartition obtained
from the smaller of the two and its complement.

::

    sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
    sage: rw, tree = g.rank_decomposition()
    sage: u = Set([8, 9, 3, 7])
    sage: v = Set([8, 9])
    sage: tree.has_edge(u,v)
    True
    sage: m = min(u,v)
    sage: bipartition = (m, Set(g.vertices()) - m)
    sage: bipartition
    ({8, 9}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7})

.. WARNING::

    * The current implementation cannot handle graphs of `\geq 32` vertices.

    * A bug that has been reported upstream make the code crash immediately on
      instances of size `30`. If you experience this kind of bug please report
      it to us, what we need is some information on the hardware you run to know
      where it comes from !

EXAMPLE::

        sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: g.rank_decomposition()
        (3, Graph on 19 vertices)

    Computes an optimal rank-decomposition of the given graph.

    This function is available as a method of the :class:`Graph
    <sage.graphs.graph>` class. See :meth:`rank_decomposition

    INPUT:

    - ``verbose`` (boolean) -- whether to display progress information while
      computing the decomposition.

    A pair ``(rankwidth, decomposition_tree)``, where ``rankwidth`` is a
    numerical value and ``decomposition_tree`` is a ternary tree describing the
    decomposition (cf. the module's documentation).
