List of faces

This module provides a class to store faces of a polyhedron in Bit-representation.

This class allocates memory to store the faces in.
A face will be stored as vertex-incidences, where each Bit represents an incidence.
In :mod:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.conversions` there a methods to actually convert facets of a polyhedron
to bit-representations of vertices stored in :class:`ListOfFaces`.

Moreover, :class:`ListOfFaces` calculates the dimension of a polyhedron, assuming the
faces are the facets of this polyhedron.

Each face is stored over-aligned according to the ``chunktype``.

.. SEEALSO::

    :mod:`sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.base`.

EXAMPLES:

Provide enough space to store `20` faces as incidences to `60` vertices::

    sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.list_of_faces \
    ....: import ListOfFaces
    sage: face_list = ListOfFaces(20, 60)

Obtain the facets of a polyhedron::

    sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.conversions \
    ....:         import incidence_matrix_to_bit_rep_of_facets
    sage: P = polytopes.cube()
    sage: face_list = incidence_matrix_to_bit_rep_of_facets(P.incidence_matrix())
    sage: face_list = incidence_matrix_to_bit_rep_of_facets(P.incidence_matrix())
    sage: face_list.compute_dimension()
    3

Obtain the Vrepresentation of a polyhedron as facet-incidences::

    sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.conversions \
    ....:         import incidence_matrix_to_bit_rep_of_Vrep
    sage: P = polytopes.associahedron(['A',3])
    sage: face_list = incidence_matrix_to_bit_rep_of_Vrep(P.incidence_matrix())
    sage: face_list.compute_dimension()
    3

Obtain the facets of a polyhedron as :class:`ListOfFaces` from a facet list::

    sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.conversions \
    ....:         import facets_tuple_to_bit_rep_of_facets
    sage: facets = ((0,1,2), (0,1,3), (0,2,3), (1,2,3))
    sage: face_list = facets_tuple_to_bit_rep_of_facets(facets, 4)

Likewise for the Vrepresentatives as facet-incidences::

    sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.conversions \
    ....:         import facets_tuple_to_bit_rep_of_Vrep
    sage: facets = ((0,1,2), (0,1,3), (0,2,3), (1,2,3))
    sage: face_list = facets_tuple_to_bit_rep_of_Vrep(facets, 4)

Obtain the matrix of a list of faces::

    sage: face_list.matrix()
    [1 1 1 0]
    [1 1 0 1]
    [1 0 1 1]
    [0 1 1 1]

#        ALGORITHM:

#        To get all facets of ``faces[n_faces-1]``, we would have to:
#        - Intersect the first ``n_faces-1`` faces of ``faces`` with the last face.
#        - Add all the intersection of ``visited_all`` with the last face
#        - Out of both the inclusion-maximal ones are of codimension 1, i.e. facets.

#        As we have visited all faces of ``visited_all``, we alter the algorithm
#        to not revisit:
#        Step 1: Intersect the first ``n_faces-1`` faces of ``faces`` with the last face.
#        Step 2: Out of thosse the inclusion-maximal ones are some of the facets.
#                At least we obtain all of those, that we have not already visited.
#                Maybe, we get some more.
#        Step 3: Only keep those that we have not already visited.
#                We obtain exactly the facets of ``faces[n_faces-1]`` that we have
#                not visited yet.

        ALGORITHM:

        This is done by iteration:

        Computes the facets of one of the facets (i.e. the ridges contained in
        one of the facets). Then computes the dimension of the facet, by
        considering its facets.

        Repeats until a face has only one facet. Usually this is a vertex.

        However, in the unbounded case, this might be different. The face with only
        one facet might be a ray or a line. So the correct dimension of a
        polyhedron with one facet is the number of ``[lines, rays, vertices]``
        that the facet contains.

        Hence, we know the dimension of a face, which has only one facet and
        iteratively we know the dimension of entire polyhedron we started from.
