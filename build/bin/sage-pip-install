# name.  That is, it is for pip-installing Sage spkgs from their
# extracted upstream sources.

# This ensures that any previous installations of the same package
# are uninstalled first.

# Default arguments for all packages installed with `pip install`
# --ignore-installed : Force pip to re-install package even if it thinks it's
#                      already installed (for which it sometimes gets false
#                      positives for partially-installed packages).
# --verbose          : Display the output when running setup.py.
# --no-deps          : Don't install runtime dependencies from PyPI.
# --no-index         : Don't look at the package index.
#                      This also disables pip's version self-check.
