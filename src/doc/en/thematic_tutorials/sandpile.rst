Introduction
------------

These notes provide an introduction to Dhar's abelian sandpile model (ASM) and
to Sage Sandpiles, a collection of tools in Sage for doing sandpile
calculations.  For a more thorough introduction to the theory of the ASM, the
papers *Chip-Firing and Rotor-Routing on Directed Graphs* [H]_, by Holroyd et
al. and *Riemann-Roch and Abel-Jacobi Theory on a Finite Graph* by Baker and
Norine [BN]_ are recommended.

To describe the ASM, we start with a *sandpile graph*: a directed multigraph
`\Gamma` with a vertex `s` that is accessible from every vertex (except
possibly `s`, itself).  By *multigraph*, we mean that each edge of `\Gamma` is
assigned a nonnegative integer weight.  To say `s` is *accessible* from some
vertex `v` means that there is a sequence of directed edges starting at `v` and
ending at `s`.  We call `s` the *sink* of the sandpile graph, even though it might have outgoing edges, for reasons that will be made clear in a moment.

We denoted the vertices of `\Gamma` by `V` and define `\tilde{V} = V\setminus\{s\}`.

Configurations and divisors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *configuration* on `\Gamma` is an element of `\mathbb{N}\tilde{V}`, i.e., the
assignment of a nonnegative integer to each nonsink vertex.  We think of each
integer as a number of grains of sand being placed at the corresponding
vertex.  A *divisor* on `\Gamma` is an element of `\mathbb{Z}V`, i.e., an
element in the free abelian group on *all* of the vertices.  In the context of
divisors, it is sometimes useful to think of assigning dollars to each vertex,
with negative integers signifying a debt.

Stabilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A configuration `c` is *stable* at a vertex `v\in\tilde{V}` if
`c(v)<\mbox{out-degree}(v)`, and `c` itself is stable if it is stable at each
nonsink vertex.  Otherwise, `c` is *unstable*.  If `c` is unstable at `v`, the vertex `v` can be *fired*
(*toppled*) by removing `\mbox{out-degree}(v)` grains of sand from `v` and
adding grains of sand to the neighbors of sand, determined by the weights of
the edges leaving `v`.

Despite our best intentions, we sometimes consider firing a stable vertex,
resulting in a configuration with a "negative amount" of sand at that vertex.
We may also *reverse-firing* a vertex, absorbing sand from the vertex's
neighbors.

**Example.** Consider the graph:

.. figure:: media/sandpile/example1.png
   :align: center

   `\Gamma`


All edges have weight `1` except for the edge from vertex 1 to vertex 3,
which has weight `2`.  If we let `c=(5,0,1)` with the indicated number of
grains of sand on vertices 1, 2, and 3, respectively, then only vertex 1,
whose out-degree is 4, is unstable.  Firing vertex 1 gives a new
configuration `c'=(1,1,3)`.  Here, `4` grains have left vertex 1.  One of
these has gone to the sink vertex (and forgotten), one has gone to vertex 1,
and two have gone to vertex 2, since the edge from 1 to 2 has weight 2.
Vertex 3 in the new configuration is now unstable.  The Sage code for this
example follows. ::

    sage: g = {'sink':{},
    ....:      1:{'sink':1, 2:1, 3:2},
    ....:      2:{1:1, 3:1},
    ....:      3:{1:1, 2:1}}
    sage: S = Sandpile(g, 'sink')   # create the sandpile
    sage: S.show(edge_labels=true)  # display the graph

    Create the configuration:

    sage: c = SandpileConfig(S, {1:5, 2:0, 3:1})
    sage: S.out_degree()
    {1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 2, 'sink': 0}

    Fire vertex one:

    sage: c.fire_vertex(1)
    {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 3}

    The configuration is unchanged:

    sage: c
    {1: 5, 2: 0, 3: 1}

    Repeatedly fire vertices until the configuration becomes stable:

    sage: c.stabilize()
    {1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}

    Alternatives:

    sage: ~c             # shorthand for c.stabilize()
    {1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}
    sage: c.stabilize(with_firing_vector=true)
    [{1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}, {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 3}]



Since vertex 3 has become unstable after firing vertex 1, it can be fired,
which causes vertex 2 to become unstable, etc.  Repeated firings eventually
lead to a stable configuration.  The last line of the Sage code, above, is a
list, the first element of which is the resulting stable configuration,
`(2,1,1)`.  The second component records how many times each vertex fired in
the stabilization.

--------

Since the sink is accessible from each nonsink vertex and never fires, every
configuration will stabilize after a finite number of vertex-firings.  It is
not obvious, but the resulting stabilization is independent of the order in
which unstable vertices are fired.  Thus, each configuration stabilizes to a
unique stable configuration.

Laplacian
^^^^^^^^^

Fix an order on the vertices of `\Gamma`. The *Laplacian* of `\Gamma` is

.. math::

    L := D-A

where `D` is the diagonal matrix of out-degrees of the vertices and `A` is the
adjacency matrix whose `(i,j)`-th entry is the weight of the edge from vertex
`i` to vertex `j`, which we take to be `0` if there is no edge.  The *reduced
Laplacian*, `\tilde{L}`, is the submatrix of the Laplacian formed by removing
the row and column corresponding to the sink vertex.  Firing a vertex of a
configuration is the same as subtracting the corresponding row of the reduced
Laplacian.

**Example.** (Continued.) ::

    sage: S.vertices()  # the ordering of the vertices
    [1, 2, 3, 'sink']
    sage: S.laplacian()
    [ 4 -1 -2 -1]
    [-1  2 -1  0]
    [-1 -1  2  0]
    [ 0  0  0  0]
    sage: S.reduced_laplacian()
    [ 4 -1 -2]
    [-1  2 -1]
    [-1 -1  2]

    The configuration we considered previously:

    sage: c = SandpileConfig(S, [5,0,1])
    sage: c
    {1: 5, 2: 0, 3: 1}

    Firing vertex 1 is the same as subtracting the
    corresponding row from the reduced Laplacian:

    sage: c.fire_vertex(1).values()
    [1, 1, 3]
    sage: S.reduced_laplacian()[0]
    (4, -1, -2)
    sage: vector([5,0,1]) - vector([4,-1,-2])
    (1, 1, 3)

Recurrent elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imagine an experiment in which grains of sand are dropped one-at-a-time onto a
graph, pausing to allow the configuration to stabilize between drops.  Some
configurations will only be seen once in this process.  For example, for most
graphs, once sand is dropped on the graph, no addition of sand+stabilization
will result in a graph empty of sand.  Other configurations---the so-called
*recurrent configurations*---will be seen infinitely often as the process is
repeated indefinitely.

To be precise, a configuration `c` is *recurrent* if (i) it is stable, and (ii)
given any configuration `a`, there is a configuration `b` such that
`c=\mbox{stab}(a+b)`, the stabilization of `a+b`.

The *maximal-stable* configuration, denoted `c_{\mathrm{max}}` is defined by
`c_{\mathrm{max}}(v)=\mbox{out-degree}(v)-1` for all nonsink vertices `v`.  It is clear that `c_{\mathrm{max}}` is recurrent.  Further, it is not hard to see that a configuration is recurrent if and only if it has the form `\mbox{stab}(a+c_{\mathrm{max}})` for some configuration `a`.

**Example.** (Continued.) ::

    sage: S.recurrents(verbose=false)
    [[3, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 0]]
    sage: c = SandpileConfig(S, [2,1,1])
    sage: c
    {1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}
    sage: c.is_recurrent()
    True
    sage: S.max_stable()
    {1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 1}

    Adding any configuration to the max-stable configuration and stabilizing
    yields a recurrent configuration.

    sage: x = SandpileConfig(S, [1,0,0])
    sage: x + S.max_stable()
    {1: 4, 2: 1, 3: 1}

    Use & to add and stabilize:

    sage: c = x & S.max_stable()
    sage: c
    {1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 0}
    sage: c.is_recurrent()
    True

    Note the various ways of performing addition + stabilization:

    sage: m = S.max_stable()
    sage: (x + m).stabilize() == ~(x + m)
    True
    sage: (x + m).stabilize() == x & m
    True


Burning Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *burning configuration* is a nonnegative integer-linear combination of the
rows of the reduced Laplacian matrix having nonnegative entries and such that
every vertex has a path from some vertex in its support.  The corresponding
*burning script* gives the integer-linear combination needed to obtain the
burning configuration.  So if `b` is the burning configuration, `\sigma` is its
script, and `\tilde{L}` is the reduced Laplacian, then `\sigma\,\tilde{L} = b`.
The *minimal burning configuration* is the one with the minimal script (its
components are no larger than the components of any other script for a burning
configuration).

The following are equivalent for a configuration `c` with burning
configuration `b` having script `\sigma`:

 - `c` is recurrent;
 - `c+b` stabilizes to `c`;
 - the firing vector for the stabilization of `c+b` is `\sigma`.

The burning configuration and script are computed using a modified
version of Speer's script algorithm.  This is a generalization to
directed multigraphs of Dhar's burning algorithm.

**Example.** ::

    sage: g = {0:{},1:{0:1,3:1,4:1},2:{0:1,3:1,5:1},
    ....:      3:{2:1,5:1},4:{1:1,3:1},5:{2:1,3:1}}
    sage: G = Sandpile(g,0)
    sage: G.burning_config()
    {1: 2, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0}
    sage: G.burning_config().values()
    [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]
    sage: G.burning_script()
    {1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 1, 5: 4}
    sage: G.burning_script().values()
    [1, 3, 5, 1, 4]
    sage: matrix(G.burning_script().values())*G.reduced_laplacian()
    [2 0 1 1 0]

Sandpile group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The collection of stable configurations forms a commutative monoid with
addition defined as ordinary addition followed by stabilization.  The identity
element is the all-zero configuration.  This monoid is a group
exactly when the underlying graph is a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

The recurrent elements form a submonoid which turns out to be a group.  This
group is called the *sandpile group* for `\Gamma`, denoted
`\mathcal{S}(\Gamma)`.  Its identity element is usually not the all-zero
configuration (again, only in the case that `\Gamma` is a DAG).  So finding the
identity element is an interesting problem.

Let `n=|V|-1` and fix an ordering of the nonsink vertices. Let
`\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\subset\mathbb{Z}^n` denote the column-span of
`\tilde{L}^t`, the transpose of the reduced Laplacian.  It is a theorem that

.. math::

    \mathcal{S}(\Gamma)\approx \mathbb{Z}^n/\mathcal{\tilde{L}}.

Thus, the number of elements of the sandpile group is `\det{\tilde{L}}`, which
by the matrix-tree theorem is the number of weighted trees directed into the
sink.

**Example.** (Continued.) ::

    sage: S.group_order()
    3
    sage: S.invariant_factors()
    [1, 1, 3]
    sage: S.reduced_laplacian().dense_matrix().smith_form()
    (
    [1 0 0]  [ 0  0  1]  [3 1 4]
    [0 1 0]  [ 1  0  0]  [4 1 6]
    [0 0 3], [ 0  1 -1], [4 1 5]
    )

    Adding the identity to any recurrent configuration and stabilizing yields
    the same recurrent configuration:

    sage: S.identity()
    {1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 0}
    sage: i = S.identity()
    sage: m = S.max_stable()
    sage: i & m == m
    True

Self-organized criticality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sandpile model was introduced by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld in the paper,
*Self-organized criticality: an explanation of 1/ƒ noise* [BTW]_.  The term
*self-organized criticality* has no precise definition, but can be
loosely taken to describe a system that naturally evolves to a state that is
barely stable and such that the instabilities are described by a power law.
In practice, *self-organized criticality* is often taken to mean *like the
sandpile model on a grid-graph*.  The grid graph is just a grid with an extra
sink vertex.  The vertices on the interior of each side have one edge to the
sink, and the corner vertices have an edge of weight `2`.  Thus, every nonsink
vertex has out-degree `4`.

Imagine repeatedly dropping grains of sand on and empty grid graph, allowing
the sandpile to stabilize in between.  At first there is little activity, but
as time goes on, the size and extent of the avalanche caused by a single grain
of sand becomes hard to predict.  Computer experiments---I do not think there
is a proof, yet---indicate that the distribution of avalanche sizes obeys a
power law with exponent -1.  In the example below, the size of an avalanche is
taken to be the sum of the number of times each vertex fires.

**Example (distribution of avalanche sizes).** ::

    sage: S = sandpiles.Grid(10,10)
    sage: m = S.max_stable()
    sage: a = []
    sage: for i in range(10000):  # long time (15s on sage.math, 2012)
    ....:     m = m.add_random()
    ....:     m, f = m.stabilize(true)
    ....:     a.append(sum(f.values()))
    ...
    sage: p = list_plot([[log(i+1),log(a.count(i))] for i in [0..max(a)] if a.count(i)])  # long time
    sage: p.axes_labels(['log(N)','log(D(N))'])  # long time
    sage: p  # long time
    Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive

   Distribution of avalanche sizes

Note: In the above code, ``m.stabilize(true)`` returns a list consisting of the
stabilized configuration and the firing vector.  (Omitting ``true`` would give
just the stabilized configuration.)

.. _discrete_riemann_surfaces:

Divisors and Discrete Riemann surfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A reference for this section is *Riemann-Roch and Abel-Jacobi theory on a finite
graph* [BN]_.

A *divisor* on `\Gamma` is an element of the free abelian group on its
vertices, including the sink.  Suppose, as above, that the `n+1` vertices of
`\Gamma` have been ordered, and that `\mathcal{L}` is the column span of the
transpose of the Laplacian.  A divisor is then identified with an element
`D\in\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}` and two divisors are *linearly equivalent* if they
differ by an element of `\mathcal{L}`.  A divisor `E` is *effective*, written
`E\geq0`, if `E(v)\geq0` for each `v\in V`, i.e., if `E\in\mathbb{N}^{n+1}`.
The *degree* of a divisor, `D`, is `deg(D) := \sum_{v\in V}D(v)`.   The
divisors of degree zero modulo linear equivalence form the *Picard group*, or
*Jacobian* of the graph. For an undirected graph, the Picard group is
isomorphic to the sandpile group.

The *complete linear system* for a divisor `D`, denoted `|D|`, is the
collection of effective divisors linearly equivalent to `D.`

Riemann-Roch
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To describe the Riemann-Roch theorem in this context, suppose that `\Gamma` is
an undirected, unweighted graph. The *dimension*, `r(D)` of the linear system
`|D|` is `-1` if `|D|=\emptyset` and otherwise is the greatest integer `s` such
that `|D-E|\neq0` for all effective divisors `E` of degree `s`.  Define the
*canonical divisor* by `K=\sum_{v\in V}(\deg(v)-2)v` and the *genus* by `g =
\#(E) - \#(V) + 1`.  The Riemann-Roch theorem says that for any divisor `D`,

.. math::

    r(D)-r(K-D)=\deg(D)+1-g.

**Example.**::

    sage: G = sandpiles.Complete(5)  # the sandpile on the complete graph with 5 vertices

    A divisor on the graph:

    sage: D = SandpileDivisor(G, [1,2,2,0,2])

    Verify the Riemann-Roch theorem:

    sage: K = G.canonical_divisor()
    sage: D.rank() - (K - D).rank() == D.deg() + 1 - G.genus()
    True

    The effective divisors linearly equivalent to D:

    sage: D.effective_div(False)
    [[0, 1, 1, 4, 1], [1, 2, 2, 0, 2], [4, 0, 0, 3, 0]]

    The nonspecial divisors up to linear equivalence (divisors of degree
    g-1 with empty linear systems)

    sage: N = G.nonspecial_divisors()
    sage: [E.values() for E in N[:5]]   # the first few
    [[-1, 0, 1, 2, 3],
     [-1, 0, 1, 3, 2],
     [-1, 0, 2, 1, 3],
     [-1, 0, 2, 3, 1],
     [-1, 0, 3, 1, 2]]
    sage: len(N)
    24
    sage: len(N) == G.h_vector()[-1]
    True

Picturing linear systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fix a divisor `D`.  There are at least two natural graphs associated with
linear system associated with `D`.  First, consider the directed graph with
vertex set `|D|` and with an edge from vertex `E` to vertex `F` if `F` is
attained from `E` by firing a single unstable vertex. ::

    sage: S = Sandpile(graphs.CycleGraph(6),0)
    sage: D = SandpileDivisor(S, [1,1,1,1,2,0])
    sage: D.is_alive()
    True
    sage: eff = D.effective_div()
    sage: firing_graph(S,eff).show3d(edge_size=.005,vertex_size=0.01,iterations=500)

.. figure:: media/sandpile/C_6.png
   :align: center

   Complete linear system for (1,1,1,1,2,0) on `C_6`: single firings

The second graph has the same set of vertices but with an edge from `E` to `F`
if `F` is obtained from `E` by firing all unstable vertices of `E`. ::

    sage: S = Sandpile(graphs.CycleGraph(6),0)
    sage: D = SandpileDivisor(S, [1,1,1,1,2,0])
    sage: eff = D.effective_div() 
    sage: parallel_firing_graph(S,eff).show3d(edge_size=.005,vertex_size=0.01,iterations=500)

.. figure:: media/sandpile/C_6-parallel.png
   :align: center

   Complete linear system for (1,1,1,1,2,0) on `C_6`: parallel firings

Note that in each of the examples, above, starting at any divisor in the linear
system and following edges, one is eventually led into a cycle of length 6
(cycling the divisor (1,1,1,1,2,0)).  Thus, ``D.alive()`` returns ``True``.  In
Sage, one would be able to rotate the above figures to get a better idea of the
structure.

Algebraic geometry of sandpiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Affine
~~~~~~

Let `n=|V|-1`, and fix an ordering on the nonsink vertices of `\Gamma`.  let
`\tilde{\mathcal{L}}\subset\mathbb{Z}^n` denote the column-span of
`\tilde{L}^t`, the transpose of the reduced Laplacian.  Label vertex `i` with the
indeterminate `x_i`, and let `\mathbb{C}[\Gamma_s] = \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_n]`.
(Here, `s` denotes the sink vertex of `\Gamma`.) The *sandpile ideal* or
*toppling ideal*, first studied by Cori, Rossin, and Salvy [CRS]_ for undirected graphs, is the lattice ideal for `\tilde{\mathcal{L}}`:

.. math::

    I = I(\Gamma_s) := \{x^u-x^v: u-v\in
    \tilde{\mathcal{L}}\}\subset\mathbb{C}[\Gamma_s],

where `x^u := \prod_{i=1}^nx^{u_i}` for `u\in\mathbb{Z}^n`.

For each `c\in\mathbb{Z}^n` define `t(c) = x^{c^+} - x^{c^-}` where
`c^+_i=\max\{c_i,0\}` and `c^-=\max\{-c_i,0\}` so that `c=c^+-c^-`.
Then, for each `\sigma\in\mathbb{Z}^n`, define `T(\sigma) =
t(\tilde{L}^t\sigma)`.  It then turns out that

.. math::

    I = (T(e_1),\dots,T(e_n),x^b-1)

where `e_i` is the `i`-th standard basis vector and `b` is any burning
configuration.

The affine coordinate ring, `\mathbb{C}[\Gamma_s]/I,` is isomorphic to the group
algebra of the sandpile group, `\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{S}(\Gamma)].`

The standard term-ordering on `\mathbb{C}[\Gamma_s]` is graded reverse
lexigraphical order with `x_i>x_j` if vertex `v_i` is further from the sink than
vertex `v_j`. (There are choices to be made for vertices equidistant from the
sink). If `\sigma_b` is the script for a burning configuration (not
necessarily minimal), then

.. math::

    \{T(\sigma): \sigma\leq\sigma_b\}

is a Groebner basis for `I`.

Projective
~~~~~~~~~~

Now let `\mathbb{C}[\Gamma]=\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n]`, where `x_0`
corresponds to the sink vertex.  The *homogeneous sandpile ideal*, denoted
`I^h`, is obtaining by homogenizing `I` with respect to `x_0`.  Let `L` be the
(full) Laplacian, and `\mathcal{L}\subset\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}` be the column span of
its transpose, `L^t.`  Then `I^h` is the lattice ideal for `\mathcal{L}`:

.. math::

    I^h = I^h(\Gamma) := \{x^u-x^v: u-v \in\mathcal{L}\}\subset\mathbb{C}[\Gamma].

This ideal can be calculated by saturating the ideal

.. math::

    (T(e_i): i=0,\dots n)

with respect to the product of the indeterminates: `\prod_{i=0}^nx_i` (extending
the `T` operator in the obvious way).  A Groebner basis with respect to the
degree lexicographic order describe above (with `x_0` the smallest vertex), is
obtained by homogenizing each element of the Groebner basis for the
non-homogeneous sandpile ideal with respect to `x_0.`

    and its first differences (which counts the number of superstable
    configurations in each degree):

    sage: S.h_vector()
    [1, 4, 6, 4]
    sage: x = [i.deg() for i in S.superstables()]
    sage: sorted(x)
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]

    The degree in which the Hilbert function equals the Hilbert polynomial, the
    latter always being a constant in the case of a sandpile ideal:

    sage: S.postulation()
    3

Zeros
~~~~~

The *zero set* for the sandpile ideal `I` is

.. math::

    Z(I) = \{p\in\mathbb{C}^n: f(p)=0\mbox{ for all $f\in I$}\},

the set of simultaneous zeros of the polynomials in `I.`  Letting `S^1` denote
the unit circle in the complex plane, `Z(I)` is a finite
subgroup of `S^1\times\dots\times S^1\subset\mathbb{C}^n`, isomorphic to the
sandpile group.  The zero set is actually linearly isomorphic to a faithful representation of the sandpile group on `\mathbb{C}^n.`

**Example.** (Continued.) ::

    sage: S = Sandpile({0: {}, 1: {2: 2}, 2: {0: 4, 1: 1}}, 0)
    sage: S.ideal().gens()
    [x1^2 - x2^2, x1*x2^3 - x0^4, x2^5 - x1*x0^4]

    Approximation to the zero set (setting ``x_0 = 1``):

    sage: S.solve()
    [[-0.707107 + 0.707107*I, 0.707107 - 0.707107*I],
    [-0.707107 - 0.707107*I, 0.707107 + 0.707107*I],
    [-I, -I],
    [I, I],
    [0.707107 + 0.707107*I, -0.707107 - 0.707107*I],
    [0.707107 - 0.707107*I, -0.707107 + 0.707107*I],
    [1, 1],
    [-1, -1]]
    sage: len(_) == S.group_order()
    True

    The zeros are generated as a group by a single vector:

    sage: S.points()
    [[(1/2*I + 1/2)*sqrt(2), -(1/2*I + 1/2)*sqrt(2)]]


Resolutions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The homogeneous sandpile ideal, `I^h`, has a free resolution graded by the
divisors on `\Gamma` modulo linear equivalence.  (See the section on
:ref:`Discrete Riemann Surfaces <discrete_riemann_surfaces>` for the language of
divisors and linear equivalence.)  Let
`S=\mathbb{C}[\Gamma]=\mathbb{C}[x_0,\dots,x_n]`, as above, and let
`\mathfrak{S}` denote the group of divisors modulo rational equivalence.  Then
`S` is graded by `\mathfrak{S}` by letting `\deg(x^c)= c\in\mathfrak{S}` for
each monomial `x^c`.  The minimal free resolution of `I^h` has the form

.. math::

     0\leftarrow I^h
    \leftarrow\oplus_{D\in\mathfrak{S}}S(-D)^{\beta_{0,D}}\leftarrow\oplus_{D\in\mathfrak{S}}S(-D)^{\beta_{1,D}}
    \leftarrow\dots\leftarrow\oplus_{D\in\mathfrak{S}}S(-D)^{\beta_{r,D}}\leftarrow0.

where the `\beta_{i,D}` are the *Betti numbers* for `I^h`.

For each divisor class `D\in\mathfrak{S}`, define a simplicial complex,

.. math::

    \Delta_D := \{I\subseteq\{0,\dots,n\}: I\subseteq\mbox{supp}(E)\mbox{ for some}\
    E\in |D|\}.

The Betti number `\beta_{i,D}` equals the dimension over `\mathbb{C}` of the
`i`-th reduced homology group of `\Delta_D`:

.. math::

    \beta_{i,D} = \dim_{\mathbb{C}}\tilde{H}_i(\Delta_D;\mathbb{C}).

::

    sage: S = Sandpile({0:{},1:{0: 1, 2: 1, 3: 4},2:{3: 5},3:{1: 1, 2: 1}},0)

    Representatives of all divisor classes with nontrivial homology:

    sage: p = S.betti_complexes()
    sage: p[0]
    [{0: -8, 1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 1},
     Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 3) and facets {(1, 2), (3,)}]

    The homology associated with the first divisor in the list:

    sage: D = p[0][0]
    sage: D.effective_div()
    [{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 2}, {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0}]
    sage: [E.support() for E in D.effective_div()]
    [[3], [1, 2]]
    sage: D.Dcomplex()
    Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 3) and facets {(1, 2), (3,)}
    sage: D.Dcomplex().homology()
    {0: Z, 1: 0}


    The minimal free resolution:

    sage: S.resolution()
    'R^1 <-- R^5 <-- R^5 <-- R^1'
    sage: S.betti()
               0     1     2     3
    ------------------------------
        0:     1     -     -     -
        1:     -     5     5     -

    ------------------------------
    total:     1     5     5     1
    sage: len(p)
    11

    The degrees and ranks of the homology groups for each element of the list p
    (compare with the Betti table, above):

Usage
-----

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three main classes for sandpile structures in Sage: ``Sandpile``,
``SandpileConfig``, and ``SandpileDivisor``.  Initialization for ``Sandpile``
has the form

.. code-block:: python

    sage: S = Sandpile(graph, sink)

where ``graph`` represents a graph and ``sink`` is the key for the sink
vertex.  There are four possible forms for ``graph``:

1. a Python dictionary of dictionaries::

    sage: g = {0: {}, 1: {0: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}, 2: {0: 1, 3: 1, 5: 1},
    ....:      3: {2: 1, 5: 1}, 4: {1: 1, 3: 1}, 5: {2: 1, 3: 1}}


.. figure:: media/sandpile/initial.png
   :align: center

   Graph from dictionary of dictionaries.

Each key is the name of a vertex.  Next to each vertex name `v` is a dictionary
consisting of pairs: ``vertex: weight``.  Each pair represents a directed edge
emanating from `v` and ending at ``vertex`` having (non-negative integer) weight
equal to ``weight``.  Loops are allowed. In the example above, all of the weights are 1.

2. a Python dictionary of lists::

    sage: g = {0: [], 1: [0, 3, 4], 2: [0, 3, 5],
    ....:      3: [2, 5], 4: [1, 3], 5: [2, 3]}

This is a short-hand when all of the edge-weights are equal to 1.  The above
example is for the same displayed graph.

3. a Sage graph (of type ``sage.graphs.graph.Graph``)::

    sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
    sage: S = Sandpile(g, 0)
    sage: type(g)
    <class 'sage.graphs.graph.Graph'>

To see the types of built-in graphs, type ``graphs.``, including the period,
and hit TAB.

4. a Sage digraph::

    sage: S = Sandpile(digraphs.RandomDirectedGNC(6), 0)
    sage: S.show()

.. figure:: media/sandpile/random.png
   :align: center

   A random graph.

See
`sage.graphs.graph_generators <../reference/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html>`_ for
more information on the Sage graph library and graph constructors.

Each of these four formats is preprocessed by the Sandpile class so that,
internally, the graph is represented by the dictionary of dictionaries format
first presented.  This internal format is returned by  ``dict()``::

    sage: S = Sandpile({0:[], 1:[0, 3, 4], 2:[0, 3, 5], 3: [2, 5], 4: [1, 3], 5: [2, 3]},0)
    sage: S.dict()
    {0: {},
     1: {0: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1},
     2: {0: 1, 3: 1, 5: 1},
     3: {2: 1, 5: 1},
     4: {1: 1, 3: 1},
     5: {2: 1, 3: 1}}


.. note::

   The user is responsible for assuring that each vertex has a directed path
   into the designated sink.  If the sink has out-edges, these will be ignored
   for the purposes of sandpile calculations (but not calculations on divisors).

Code for checking whether a given vertex is a sink: ::

    sage: S = Sandpile({0:[], 1:[0, 3, 4], 2:[0, 3, 5], 3: [2, 5], 4: [1, 3], 5: [2, 3]},0)
    sage: [S.distance(v,0) for v in S.vertices()] # 0 is a sink
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
    sage: [S.distance(v,1) for v in S.vertices()] # 1 is not a sink
    [+Infinity, 0, +Infinity, +Infinity, 1, +Infinity]

**Complete descriptions of Sandpile methods.**

.. _all_k_config:

**all_k_config(k)**

The constant configuration with all values set to `k`.

INPUT:

``k`` -- integer

OUTPUT:

SandpileConfig

EXAMPLES::

    sage: s = sandpiles.Diamond()
    sage: s.all_k_config(7)
    {1: 7, 2: 7, 3: 7}

---

.. _all_k_div:

**all_k_div(k)**

The divisor with all values set to `k`.

INPUT:

``k`` -- integer

OUTPUT:

SandpileDivisor

EXAMPLES::

    sage: S = sandpiles.House()
    sage: S.all_k_div(7)
    {0: 7, 1: 7, 2: 7, 3: 7, 4: 7}

---

.. _avalanche_polynomial:

**avalanche_polynomial(multivariable=True)**

The avalanche polynomial.  See NOTE for details.

INPUT:

``multivariable`` -- (default: ``True``) boolean

OUTPUT:

polynomial

EXAMPLES::

    sage: s = sandpiles.Complete(4)
    sage: s.avalanche_polynomial()
    9*x0*x1*x2 + 2*x0*x1 + 2*x0*x2 + 2*x1*x2 + 3*x0 + 3*x1 + 3*x2 + 24
    sage: s.avalanche_polynomial(False)
    9*x0^3 + 6*x0^2 + 9*x0 + 24

.. NOTE::

    For each nonsink vertex `v`, let `x_v` be an indeterminate.
    If `(r,v)` is a pair consisting of a recurrent `r` and nonsink
    vertex `v`, then for each nonsink vertex `w`, let `n_w` be the
    number of times vertex `w` fires in the stabilization of `r + v`.
    Let `M(r,v)` be the monomial `\prod_w x_w^{n_w}`, i.e., the exponent
    records the vector of `n_w` as `w` ranges over the nonsink vertices.
    The avalanche polynomial is then the sum of `M(r,v)` as `r` ranges
    over the recurrents and `v` ranges over the nonsink vertices.  If
    ``multivariable`` is ``False``, then set all the indeterminates equal
    to each other (and, thus, only count the number of vertex firings in the
    stabilizations, forgetting which particular vertices fired).

---

.. _betti:

**betti(verbose=True)**

The Betti table for the homogeneous toppling ideal.  If
``verbose`` is ``True``, it prints the standard Betti table, otherwise,
it returns a less formated table.

    ------------------------------

    sage: p = S.betti_complexes()
    sage: p[0]
    [{0: -8, 1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 1}, Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 3) and facets {(1, 2), (3,)}]

    sage: S.betti()
               0     1     2     3
    ------------------------------
        0:     1     -     -     -
        1:     -     5     5     -
        2:     -     -     -     1
    ------------------------------
    total:     1     5     5     1
    sage: len(p)
    11
    sage: p[0][1].homology()
    {0: Z, 1: 0}
    sage: p[-1][1].homology()
    {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: Z}

.. NOTE::

    A ``support-complex`` is the simplicial complex formed from the
    supports of the divisors in a linear system.

---

.. _burning_config:

**burning_config()**

The minimal burning configuration.

OUTPUT:

dict (configuration)

EXAMPLES::

    sage: g = {0:{},1:{0:1,3:1,4:1},2:{0:1,3:1,5:1}, \
               3:{2:1,5:1},4:{1:1,3:1},5:{2:1,3:1}}
    sage: S = Sandpile(g,0)
    sage: S.burning_config()
    {1: 2, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0}
    sage: S.burning_config().values()
    [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]
    sage: S.burning_script()
    {1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 1, 5: 4}
    sage: script = S.burning_script().values()
    sage: script
    [1, 3, 5, 1, 4]
    sage: matrix(script)*S.reduced_laplacian()
    [2 0 1 1 0]

.. NOTE::

    The burning configuration and script are computed using a modified
    version of Speer's script algorithm.  This is a generalization to
    directed multigraphs of Dhar's burning algorithm.

    A *burning configuration* is a nonnegative integer-linear
    combination of the rows of the reduced Laplacian matrix having
    nonnegative entries and such that every vertex has a path from some
    vertex in its support.  The corresponding *burning script* gives
    the integer-linear combination needed to obtain the burning
    configuration.  So if `b` is the burning configuration, `\sigma` is its
    script, and `\tilde{L}` is the reduced Laplacian, then `\sigma\cdot
    \tilde{L} = b`.  The *minimal burning configuration* is the one
    with the minimal script (its components are no larger than the
    components of any other script
    for a burning configuration).

    The following are equivalent for a configuration `c` with burning
    configuration `b` having script `\sigma`:

     - `c` is recurrent;
     - `c+b` stabilizes to `c`;
     - the firing vector for the stabilization of `c+b` is `\sigma`.

---

.. _burning_script:

**burning_script()**

A script for the minimal burning configuration.

OUTPUT:

dict

EXAMPLES::

    sage: g = {0:{},1:{0:1,3:1,4:1},2:{0:1,3:1,5:1},\
    3:{2:1,5:1},4:{1:1,3:1},5:{2:1,3:1}}
    sage: S = Sandpile(g,0)
    sage: S.burning_config()
    {1: 2, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0}
    sage: S.burning_config().values()
    [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]
    sage: S.burning_script()
    {1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 5, 4: 1, 5: 4}
    sage: script = S.burning_script().values()
    sage: script
    [1, 3, 5, 1, 4]
    sage: matrix(script)*S.reduced_laplacian()
    [2 0 1 1 0]

.. NOTE::

    The burning configuration and script are computed using a modified
    version of Speer's script algorithm.  This is a generalization to
    directed multigraphs of Dhar's burning algorithm.

    A *burning configuration* is a nonnegative integer-linear
    combination of the rows of the reduced Laplacian matrix having
    nonnegative entries and such that every vertex has a path from some
    vertex in its support.  The corresponding *burning script* gives the
    integer-linear combination needed to obtain the burning configuration.
    So if `b` is the burning configuration, `s` is its script, and
    `L_{\mathrm{red}}` is the reduced Laplacian, then `s\cdot
    L_{\mathrm{red}}= b`.  The *minimal burning configuration* is the one
    with the minimal script (its components are no larger than the
    components of any other script
    for a burning configuration).

    The following are equivalent for a configuration `c` with burning
    configuration `b` having script `s`:

     - `c` is recurrent;
     - `c+b` stabilizes to `c`;
     - the firing vector for the stabilization of `c+b` is `s`.

---

.. _canonical_divisor:

**canonical_divisor()**

The canonical divisor.  This is the divisor with `\deg(v)-2` grains of
sand on each vertex (not counting loops).  Only for undirected graphs.

OUTPUT:

SandpileDivisor

EXAMPLES::

    sage: S = sandpiles.Complete(4)
    sage: S.canonical_divisor()
    {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}
    sage: s = Sandpile({0:[1,1],1:[0,0,1,1,1]},0)
    sage: s.canonical_divisor()  # loops are disregarded
    {0: 0, 1: 0}

.. WARNING::

    The underlying graph must be undirected.

**dict()**

A dictionary of dictionaries representing a directed graph.

.. _jacobian_representatives:

**jacobian_representatives(verbose=True)**

Representatives for the elements of the Jacobian group. If ``verbose``
is ``False``, then lists representing the divisors are returned.

INPUT:

``verbose`` -- (default: ``True``) boolean

OUTPUT:

list of SandpileDivisor (or of lists representing divisors)

EXAMPLES:

For an undirected graph, divisors of the form ``s - deg(s)*sink`` as
``s`` varies over the superstables forms a distinct set of
representatives for the Jacobian group.::

    sage: s = sandpiles.Complete(3)
    sage: s.superstables(False)
    [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]]
    sage: s.jacobian_representatives(False)
    [[0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1], [-1, 1, 0]]

If the graph is directed, the representatives described above may by
equivalent modulo the rowspan of the Laplacian matrix::

    sage: s = Sandpile({0: {1: 1, 2: 2}, 1: {0: 2, 2: 4}, 2: {0: 4, 1: 2}},0)
    sage: s.group_order()
    28
    sage: s.jacobian_representatives()
    [{0: -5, 1: 3, 2: 2}, {0: -4, 1: 3, 2: 1}]

Let `\tau` be the nonnegative generator of the kernel of the transpose of
the Laplacian, and let `tau_s` be it sink component, then the sandpile
group is isomorphic to the direct sum of the cyclic group of order
`\tau_s` and the Jacobian group.  In the example above, we have::

    sage: s.laplacian().left_kernel()
    Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
    Echelon basis matrix:
    [14  5  8]

    integer rowspan of the Laplacian matrix.

---

.. _laplacian:

    [ 2 -1 -1  0]
    [-1  3 -1 -1]
    [-1 -1  3 -1]
    [ 0 -1 -1  2]

    indegree version of the Laplacian.

---

.. _markov_chain:

    sage: m = s.markov_chain([0,0,0])

    sage: m = s.markov_chain(s.zero_div(), [0.1,0.1,0.1,0.7])
    sage: m.next().values() # random
    [0, 0, 0, 1]
    sage: m.next().values() # random

    sage: m.next().values() # random
    [1, 1, 2, 1]
    sage: m.next().values() # random
    [1, 1, 2, 2]
    sage: m.next().values() # random
    [1, 1, 2, 3]
    sage: m.next().values() # random
    [1, 1, 2, 4]
    sage: m.next().values() # random
    [1, 1, 3, 4]

.. NOTE::

    The ``closed sandpile Markov chain`` has state space consisting of the configurations
    on a sandpile.  It transitions from a state by choosing a vertex at random
    (according to the probability distribution ``distrib``), dropping a grain of sand at
    that vertex, and stabilizing.  If the chosen vertex is the sink, the chain stays
    at the current state.

    The ``open sandpile Markov chain`` has state space consisting of the recurrent elements,
    i.e., the state space is the sandpile group.  It transitions from the configuration `c`
    by choosing a vertex `v` at random according to ``distrib``.  The next state is the
    stabilization of `c+v`.  If `v` is the sink vertex, then the stabilization of `c+v`
    is defined to be `c`.

    Note that in either case, if ``distrib`` is specified, its length is equal to
    the total number of vertices (including the sink).

We compute the "sizes" of the avalanches caused by adding random grains
of sand to the maximal stable configuration on a grid graph.  The
function ``stabilize()`` returns the firing vector of the
stabilization, a dictionary whose values say how many times each vertex
fires in the stabilization.::

    sage: S = sandpiles.Grid(10,10)
    sage: m = S.max_stable()
    sage: a = []
    sage: for i in range(1000):
    ...       m = m.add_random()
    ...       m, f = m.stabilize(True)
    ...       a.append(sum(f.values()))
    ...
    sage: p = list_plot([[log(i+1),log(a.count(i))] for i in [0..max(a)] if a.count(i)])
    sage: p.axes_labels(['log(N)','log(D(N))'])
    sage: t = text("Distribution of avalanche sizes", (2,2), rgbcolor=(1,0,0))
    sage: show(p+t,axes_labels=['log(N)','log(D(N))'])

.. NOTE::

    If ``distrib`` is ``None``, then the probability is the uniform probability on the nonsink
    vertices.  Otherwise, there are two possibilities:

    (i) the length of ``distrib`` is equal to the number of vertices, and ``distrib`` represents
    a probability distribution on all of the vertices.  In that case, the sink may be chosen
    at random, in which case, the  configuration is unchanged.

    (ii) Otherwise, the length of ``distrib`` must be equal to the number of nonsink vertices,
    and ``distrib`` represents a probability distribution on the nonsink vertices.

.. WARNING::

    If ``distrib != None``, the user is responsible for assuring the sum of its entries is
    1 and that its length is equal to the number of sink vertices or the number of nonsink vertices.

.. _burst_size-config:

**burst_size(v)**

The burst size of the configuration with respect to the given vertex.

INPUT:

``v`` -- vertex

OUTPUT:

integer

EXAMPLES::

    sage: s = sandpiles.Diamond()
    sage: [i.burst_size(0) for i in s.recurrents()]
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    sage: [i.burst_size(1) for i in s.recurrents()]
    [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2]

.. NOTE::

    To define ``c.burst(v)``, if `v` is not the sink, let `c'` be the unique
    recurrent for which the the stabilization of `c' + v` is `c`.  The
    burst size is then the amount of sand that goes into the sink during this
    stabilization.  If `v` is the sink, the burst size is defined to be 1.

     An inequality (1, 1, 1) x + 4 >= 0,
     An inequality (1, -3, 1) x + 0 >= 0,
     An inequality (1, 1, -3) x + 0 >= 0)
    sage: D = SandpileDivisor(s,[-1,0,0,0])

    True

 Riemann-Roch theorem::

    sage: D.rank() - (S.canonical_divisor()-D).rank() == D.deg() + 1 - S.genus()

    The rank of a divisor `D` is -1 if `D` is not linearly equivalent to an effective divisor
    (i.e., the dollar game represented by `D` is unwinnable).  Otherwise, the rank of `D` is
    the largest integer `r` such that `D - E` is linearly equivalent to an effective divisor

    sage: [D.weierstrass_gap_seq(v,False) for v in s.vertices()]
    [(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 2)]
    sage: [D.weierstrass_gap_seq(v) for v in s.vertices()]

    sage: D.weierstrass_gap_seq()  # gap sequence at sink vertex, 0
    ((1, 3), 1)
    sage: D.weierstrass_rank_seq()  # rank sequence at the sink vertex
    (1, 0, 0, -1)

.. NOTE::

    The integer `k` is a Weierstrass gap for the divisor `D` at vertex `v` if the rank
    of `D - (k-1)v` does not equal the rank of `D - kv`.  Let `r` be the rank of `D` and
    let `k_i` be the `i`-th gap at `v`.  The Weierstrass weight of `v` for `D` is the
    sum of `(k_i - i)` as `i` ranges from `1` to `r + 1`.  It measure the difference
    between the sequence `r, r - 1, ..., 0, -1, -1, ...` and the rank sequence
    `\mathrm{rank}(D), \mathrm{rank}(D - v), \mathrm{rank}(D - 2v), \dots`

    sage: K.weierstrass_pts(True)
    [(4, (1, 0, 0, -1))]

.. NOTE::

    The vertex `v` is a (generalized) Weierstrass point for divisor `D` if the sequence of ranks `r(D - nv)`
    for `n = 0, 1, 2, \dots`` is not `r(D), r(D)-1, \dots, 0, -1, -1, \dots`

---

.. _weierstrass_rank_seq-divisor:

**weierstrass_rank_seq(v='sink')**

The Weierstrass rank sequence at the given vertex.  Computes the rank of
the divisor `D - nv` starting with `n=0` and ending when the rank is
`-1`.

**Complete descriptions of methods.**

.. _firing_graph:

**firing_graph(S, eff)**

    Creates a digraph with divisors as vertices and edges between two divisors
    `D` and `E` if firing a single vertex in `D` gives `E`.

    INPUT:

    ``S`` -- Sandpile
    ``eff`` -- list of divisors

    OUTPUT:

    DiGraph

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: S = sandpiles.Cycle(6)
        sage: D = SandpileDivisor(S, [1,1,1,1,2,0])
        sage: eff = D.effective_div()
        sage: firing_graph(S,eff).show3d(edge_size=.005,vertex_size=0.01)

---

.. _parallel_firing_graph:

**parallel_firing_graph(S,eff)**

    Creates a digraph with divisors as vertices and edges between two
    divisors ``D`` and ``E`` if firing all unstable vertices in ``D`` gives
    ``E``.

    INPUT:

    ``S`` - Sandpile
    ``eff`` - list of divisors

    OUTPUT:

    DiGraph

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: S = Sandpile(graphs.CycleGraph(6),0)
        sage: D = SandpileDivisor(S, [1,1,1,1,2,0])
        sage: eff = D.effective_div()
        sage: parallel_firing_graph(S,eff).show3d(edge_size=.005,vertex_size=0.01)

---

.. _random_DAG:

**random_DAG(num_verts,p=1/2,weight_max=1)**

    Returns a random directed acyclic graph with ``num_verts`` vertices.
    The method starts with the sink vertex and adds vertices one at a time.
    Each vertex is connected only to only previously defined vertices, and the
    probability of each possible connection is given by the argument ``p``.
    The weight of an edge is a random integer between ``1`` and
    ``weight_max``.

    INPUT:

     - ``num_verts`` - positive integer
     - ``p`` - number between `0` and `1`
     - ``weight_max`` -- integer greater than `0`

    OUTPUT:

    directed acyclic graph with sink `0`

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: S = random_DAG(5, 0.3)

.. _wilmes_algorithm:

**wilmes_algorithm(M)**

    Computes an integer matrix ``L`` with the same integer row span as ``M``
    and such that ``L`` is the reduced laplacian of a directed multigraph.

    INPUT:

    ``M`` - square integer matrix of full rank

    OUTPUT:

    ``L`` - integer matrix

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: P = matrix([[2,3,-7,-3],[5,2,-5,5],[8,2,5,4],[-5,-9,6,6]])
