def IntervalGraph(intervals, points_ordered=False):
    r"""
    Return the graph corresponding to the given intervals.

    An interval graph is built from a list `(a_i,b_i)_{1\leq i \leq n}` of
    intervals : to each interval of the list is associated one vertex, two
    vertices being adjacent if the two corresponding (closed) intervals
    intersect.

    INPUT:

    - ``intervals`` -- the list of pairs `(a_i,b_i)` defining the graph.

    - ``points_ordered`` -- states whether every interval `(a_i,b_i)` of
      `intervals` satisfies `a_i<b_i`. If satisfied then setting
      ``points_ordered`` to ``True`` will speed up the creation of the graph.

    .. NOTE::

        * The vertices are named 0, 1, 2, and so on. The intervals used
          to create the graph are saved with the graph and can be recovered
          using ``get_vertex()`` or ``get_vertices()``.

    EXAMPLES:

    The following line creates the sequence of intervals
    `(i, i+2)` for i in `[0, ..., 8]`::

        sage: intervals = [(i,i+2) for i in range(9)]

    In the corresponding graph ::

        sage: g = graphs.IntervalGraph(intervals)

        (1, 3)
        (2, 4)
        (4, 6)
        (5, 7)

    The is_interval() method verifies that this graph is an interval graph. ::

def PermutationGraph(second_permutation, first_permutation=None):
    r"""
    Build a permutation graph from one permutation or from two lists.

    Definition:

    If `\sigma` is a permutation of `\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}`, then the
    permutation graph of `\sigma` is the graph on vertex set
    `\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}` in which two vertices `i` and `j` satisfying
    `i < j` are connected by an edge if and only if
    `\sigma^{-1}(i) > \sigma^{-1}(j)`. A visual way to construct this
    graph is as follows:

      Take two horizontal lines in the euclidean plane, and mark points
      `1, ..., n` from left to right on the first of them. On the second
      one, still from left to right, mark `n` points
      `\sigma(1), \sigma(2), \ldots, \sigma(n)`.
      Now, link by a segment the two points marked with `1`, then link
      together the points marked with `2`, and so on. The permutation
      graph of `\sigma` is the intersection graph of those segments: there
      exists a vertex in this graph for each element from `1` to `n`, two
      vertices `i, j` being adjacent if the segments `i` and `j` cross
      each other.

    The set of edges of the permutation graph can thus be identified with
    the set of inversions of the inverse of the given permutation
    `\sigma`.

    A more general notion of permutation graph can be defined as
    follows: If `S` is a set, and `(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)` and
    `(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)` are two lists of elements of `S`, each of
    which lists contains every element of `S` exactly once, then the
    permutation graph defined by these two lists is the graph on the
    vertex set `S` in which two vertices `i` and `j` are connected by an
    edge if and only if the order in which these vertices appear in the
    list `(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)` is the opposite of the order in which
    they appear in the list `(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)`. When
    `(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = (1, 2, \ldots, n)`, this graph is the
    permutation graph of the permutation
    `(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n) \in S_n`. Notice that `S` does not have to
    be a set of integers here, but can be a set of strings, tuples, or
    anything else. We can still use the above visual description to
    construct the permutation graph, but now we have to mark points
    `a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n` from left to right on the first horizontal
    line and points `b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n` from left to right on the
    second horizontal line.

    INPUT:

    - ``second_permutation`` -- the unique permutation/list defining the graph,
      or the second of the two (if the graph is to be built from two
      permutations/lists).

    - ``first_permutation`` (optional) -- the first of the two
      permutations/lists from which the graph should be built, if it is to be
      built from two permutations/lists.

      When ``first_permutation is None`` (default), it is set to be equal to
      ``sorted(second_permutation)``, which yields the expected ordering when
      the elements of the graph are integers.

def ToleranceGraph(tolrep):

def OrthogonalArrayBlockGraph(k, n, OA=None):
    r"""
    Return the graph of an `OA(k,n)`.

    The intersection graph of the blocks of a transversal design with parameters
    `(k,n)`, or `TD(k,n)` for short, is a strongly regular graph (unless it is a
    complete graph). Its parameters `(v,k',\lambda,\mu)` are determined by the
    parameters `k,n` via:

    .. MATH::

        v=n^2, k'=k(n-1), \lambda=(k-1)(k-2)+n-2, \mu=k(k-1)

    As transversal designs and orthogonal arrays (OA for short) are equivalent
    objects, this graph can also be built from the blocks of an `OA(k,n)`, two
    of them being adjacent if one of their coordinates match.

    For more information on these graphs, see `Andries Brouwer's page
    on Orthogonal Array graphs <https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/OA.html>`_.

    .. WARNING::

        - Brouwer's website uses the notation `OA(n,k)` instead of `OA(k,n)`

        - For given parameters `k` and `n` there can be many `OA(k,n)` : the
          graphs returned are not uniquely defined by their parameters (see the
          examples below).

        - If the function is called only with the parameter ``k`` and ``n`` the
          results might be different with two versions of Sage, or even worse :
          some could not be available anymore.

    .. SEEALSO::

    INPUT:

      :func:`~sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays.orthogonal_array` is
      called to compute an `OA(k,n)`.

    EXAMPLES::

    As ``OAb`` was obtained from ``OAa`` by a relabelling the two graphs are
    isomorphic::

        sage: Ga.is_isomorphic(Gb)
        True

    But there are examples of `OA(k,n)` for which the resulting graphs are not

    The intersection graph of a family `S` is a graph `G` with `V(G)=S` such
    that two elements `s_1,s_2\in S` are adjacent in `G` if and only if `s_1\cap
    s_2\neq \emptyset`.

    INPUT:

    - ``S`` -- a list of sets/tuples/iterables

        .. NOTE::

            The elements of `S` must be finite, hashable, and the elements of
            any `s\in S` must be hashable too.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: graphs.IntersectionGraph([(1,2,3),(3,4,5),(5,6,7)])
        Intersection Graph: Graph on 3 vertices

    TESTS::

        sage: graphs.IntersectionGraph([(1,2,[1])])

        ...
