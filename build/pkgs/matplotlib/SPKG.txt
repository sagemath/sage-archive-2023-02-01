Making a new release of matplotlib is going to be fricken' hard, since
it's getting very patched for SAGE.  We need to make an hg repo for
the .py files, and use a merge system.

----------

The following modifications are all in the sage subdirectory.
They are copied in during the build process.

* I replaced setupext.py by a version that adds
  some SAGE-specific paths so the build doesn't
  fail (since SAGE includes certain libs that
  matplotlib depends on).

* I setup the setup.py file so *no* GUI front-ends
  are built.    This is because on test systems the
  install breaks sometimes when trying to build a GUI, e.g.,
  matplotlib thinks it can build that gui component but
  it really can't.

* Replace all instances of Point with MPL_Point in

     src/_transforms.h and src/_transforms.cpp

  This is because mwrank also defines a class called Point, and
  in Python 2.5, the matploblib Point destructor gets called
  for mwrank points, which causes nasty crashes.

* Replace lib/matplotlib/transform.py with a custom
  version that imports MPL_Point as Point.

* Replace lib/matplotlib/ticker.py with a version that
  comments out line 271:
        #self._powerlimits = rcParams['axes.formatter.limits']
  Also, changed some weird code around line 368:
        self.orderOfMagnitude = oom
##         if oom <= self._powerlimits[0]:
##             self.orderOfMagnitude = oom
##         elif oom >= self._powerlimits[1]:
##             self.orderOfMagnitude = oom
##         else:
##             self.orderOfMagnitude = 0
