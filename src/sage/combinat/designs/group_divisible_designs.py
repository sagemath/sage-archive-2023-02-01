def group_divisible_design(v,K,G,existence=False,check=False):
    r"""
    Return a `(v,K,G)`-Group Divisible Design.

    A `(v,K,G)`-GDD is a pair `(\mathcal G, \mathcal B)` where:

    - `\mathcal G` is a partition of `X=\bigcup \mathcal G` where `|X|=v`

    - `\forall S\in \mathcal G, |S| \in G`

    - `\forall S\in \mathcal B, |S| \in K`

    - `\mathcal G\cup \mathcal B` is a `(v,K\cup G)`-PBD

    For more information, see the documentation of
    :class:`~sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures.GroupDivisibleDesign` or
    :class:`~sage.combinat.designs.bibd.PairwiseBalancedDesign`.

    INPUT:

    - ``v`` (integer)

    - ``K,G`` (sets of integers)

    - ``existence`` (boolean) -- instead of building the design, return:

        - ``True`` -- meaning that Sage knows how to build the design

        - ``Unknown`` -- meaning that Sage does not know how to build the
          design, but that the design may exist (see :mod:`sage.misc.unknown`).

        - ``False`` -- meaning that the design does not exist.

    - ``check`` -- (boolean) Whether to check that output is correct before
      returning it. As this is expected to be useless (but we are cautious
      guys), you may want to disable it whenever you want speed. Set to ``True``
      by default.

    .. NOTE::

        The GDD returned by this function are defined on ``range(v)``, and its
        groups are sets of consecutive integers.

    Group Divisible Design (GDD)

    Let `K` and `G` be sets of positive integers and let `\lambda` be a positive
    integer. A Group Divisible Design of index `\lambda` and order `v` is a
    triple `(V,\mathcal G,\mathcal B)` where:

    - `V` is a set of cardinality `v`

    - `\mathcal G` is a partition of `V` into groups whose size belongs to `G`

    - `\mathcal B` is a family of subsets of `V` whose size belongs to `K` such
      that any two points `p_1,p_2\in V` from different groups appear
      simultaneously in exactly `\lambda` elements of `\mathcal B`. Besides, a
      group and a block intersect on at most one point.

    If `K=\{k_1,...,k_l\}` and `G` has exactly `m_i` groups of cardinality `k_i`
    then `G` is said to have type `k_1^{m_1}...k_l^{m_l}`.

    INPUT:

    - ``points`` -- the underlying set. If ``points`` is an integer `v`, then
      the set is considered to be `\{0, ..., v-1\}`.

    - ``groups`` -- the groups of the design. Set to ``None`` for an automatic
      guess (this triggers ``check=True`` and can thus cost some time).

    - ``blocks`` -- collection of blocks

    - ``G`` -- list of integers of which the sizes of the groups must be
      elements. Set to ``None`` (automatic guess) by default.

    - ``K`` -- list of integers of which the sizes of the blocks must be
      elements. Set to ``None`` (automatic guess) by default.

    - ``lambd`` (integer) -- value of `\lambda`, set to `1` by default.

    - ``check`` (boolean) -- whether to check that the design is indeed a `GDD`
      with the right parameters. Set to ``True`` by default.

    - ``copy`` -- (use with caution) if set to ``False`` then ``blocks`` must be
      a list of lists of integers. The list will not be copied but will be
      modified in place (each block is sorted, and the whole list is
      sorted). Your ``blocks`` object will become the instance's internal data.
