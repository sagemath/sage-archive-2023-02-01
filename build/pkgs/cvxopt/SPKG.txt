== Description ==

CVXOPT is a free software package for convex optimization based on the
Python programming language. It can be used with the interactive
Python interpreter, on the command line by executing Python scripts,
or integrated in other software via Python extension modules. Its main
purpose is to make the development of software for convex optimization
applications straightforward by building on Python's extensive
standard library and on the strengths of Python as a high-level
programming language.

GSL, GLPK

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * TODO: incorporate docs buiding into spkg-install, and/or merge into
   Sage documentation

 * TODO: Add more tests in spkg-check

 * TODO: one might want to enchance the code to allow other Sage
   random sources, at the moment only GSL is used in CVXOPT-1.1.3
   spkg, apparently it will need an unclear to me "with seed(..)"
   construct.

== Changelog ==

=== cvxopt-1.1.3 (Dima Pasechnik, Mike Hansen, Harald Schilly, David Kirkby, Peter Jeremy, November, 2010) ===
 * #6456 Updated to 1.1.3.
 * Modified setup.py to build correctly under Cygwin.
 * applied P.Jeremy's FreeBSD patch (see #6456)
 * corrected the 64-bit specific int* bug reported by pjeremy
 * turned on GSL extension (this is the default mode for CVXOPT, and GSL is a standard Sage spkg, so
   this makes perfect sense); this in particular allowed to get rid of strange random seed-related
   import bugs uncovered by David Kirkby's spkg-check
 * modified spkg-check to report test names, cd to appropriate subdirs, and skip .bin files.
 * corrected the .patch files in patches/ to be in right order --- just run the makepatchfiles
   script to re-create these files!
 * removed html doc files in src/doc; the .rst doc files are there, so it's a question of
   rebuilding them
   (e.g. one can do sage -sh; cd src/doc; make html)
 * included David's shortened and gcc-version targeted Sun-specific patch
   (comment 88 on #6456); removed sun_complex.h
 * took care of SPKG.txt sections, as mentioned in comment 87 on #6456
 * incorporating building the GLPK extension (track #9598)
 * #9525 Correct the fact that installation of cvxopt will allways
   report it was
   successful, even if it failed.
 * Add a spkg-check file, as #9281 listed cvxopt was missing such a file
 * implemented changes requested in comment 28 of track ticket #6456:

   (kept a harmless SAGE_LOCAL check)

   On building cvxopt extensions:
   the non-required extension are not built;
   however, it is possible to switch on the dsdp and dsl extensions by
   flipping the BUILD_..-flags in setup.py (and modifying dirs for dsdp)
   Remaining extensions were not tested; it should not be hard to have
   them provided the corresponding libs are there (e.g. parts of Sage)

 * modified setup.py to streamline and make it more Sage-like;
   in particular got rid of f77blas and f95 dependences that
   are obsolete, since Sage switched to gfortran
 * rebased Solaris-specific patches from cvxopt-0.9 spkg
   (only cvxopt.h needed to be patched, while the old
    native cvxopt random framework is now gone (since cvxopt-1.1
    at least)
 * modified setup.py and src/python/__init__.py
 * moved old patches to patches-old (solaris, ...) for future reference
 * simplifying spkg-install

=== cvxopt-0.9.p8 (Gonzalo Tornaria, June 19th, 2009) ===
 * Replace perl spkg-install with a bash one.

=== cvxopt-0.9.p7 (Michael Abshoff, September 24th, 2008) ===
 * Work around Solaris 10 problem with complex.h
