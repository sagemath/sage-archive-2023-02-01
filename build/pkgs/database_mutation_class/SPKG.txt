= Mutation class database =

== Description ==

 Contains a database of all exceptional mutation classes of quivers.

 Every file in the database is of the form ``mutation_classes_n.dig6`` for some ``n`` and
 - contains a ``cPickle.dump`` of a dictionary where
   - the keys are tuples representing irreducible exceptional quiver mutation types of rank ``n``, and
   - the values are all quivers in the given mutation class stored in canonical form as ``(dig6,edges)`` where
     - ``dig6`` is the dig6 data of the given ``DiGraph``, and
     - ``edges`` are the non-simply-laced edges thereof.
 - is obtained by running the function
 ``sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.quiver_mutation_type._save_data_dig6(n, types='Exceptional', verbose=False)``
