== Description ==

From http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~jensen/software/gfan/gfan.html: Gfan is a software package for computing Groebner fans and tropical varieties. These are polyhedral fans associated to polynomial ideals. The maximal cones of a Groebner fan are in bijection with the marked reduced Groebner bases of its defining ideal. The software computes all marked reduced Groebner bases of an ideal. Their union is a universal Groebner basis. The tropical variety of a polynomial ideal is a certain subcomplex of the Groebner fan. Gfan contains algorithms for computing this complex for general ideals and specialized algorithms for tropical curves, tropical hypersurfaces and tropical varieties of prime ideals.
