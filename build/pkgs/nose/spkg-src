# Script to prepare a nose spkg for Sage.  This script is only for the
# package maintainer, not for building nose during a Sage install.
# WARNING: This script will delete files in the src directory and its
# subdirectories!
#
# HOW TO MAKE THE SPKG:
# 
# 1) Remove the 'src' directory.
# 2) Download gzipped tar file and move it to 'src'.
# 3) ./spkg-make -- this deletes any pyc files in the subdirectories of src.

# If we decide to download from the git repository, we could automate
# steps 1 and 2, also.

# Sanity check: must be run from current directory
