= Reflexive Polytopes Databases =

== Description ==

This package includes lists of 2- and 3-dimensional reflexive polytopes.

The list of polygons is quite easy to get and it has been known for a while.
The list of 3-polytopes was originally obtained by Maximilian Kreuzer and
Harald Skarke using their software PALP, which is included into the standard
distribution of Sage. To work with lattice and reflexive polytopes from Sage
you can use sage.geometry.lattice_polytope module, which relies on PALP for
some of its functionality. To get access to the databases of this package, use
ReflexivePolytope and ReflexivePolytopes commands.
