== Changelog ==

=== mercurial-1.3.1.p2  (David Kirkby, 21st May 2010)  ===
 * #9009 Mercurial is not building 64-bit with OpenSolaris with SAGE64=yes.
   This just removes the condition the operating system needs to be OS X for
   a 64-bit build.

=== mercurial-1.3.1.p1  ???????????             ===
 * Changes occuracnes of $RM to 'rm', $CP to 'cp' and similar.
   Failure to do so may result in conflicts with #7818

=== mercurial-1.3.1.p0  ???????????             ===

=== mercurial-1.3.1 (John Palmieri, 2009-09-08) ===
 * Updated to Mercurial 1.3.1
 * Moved a patch from "util.py" to "posix.py".
 * In spkg-install, removed the line "perl -p -i -e ..." because it has no
   effect: there are no files matching the pattern src/templates/*.tmpl,
   and the template files src/templates/*/*.tmpl don't contain the
   string ">manifest<".
 * In spkg-install, before the line "$CP patches/hgmerge-osx "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/hgmerge",
   added 'cd "$CUR" ' -- otherwise this command has no effect.

=== mercurial-1.01.p2 (William Stein, Nov 3, 2008) ===
 * Added custom hgmerge script for OS X. For some reason no script at all was
   copied over, which lead to (1) hg merge silently failing painfully for most
   users, and (2) for users that run install_scripts, they would get a fork
   bomb, since hgmerge would call sage -hgmerge which would call hgmerge
   ad infintum.

=== mercurial-1.01.p1 (Michael Abshoff, August 15th, 2008) ===
 * Disable inotify extenion since it is broken on Itanium

=== mercurial-1.01.p0 (Mike Hansen, July 21st, 2008) ===
 * Upgraded to Mercurial 1.01

=== mercurial-0.9.5.p1 (Michael Abshoff, May 22nd, 2008) ===
 * add 64 bit OSX build support

=== mercurial-0.9.5.p0 (Michael Abshoff, Dev. 19th, 2007) ===
 * put relevant files in newly created hg repo
 * updated SPKG.txt :)
 * remove $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python[2.5] dead links (#1175)

=== mercurial-0.9.5 (Carl Witty, Oct. 20th, 2007) ===
 * Upgraded to mercurial 0.9.5.
 * Modified mercurial/util.py to skip looking in /etc/mercurial .

=== 20070106 (William Stein) ===
 * Modified mercurial/util.py to more intelligently choose the encoding, since this was crashing the install on my sage.math chroot jail.
 * no changes from default repo, except that there's a sage subdirectory with a better .css file that gets copied to templates/static during the install.  And another that gets copied to templates/.
 * Ran this command in the templates directory: "replace ">manifest<" ">browse all files<" *.tmpl". I mean, it's *incredibly* unclear what the hecke the "manifest" button is supposed to do.
