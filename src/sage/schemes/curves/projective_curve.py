Projective curves

Projective curves in Sage are curves in a projective space or a projective plane.

EXAMPLES:

We can construct curves in either a projective plane::

    sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
    sage: C = Curve([y*z^2 - x^3], P); C
    Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by -x^3 + y*z^2

or in higher dimensional projective spaces::

    sage: P.<x,y,z,w> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 3)
    sage: C = Curve([y*w^3 - x^4, z*w^3 - x^4], P); C
    Projective Curve over Rational Field defined by -x^4 + y*w^3, -x^4 + z*w^3

Integral projective curves over finite fields
---------------------------------------------

If the curve is defined over a finite field and integral, that is reduced and
irreducible, its function field is tightly coupled with the curve so that
advanced computations based on Sage's global function field machinery are
available.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: k = GF(2)
    sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(k, 2)
    sage: C = Curve(x^2*z - y^3, P)
    sage: C.genus()
    0
    sage: C.function_field()
    Function field in z defined by z + y^3

Closed points of arbitrary degree can be computed::

    sage: C.closed_points()
    [Point (x, y), Point (y, z), Point (x + z, y + z)]
    sage: C.closed_points(2)
    [Point (y^2 + y*z + z^2, x + z)]
    sage: C.closed_points(3)
    [Point (y^3 + y^2*z + z^3, x + y + z),
     Point (x^2 + y*z + z^2, x*y + x*z + y*z, y^2 + x*z + y*z + z^2)]

All singular closed points can be found::

    sage: C.singular_closed_points()
    [Point (x, y)]
    sage: p = _[0]
    sage: p.places()  # a unibranch singularity, that is, a cusp
    [Place (1/y)]
    sage: pls = _[0]
    sage: C.place_to_closed_point(pls)
    Point (x, y)

It is easy to transit to and from the function field of the curve::

    sage: fx = C(x/z)
    sage: fy = C(y/z)
    sage: fx^2 - fy^3
    0
    sage: fx.divisor()
    3*Place (1/y)
     - 3*Place (y)
    sage: p, = fx.poles()
    sage: p
    Place (y)
    sage: C.place_to_closed_point(p)
    Point (y, z)
    sage: _.rational_point()
    (1 : 0 : 0)
    sage: _.closed_point()
    Point (y, z)
    sage: _.place()
    Place (y)

Integral projective curves over `\QQ`
-------------------------------------

An integral curve over `\QQ` is also equipped with the function field. Unlike
over finite fields, it is not possible to enumerate closed points.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
    sage: C = Curve(x^2*z^2 - x^4 - y^4, P)
    sage: C.singular_closed_points()
    [Point (x, y)]
    sage: p, = _
    sage: p.places()
    [Place (1/y, 1/y^2*z - 1), Place (1/y, 1/y^2*z + 1)]
    sage: fy = C.function(y/z)
    sage: fy.divisor()
    Place (1/y, 1/y^2*z - 1)
     + Place (1/y, 1/y^2*z + 1)
     + Place (y, z - 1)
     + Place (y, z + 1)
     - Place (y^4 + 1, z)
    sage: supp = _.support()
    sage: pl = supp[0]
    sage: C.place_to_closed_point(pl)
    Point (x, y)
    sage: pl = supp[1]
    sage: C.place_to_closed_point(pl)
    Point (x, y)
    sage: _.rational_point()
    (0 : 0 : 1)
    sage: _ in C
    True

        Return a birational map from this curve to a plane curve with only ordinary singularities.

        Currently only implemented over number fields. If not all of the coordinates of the non-ordinary
        singularities of this curve are contained in its base field, then the domain and codomain of the
        map returned will be defined over an extension. This curve must be irreducible.

        OUTPUT:

        - a scheme morphism from this curve to a curve with only ordinary singularities that defines a
          birational map between the two curves.
