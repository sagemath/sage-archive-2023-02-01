    Dense matrix over a univariate polynomial ring over a field.

    For a field $\Bold{K}$, we consider matrices over the univariate
    polynomial ring $\Bold{K}[x]$.
    
    They are often used to represent bases of some $\Bold{K}[x]$-modules. In
    this context, there are two possible representations which are both
    commonly used in the literature.

    - Working column-wise: each column of the matrix is a vector in the basis;
      then, a $\\Bold{K}[x]$-submodule of $\\Bold{K}[x]^{m}$ of rank $n$ is
      represented by an $m \\times n$ matrix, whose columns span the module
      (via $\\Bold{K}[x]$-linear combinations). This matrix has full rank,
      and $n \\leq m$.

    - Working row-wise: each row of the matrix is a vector in the basis; then,
      a $\\Bold{K}[x]$-submodule of $\\Bold{K}[x]^{n}$ of rank $m$ is
      represented by an $m \\times n$ matrix, whose rows span the module (via
      $\\Bold{K}[x]$-linear combinations). This matrix has full rank, and $m
      \\leq n$.

    For the rest of this class description, we assume that one is working
    row-wise. For a given such module, all its bases are equivalent under
    left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix, that is, a matrix which has
    determinant in $\Bold{K}\setminus\{0\}$.

    There are bases which are called reduced or minimal: their rows have the
    minimal degree possible among all bases of this module. The degree of a row
    is the maximum of the degrees of the entries of the row. An equivalent
    condition is that the leading matrix of this basis has full rank (see the
    description of :meth:`leading_matrix`). There is a unique minimal basis,
    called the Popov basis of the module, which satisfies some additional
    normalization condition (see the description of :meth:`row_degrees`).

    These notions can be extended via a more general degree measure, involving
    a tuple of integers which is called shift and acts as column degree shifts
    in the definition of row degree. Precisely, for given $s_1,\ldots,s_n \in
    \ZZ$ and a row vector $[p_1 \; \cdots \; p_n] \in \Bold{K}[x]^{1 \times
    n}$, its shifted row degree is the maximum of $\deg(p_j) + s_j$ for $1 \leq
    j \leq n$. Then, minimal bases and Popov bases are defined similarly, with
    respect to this notion of degree.

    Another important canonical basis is the Hermite basis, which is a lower
    triangular matrix satisfying a normalization condition similar to that for
    the Popov basis. In fact, if $d$ is the largest degree appearing in the
    Hermite basis, then the Hermite basis coincide with the shifted Popov basis
    with the shifts $(0,d,2d,\ldots,(n-1)d)$.

        its nonzero rows (resp. columns) are strictly increasing, and for each
        row (resp. column) the pivot entry is monic and has degree strictly
        larger than the other entries in its column (resp. row).

        Since other conventions concerning the ordering of the rows (resp.
        columns) are sometimes useful, an optional argument allows one to test
        whether the matrix is in Popov form up to row (resp. column)
        permutation. For example, there is an alternative definition which
        replaces "leading positions strictly increasing" by "row (resp. column)
        degree nondecreasing, and for rows (resp. columns) of same degree,
        leading positions increasing".

        INPUT:

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        - ``row_wise`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean, ``True`` if
          working row-wise (see the class description).

        - ``up_to_permutation`` -- (option, default: ``False``) boolean,
          ``True`` if testing Popov form up to row permutation (if working
          row-wise).

        - ``include_zero_vectors`` -- (optional, default: ``True``) boolean,
          ``False`` if one does not allow zero rows (resp. zero columns) in
          Popov forms.

        OUTPUT: a boolean.

        The leading position of a row is the right-most position whose entry has

        class description for an introduction to shifts.

          is a unimodular matrix over `\Bold{K}[x]` such that ``self`` equals
          `UW`, where `W` is the output matrix.

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        Return a row reduced form of this matrix.

        An $m \times n$ univariate polynomial matrix $M$ is said to be in
        (shifted) row reduced form if it has $k$ nonzero rows with $k \leq n$
        and its (shifted) leading matrix has rank $k$. See :meth:`is_reduced`
        for more information.

        A row reduced form is non-canonical and a given matrix has many row
        reduced forms; this method returns just one.

        INPUT:

        - ``transformation`` -- (optional, default: ``False``). If this
          ``True``, the transformation matrix `U` will be returned as well: this
          is a unimodular matrix over `\Bold{K}[x]` such that ``self`` equals
          `UR`, where `R` is the output matrix.

        - ``shifts`` -- (optional, default: ``None``) list of integers;
          ``None`` is interpreted as ``shifts=[0,...,0]``.

        OUTPUT:

        - A polynomial matrix `R` which is a reduced form of ``self`` if
          ``transformation=False``; otherwise two polynomial matrices `R, U`
          such that `UA = R` and `R` is reduced and `U` is unimodular where `A`
          is ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: pR.<x> = GF(3)[]
            sage: A = matrix(pR,3,[x,   x^2, x^3,\
                                   x^2, x^1, 0,\
                                   x^3, x^3, x^3])
            sage: R = A.reduced_form(); R
            [        x           x^2       x^3]
            [      x^2             x         0]
            [  x^3 + 2*x x^3 + 2*x^2         0]
            sage: R.is_reduced()
            True
            sage: R2 = A.reduced_form(shifts=[6,3,0]); R2
            [                x               x^2               x^3]
            [                0         2*x^2 + x       2*x^4 + x^3]
            [                0                 0 2*x^5 + x^4 + x^3]
            sage: R2.is_reduced(shifts=[6,3,0])
            True
            sage: R2.is_reduced()
            False

        If the matrix is an `n \times 1` matrix with at least one non-zero entry,
        `R` has a single non-zero entry and that entry is a scalar multiple of
        the greatest-common-divisor of the entries of the matrix::

            sage: A = matrix([[x*(x-1)*(x+1)],[x*(x-2)*(x+2)],[x]])
            sage: R = A.reduced_form()
            sage: R
            [0]
            [0]
            [x]

        A zero matrix is already reduced::

            sage: A = matrix(pR, 2, [0,0,0,0])
            sage: A.reduced_form()
            [0 0]
            [0 0]

        In the following example, the original matrix is already reduced, but
        the output is a different matrix: currently this method is an alias for
        :meth:`weak_popov_form`, which is a stronger reduced form::

            sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
            sage: A = matrix([[x,x,x],[0,0,x]]); A
            [x x x]
            [0 0 x]
            sage: A.is_reduced()
            True
            sage: W = A.reduced_form(); W
            [ x  x  x]
            [-x -x  0]
            sage: W.is_weak_popov()
            True

        The last example shows the usage of the transformation parameter::

            sage: Fq.<a> = GF(2^3)
            sage: pR.<x> = Fq[]
            sage: A = matrix(pR, [[x^2+a,  x^4+a], \
                                  [  x^3,  a*x^4]])
            sage: W,U = A.reduced_form(transformation=True);
            sage: W,U
            (
            [          x^2 + a           x^4 + a]  [1 0]
            [x^3 + a*x^2 + a^2               a^2], [a 1]
            )
            sage: W.is_reduced()
            True
