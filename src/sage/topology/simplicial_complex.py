This module implements the basic structure of finite simplicial
complexes. Given a set `V` of "vertices", a simplicial complex on `V`
is a collection `K` of subsets of `V` satisfying the condition that if
`S` is one of the subsets in `K`, then so is every subset of `S`.  The
subsets `S` are called the 'simplices' of `K`.

.. NOTE::

   In Sage, the elements of the vertex set are determined
   automatically: `V` is defined to be the union of the sets in
   `K`. So in Sage's implementation of simplicial complexes, every
   vertex is included in some face.

A simplicial complex `K` can be viewed as a purely combinatorial
object, as described above, but it also gives rise to a topological
space `|K|` (its *geometric realization*) as follows: first, the
points of `V` should be in general position in euclidean space.  Next,
if `\{v\}` is in `K`, then the vertex `v` is in `|K|`.  If `\{v, w\}`
is in `K`, then the line segment from `v` to `w` is in `|K|`. If `\{u,
v, w\}` is in `K`, then the triangle with vertices `u`, `v`, and `w`
is in `|K|`.  In general, `|K|` is the union of the convex hulls of
simplices of `K`.  Frequently, one abuses notation and uses `K` to
denote both the simplicial complex and the associated topological
space.

.. image:: ../../media/simplices.png

For any simplicial complex `K` and any commutative ring `R` there is
an associated chain complex, with differential of degree `-1`.  The
`n^{th}` term is the free `R`-module with basis given by the
`n`-simplices of `K`.  The differential is determined by its value on
any simplex: on the `n`-simplex with vertices `(v_0, v_1, ..., v_n)`,
the differential is the alternating sum with `i^{th}` summand `(-1)^i`
multiplied by the `(n-1)`-simplex obtained by omitting vertex `v_i`.

In the implementation here, the vertex set must be finite. To define a
simplicial complex, specify its *facets*: the maximal subsets (with
respect to inclusion) of the vertex set belonging to `K`. Each facet
can be specified as a list, a tuple, or a set.

.. NOTE::

   This class derives from
   :class:`~sage.topology.cell_complex.GenericCellComplex`, and so
   inherits its methods.  Some of those methods are not listed here;
   see the :mod:`Generic Cell Complex <sage.topology.cell_complex>`
   page instead.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: SimplicialComplex([[1], [3, 7]])
    Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 3, 7) and facets {(1,), (3, 7)}
    sage: SimplicialComplex()   # the empty simplicial complex
    Simplicial complex with vertex set () and facets {()}
    sage: X = SimplicialComplex([[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,0]])
    sage: X
    Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3) and facets {(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)}

Sage can perform a number of operations on simplicial complexes, such
as the join and the product, and it can also compute homology::

    sage: S = SimplicialComplex([[0,1], [1,2], [0,2]]) # circle
    sage: T = S.product(S)  # torus
    sage: T
    Simplicial complex with 9 vertices and 18 facets
    sage: T.homology()   # this computes reduced homology
    {0: 0, 1: Z x Z, 2: Z}
    sage: T.euler_characteristic()
    0

Sage knows about some basic combinatorial data associated to a
simplicial complex::

    sage: X = SimplicialComplex([[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [0,3]])
    sage: X.f_vector()
    [1, 4, 4]
    sage: X.face_poset()
    Finite poset containing 8 elements
    sage: x0, x1, x2, x3 = X.stanley_reisner_ring().gens()
    sage: x0*x2 == x1*x3 == 0
    True
    sage: X.is_pure()
    True

Mutability (see :trac:`12587`)::

    sage: S = SimplicialComplex([[1,4], [2,4]])
    sage: S.add_face([1,3])
    sage: S.remove_face([1,3]); S
    Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 3, 4) and facets {(3,), (1, 4), (2, 4)}
    sage: hash(S)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: This simplicial complex must be immutable. Call set_immutable().
    sage: S = SimplicialComplex([[1,4], [2,4]])
    sage: S.set_immutable()
    sage: S.add_face([1,3])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: This simplicial complex is not mutable
    sage: S.remove_face([1,3])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: This simplicial complex is not mutable
    sage: hash(S) == hash(S)
    True

    sage: S2 = SimplicialComplex([[1,4], [2,4]], is_mutable=False)
    sage: hash(S2) == hash(S)
    True

We can also make mutable copies of an immutable simplicial complex
(see :trac:`14142`)::

    sage: S = SimplicialComplex([[1,4], [2,4]])
    sage: S.set_immutable()
    sage: T = copy(S)
    sage: T.is_mutable()
    True
    sage: S == T
    True

def lattice_paths(t1, t2, length=None):
    r"""
    Given lists (or tuples or ...) ``t1`` and ``t2``, think of them as
    labelings for vertices: ``t1`` labeling points on the x-axis,
    ``t2`` labeling points on the y-axis, both increasing.  Return the
    list of rectilinear paths along the grid defined by these points
    in the plane, starting from ``(t1[0], t2[0])``, ending at
    ``(t1[last], t2[last])``, and at each grid point, going either
    right or up.  See the examples.

    :param t1: labeling for vertices
    :param t2: labeling for vertices
    :param length: if not ``None``, then an integer, the length of the desired
        path.
    :type length: integer or ``None``; optional, default ``None``
    :type t1: list, other iterable
    :type t2: list, other iterable
    :return: list of lists of vertices making up the paths as described above
    :rtype: list of lists

    This is used when triangulating the product of simplices.  The
    optional argument ``length`` is used for `\Delta`-complexes, to
    specify all simplices in a product: in the triangulation of a
    product of two simplices, there is a `d`-simplex for every path of
    length `d+1` in the lattice.  The path must start at the bottom
    left and end at the upper right, and it must use at least one
    point in each row and in each column, so if ``length`` is too
    small, there will be no paths.

        Algorithm: see Hatcher, p. 277-278 [Hat2002]_ (who in turn refers to
        Eilenberg-Steenrod, p. 68): given ``S = Simplex(m)`` and
        ``T = Simplex(n)``, then `S \times T` can be
        triangulated as follows: for each path `f` from `(0,0)` to
        `(m,n)` along the integer grid in the plane, going up or right
        at each lattice point, associate an `(m+n)`-simplex with
        vertices `v_0`, `v_1`, ..., where `v_k` is the `k^{th}` vertex
        in the path `f`.

        Note that there are `m+n` choose `n` such paths.  Note also
        that each vertex in the product is a pair of vertices `(v,w)`
        where `v` is a vertex in the left-hand factor and `w`

        This method allows one to construct a coproduct from the
        `p+q`-chains to the tensor product of the `p`-chains and the
        `q`-chains. The number 1 (a Sage integer) is the coefficient
        of ``left tensor right`` in this coproduct. (The corresponding

        cubical complex, and the output format is intended to be
        consistent for both cubes and simplices.)

        Calling this method ``alexander_whitney`` is an abuse of

    ``maximal_faces`` should be a list or tuple or set (indeed,
    anything which may be converted to a set) whose elements are lists
    (or tuples, etc.) of vertices.  Maximal faces are also known as
    'facets'. ``maximal_faces`` can also be a list containing a single
    non-negative integer `n`, in which case this constructs the
    simplicial complex with a single `n`-simplex as the only facet.

    Alternatively, the maximal faces can be defined from a monotone boolean
    function on the subsets of a set `X`. While defining ``maximal_faces=None``,
    you can thus set ``from_characteristic_function=(f,X)`` where ``X`` is the
    set of points and ``f`` a boolean monotone hereditary function that accepts
    a list of elements from ``X`` as input (see
    :func:`~sage.combinat.subsets_hereditary.subsets_with_hereditary_property`
    for more information).

    If ``maximality_check`` is ``True``, check that each maximal face is,
    in fact, maximal. In this case, when producing the internal
    representation of the simplicial complex, omit those that are not.
    It is highly recommended that this be ``True``; various methods for
    this class may fail if faces which are claimed to be maximal are
    in fact not.

    ``sort_facets``: if not set to ``None``, the default, this should
    be a dictionary, used for sorting the vertices in each facet. The
    keys must be the vertices for the simplicial complex, and the
    values should be distinct sortable objects, for example
    integers. This should not need to be specified except in very
    special circumstances; currently the only use in the Sage library
    is when defining the product of a simplicial complex with itself:
    in this case, the vertices in the product must be sorted
    compatibly with the vertices in each factor so that the diagonal
    map is properly defined.

    If ``name_check`` is ``True``, check the names of the vertices to see
    if they can be easily converted to generators of a polynomial ring
    -- use this if you plan to use the Stanley-Reisner ring for the
    simplicial complex.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: SimplicialComplex([[1,2], [1,4]])
        Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 4) and facets {(1, 2), (1, 4)}
        sage: SimplicialComplex([[0,2], [0,3], [0]])
        Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 2, 3) and facets {(0, 2), (0, 3)}
        sage: SimplicialComplex([[0,2], [0,3], [0]], maximality_check=False)
        Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 2, 3) and facets {(0,), (0, 2), (0, 3)}

    Finally, if the first argument is a simplicial complex, return
    that complex.  If it is an object with a built-in conversion to
    simplicial complexes (via a ``_simplicial_`` method), then the
    resulting simplicial complex is returned::

        sage: S = SimplicialComplex([[0,2], [0,3], [0,6]])
        sage: SimplicialComplex(S) == S
        True
        sage: Tc = cubical_complexes.Torus(); Tc
        Cubical complex with 16 vertices and 64 cubes
        sage: Ts = SimplicialComplex(Tc); Ts
        Simplicial complex with 16 vertices and 32 facets
        sage: Ts.homology()
        {0: 0, 1: Z x Z, 2: Z}

    In the situation where the first argument is a simplicial complex
    or another object with a built-in conversion, most of the other
    arguments are ignored. The only exception is ``is_mutable``::

        sage: S.is_mutable()
        True
        sage: SimplicialComplex(S, is_mutable=False).is_mutable()

    of all subsets `S\subseteq \{0,1,2,3,4\}` such that `sum(S)\leq 4`::

        sage: SimplicialComplex(from_characteristic_function=(lambda x:sum(x)<=4, range(5)))

        sage: f = lambda S: not any(len(set(S).intersection(x))>2 for x in l)

        Simplicial complexes are not proper parents as they do

        Otherwise: if ``subcomplex`` is ``None``, replace it with a
        facet -- a contractible subcomplex of the original complex.
        Then as long as ``enlarge`` is ``True``, no matter what
        ``subcomplex`` is, replace it with a subcomplex `L` which is
        homotopy equivalent and as large as possible.  Compute the
        homology of the original complex relative to `L`: if `L` is
        large, then the relative chain complex will be small enough to
        speed up computations considerably.

        We need an immutable complex to compute homology generators::

            sage: sphere.set_immutable()
            sage: sphere._homology_(generators=True, algorithm='no_chomp')
            {0: [], 1: [], 2: [(Z, (0, 1, 2) - (0, 1, 3) + (0, 2, 3) - (1, 2, 3))]}

        Note that the answer may be formatted differently if the
        optional package CHomP is installed.

        Another way to get a two-sphere: take a two-point space and take its
        three-fold join with itself::

            sage: S = SimplicialComplex([[0], [1]])
            sage: (S*S*S)._homology_(dim=2, cohomology=True)
            Z

        The same computation, done without finding a contractible subcomplex::

            sage: (S*S*S)._homology_(dim=2, cohomology=True, enlarge=False)
            Z

        Relative homology::

            sage: T = SimplicialComplex([[0,1,2]])
            sage: U = SimplicialComplex([[0,1], [1,2], [0,2]])
            sage: T._homology_(subcomplex=U)
            {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: Z}

        Algebraic topological model for this simplicial complex with
        coefficients in ``base_ring``.

        The term "algebraic topological model" is defined by Pilarczyk
        and Réal [PR2015]_.

        INPUT:

        - ``base_ring`` - coefficient ring (optional, default
          ``QQ``). Must be a field.

        Denote by `C` the chain complex associated to this simplicial
        complex. The algebraic topological model is a chain complex
        `M` with zero differential, with the same homology as `C`,
        along with chain maps `\pi: C \to M` and `\iota: M \to C`
        satisfying `\iota \pi = 1_M` and `\pi \iota` chain homotopic
        to `1_C`. The chain homotopy `\phi` must satisfy

        - `\phi \phi = 0`,
        - `\pi \phi = 0`,
        - `\phi \iota = 0`.

        Such a chain homotopy is called a *chain contraction*.

        OUTPUT: a pair consisting of

        - chain contraction ``phi`` associated to `C`, `M`, `\pi`, and
          `\iota`
        - the chain complex `M`

        Note that from the chain contraction ``phi``, one can recover the
        chain maps `\pi` and `\iota` via ``phi.pi()`` and
        ``phi.iota()``. Then one can recover `C` and `M` from, for
        example, ``phi.pi().domain()`` and ``phi.pi().codomain()``,
        respectively.

           This does not check that ``self`` and ``other`` are manifolds,

           then glued together, this method may return random
           results if applied to non-manifolds, depending on which
           facet is chosen.

        Algorithm: a facet is chosen from each surface, and removed.
        The vertices of these two facets are relabeled to
        ``(0,1,...,dim)``.  Of the remaining vertices, the ones from
        the left-hand factor are renamed by prepending an "L", and

        ALGORITHM:

        The algorithm comes from a paper by Shtan'ko and Shtogrin, as
        reported by Bukhshtaber and Panov.  Let `I^m` denote the unit
        `m`-cube, viewed as a cubical complex.  Let `[m] = \{1, 2,
        ..., m\}`; then each face of `I^m` has the following form, for
        subsets `I \subset J \subset [m]`:

        .. MATH::

            F_{I \subset J} = \{ (y_1,...,y_m) \in I^m \,:\, y_i =0 \text{
            for } i \in I, y_j = 1 \text{ for } j \not \in J\}.

        If `K` is a simplicial complex on vertex set `[m]` and if `I
        \subset [m]`, write `I \in K` if `I` is a simplex of `K`.
        Then we associate to `K` the cubical subcomplex of `I^m` with
        faces

        .. MATH::

            \{F_{I \subset J} \,:\, J \in K, I \neq \emptyset \}

        The geometric realization of this cubical complex is
        homeomorphic to the geometric realization of the original
        simplicial complex.

    def fundamental_group(self, base_point=None, simplify=True):
        r"""
        Return the fundamental group of this simplicial complex.

        INPUT:

        - ``base_point`` (optional, default None) -- if this complex is
          not path-connected, then specify a vertex; the fundamental
          group is computed with that vertex as a base point. If the
          complex is path-connected, then you may specify a vertex or
          leave this as its default setting of ``None``. (If this
          complex is path-connected, then this argument is ignored.)

        - ``simplify`` (bool, optional True) -- if False, then return a
          presentation of the group in terms of generators and
          relations. If True, the default, simplify as much as GAP is
          able to.

        Algorithm: we compute the edge-path group -- see
        :wikipedia:`Fundamental_group`. Choose a spanning tree for the
        1-skeleton, and then the group's generators are given by the
        edges in the 1-skeleton; there are two types of relations:
        `e=1` if `e` is in the spanning tree, and for every 2-simplex,
        if its edges are `e_0`, `e_1`, and `e_2`, then we impose the
        relation `e_0 e_1^{-1} e_2 = 1`.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: S1 = simplicial_complexes.Sphere(1)
            sage: S1.fundamental_group()
            Finitely presented group < e |  >

        If we pass the argument ``simplify=False``, we get generators and
        relations in a form which is not usually very helpful. Here is the
        cyclic group of order 2, for instance::

            sage: RP2 = simplicial_complexes.RealProjectiveSpace(2)
            sage: C2 = RP2.fundamental_group(simplify=False)
            sage: C2
            Finitely presented group < e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, e9 | e0, e3, e4, e7, e9, e5*e2^-1*e0, e7*e2^-1*e1, e8*e3^-1*e1, e8*e6^-1*e4, e9*e6^-1*e5 >
            sage: C2.simplified()
            Finitely presented group < e1 | e1^2 >

        This is the same answer given if the argument ``simplify`` is True
        (the default)::

            sage: RP2.fundamental_group()
            Finitely presented group < e1 | e1^2 >

        You must specify a base point to compute the fundamental group
        of a non-connected complex::

            sage: K = S1.disjoint_union(RP2)
            sage: K.fundamental_group()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: this complex is not connected, so you must specify a base point

            sage: K.fundamental_group(base_point='R0').order()
