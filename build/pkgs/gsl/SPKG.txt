== Description ==

Website: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

From the website above: The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical
library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General
Public License.

The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random
number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are
over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite. If the variable
SAGE_CHECK is exported to the val "yes" when building Sage, GSL's test suite
is run.

== License ==

== SPKG Maintainers ==

 * William Stein

== Upstream Contact ==

 * http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

GSL mailing lists:

 * Bug-gsl <bug-gsl@gnu.org> mailing list -- bug reports for the GNU
   Scientific Library should be sent to bug-gsl@gnu.org
 * Help-gsl <help-gsl@gnu.org> users mailing list -- for questions about
   installation, how GSL works and how it is used, or general questions
   concerning GSL.
 * Info-gsl <info-gsl@gnu.org> mailing list -- announcements of new releases
   are made there.

== Dependencies ==

 * None - GSL does currently not depend on any other Sage package to
   compile, link and pass all GSL's self-tests. However, as of
   20th July 2010, ATLAS is listed as a dependency in spkg/standard/deps.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * According to the GSL web page: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
   "GSL requires a BLAS library for vector and matrix operations. The
   default CBLAS library supplied with GSL can be replaced by the tuned
   ATLAS library for better performance". Exactly how one would use ATLAS is
   not clear (there are no obvious options for the 'configure' script),
   but in principle it could be done.

== Changelog ==

=== gsl-1.14 (David Kirkby, 20th July 2010) ===
 * #9533 Update GSL to the latest upstream release - the previous
   version (1.10) was nearly 3 years old.
 * Reformatted this file for 80 characters width.
 * Added 'exit 1' to spkg-install so the build terminates
   if 'configure' fails to run properly.
 * Same as above, when running 'make'
 * Same as above, when running 'make install'
 * Removed the option --enable-shared from the
   configure script, as the default is to make
   shared libraries (see src/INSTALL)
 * Removed all patches. I doubt they are useful when they are on a version
   of GSL that is nearly 3 years old.  It is better to resolve problems if
   found, rather than try to use patches made against a very outdated
   version of GSL.
   The GSL test suite has passed all tests on systems running Cygwin,
   Linux, HP-UX (PA-RISC processor), OpenSolaris x64, OS X (x86) and
   Solaris (SPARC processor).
 * Used $MAKE for building, as building in parallel is
   reliable.
 * $MAKE is also used in spkg-check for testing GSL in
   parallel. The GSL has been tested on around 50 parallel builds in
   total on Linux, OpenSolaris, OS X and Solaris. Each time
   all the self-tests of GSL pass. From 2 to 1000 threads were
   used.
 * Removed reference to GPL 2 in earlier releases - it is
   irrelevant what licence previous releases of GSL were
   released under.
 * Removed notes about patches on OS X. GSL would appear to
   handle OS X properly.
 * Added the "Special Update/Build Instructions" section from SPKG.txt which
   was previously missing.
 * Added notes to SPKG.txt about an unnecessary ATLAS dependency in
   $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps
 * Added notes to SPKG.txt about how ATLAS could in principle be used to
   improve the performance of some of GSL's functionality.
 * Force GSL to be build with no optimisation if SAGE_DEBUG is set to "yes"
 * Check that $SAGE_ROOT is defined both in spkg-install and spkg-check.
 * Exported LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS on 64-bit builds. This is unnecessary
   with the current version of GSL, but it may become necessary on later
   revisions, so it is safer to add this now.
 * spkg-install and spkg-check now make use of the environment variable
   CFLAG64 which can be used to specify an alternate compiler flag to
   -m64 when building a 64-bit version of the library.

=== gsl-1.10.p2 (Jaap Spies,  Jan 25th, 2010) ===
 * Made SAGE64=yes work for Open Solaris 64 bit
 * Removed Michael as maintainer

=== gsl-1.10.p1 (Michael Abshoff, April 20th, 2008) ===
 * always use GSL's isinf (fixes #2973)

=== gsl-1.10-p0 (Michael Abshoff, Jan. 26, 2008) ===
 * fix 64 OSX build
 * fix spkg-check target
 * work around isinf bug on OSX

=== gsl-1.10 (Michael Abshoff, Jan. 25, 2008) ===
 * update to gsl 1.10
 * add .hgignore
 * write proper SPKG.txt

=== gsl-1.9 ===
 * initial release

== Build Notes ==
 * None
